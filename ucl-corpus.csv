1,Call for Papers: Deadline 24 April 2022,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2022/apr/call-papers-deadline-24-april-2022,1 April 2022,"(Julie Livingston, Self-Devouring Growth, 2019) The Urban Lab and the Institute of Advanced Studies are interlacing their respective research themes of Emergency and Growth in a cross-disciplinary symposium to reflect critically on each of these concepts and on their relationship to each other in the current moment.  Two half-day workshops for c. 25-30 invited participants to discuss pre-circulated papers will be bridged by an evening panel presentation of 3-4 keynote speakers, including Q&A with a public audience. The idea that growth – economic, biological, scientific and personal – establishes a secure foundation for the future underpinned the modern era and has proved remarkably persistent despite the increasing volume and intensity of criticism to which it has been subjected over the last two decades. This symposium is prompted by an urge to discuss the extent to which the conditions for debate have been irreversibly changed by the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period emergency measures have been imposed by governments of all political stripes to suspend normal economic and social activity throughout the world, and much discussion of the need to implement new and better models of operation post-pandemic has been aired. At the same time, there has been an acceleration of extreme weather events, which have increasingly affected parts of the world hitherto accustomed to temperate living conditions. Public discourse has mutated from a framework of crisis to one of emergency: we are no longer talking about a crisis of capitalism or even a crisis of civilisation, but instead of a state of planetary emergency that threatens our very existence, and challenges certain assumptions around continuous growth as a desirable paradigm for the future. Our symposium has three aims: To take stock of debates on growth (degrowth; agrowth) in light of the pandemic. We now have global evidence about what the ‘pedagogy of catastrophe’ (Latouche) looks like in practice. How does this alter the conditions for thinking, beyond the obvious injection of urgency? Is it easier or harder to imagine compelling new futures, especially from within the universities? To generate deep cross-disciplinary exploration of the capacious concept of growth, which ranges across the social and natural domains to describe a huge variety of phenomena from miniscule particles of living matter to the complex social assemblages of mega-cities. Our starting point is that in order to stand any chance of understanding the enduring power of growth as a concept we will need to think across borders of all kinds: geographical, temporal, institutional and disciplinary. To bring into the mainstream theories, insights and examples from as many parts of the world as possible, given that the concept of growth means such different things in different places. Two examples with which the organisers happen to be familiar from their own work are the Scandinavian model of consolidation and repair and the Latin American philosophy of buen vivir, in which living well entails social justice, connectedness to other people and harmony with the natural world.  In many parts of the world, there is a deep history of criticism of ‘modernization’, ‘development’ and their correlates of exponential growth and trickle-down benefits, but these ideas, especially from the global South, are still relatively unknown in discussions that purport to be planetary in remit. Through combining these three aims we hope to generate new thinking on questions such as:  Are terms such as ‘sustainable development’ or ‘Green growth’ inescapably self-contradictory and wedded to the avoidance of necessary change? Is it possible or even desirable to break with the logic of growth? Which other concepts might we bring to bear to calibrate the possibilities for human and nonhuman flourishing? In current conditions, what realistic options are there for re-configuring our economies, our cities, our societies –not to mention our universities-- in the face of the multiple emergencies we face, and to redress fundamental historic inequalities in access to the planet’s resources?   There will be two half-day workshops for invited participants (25-30 people), plus a panel discussion with 3-4 keynote speakers, open to a public audience, held on the evening of the first day. At the workshops, we will spend most of the time in discussion. For that reason, paper-givers will be asked to circulate a draft text of c 5,000 words two weeks in advance.  There will be no formal presentations on the day, but time-slots will be allocated for discussion of each paper, as well as time for open free-ranging discussion. We invite paper proposals on any aspect of Growth in relation to Emergency, including (but not limited to) the economics, (geo-)politics, health, ethics and aesthetics of growth. We hope to bring together economists, philosophers, geographers, historians, art historians, anthropologists, architects, artists and any other specialists working in the field. The workshops will be organised thematically on the basis on proposals received. We intend to publish a selection of the papers in an open access volume with UCL Press. Clare Melhuish, Director of UCL Urban Laboratory Nicola Miller, Director of UCL Institute of Advanced Studies Please send an abstract of 500 words maximum and a two-page c.v. to p.llombart@ucl.ac.uk by midnight on Sunday 24 April 2022.

It will equip students from a range of different academic and professional backgrounds with the critical skills and specialist knowledge to operate as an urbanist in today's global environment, collaborating across sectors to tackle urgent challenges and shape fairer cities. It is the first urban Master’s degree to radically cut across arts, humanities, social sciences and technology studies, providing the opportunity to specialise in urbanism as a challenge-driven and practice-oriented transdisciplinary field.  It is designed to enable students to benefit from UCL’s extensive research experience and partnerships from across the urban world, and to work with its expertise and collections on London, which have been influential in shaping the capital. It is embedded in the activities of UCL Urban Laboratory and its world-leading expertise in promoting holistic and collaborative responses to complex urban conditions, from across the arts, humanities, social sciences, technology and the built environment. The MASc offers a choice of two pathways, Global Studio or London Studio. In addition to a shared core curriculum, each pathway offers the opportunity to build critical understandings of global urbanism, specialising either in the highly globalised urban context of London, or in a selected international partner city. It will be delivered in a collaborative and experimental research setting, UCL's new campus in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, east London, enabling students to engage with the dynamics of urbanization in the local environs, through collaboration with the university’s local and international partners.  Staff and students will benefit from high-quality, purpose-designed facilities for transdisciplinary postgraduate research, including priority access to the UCL Urban Room, a new research-led, public-facing space for exhibitions, debate and collaboration on the past, present and future of cities. This is a 1-year (full-time) or 2-year (part-time) programme. It provides a route for those wishing to pursue further advanced urban research, on London or other cities, such as doctoral studies, and/or a professional development pathway for those working (or aiming to develop a career) in a position that requires understanding the contexts and complexity of urban challenges and development in cities internationally.

4,Olympic Legacy Conference: Call for Contributions,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2022/mar/olympic-legacy-conference-call-contributions,3 March 2022,"2022 marks the 10th anniversary of the London 2012 Olympic Games. The Bartlett’s UCL Urban Laboratory and Institute for Global Prosperity (IGP) in collaboration with the University of East London, Cardiff University (Welsh School of Architecture) and Oxford Brookes University, are organising a conference on Monday 12th and Tuesday 13th September 2022 at venues in and around the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London E20, to interrogate and critically reflect on London’s Olympic and Paralympic legacy in the post-games period, from social and spatial justice perspectives. Following a decade of planned regeneration, it is our intention to analyse its effects in the context of longer processes of social, economic, and physical transformation in east London over the last 40 years and explore the changing urban political imaginaries and policy agendas that have shaped approaches to regeneration practice and research during that time. The goals are: a)  to critically analyse regeneration policies, impacts, and research in east London before and after the Olympics, foregrounding a variety of voices and perspectives on transformative processes from the redevelopment of London’s Docklands in the 1990s to the various phases of Olympic regeneration, and plans for the future redevelopment of Silvertown and the Royal Docks. b) to identify evidence-based lessons relevant to future urban planning and regeneration in the UK including the levelling up agenda, and other Olympic host cities including Paris 2024. The programme for the conference events will be organised around, and inclusive of, a range of formats, from research papers and presentations, to film, storytelling and visual media, and question and answer style sessions.   Conference attendance is free of charge, and for those unable to attend in person there will be an opportunity to make an online contribution.  Contributions from community-based researchers, civil society organisations, policy researchers, professional urbanists, and creative practitioners, as well as academics from different disciplines and at various career stages, are strongly encouraged in response to, but not limited to, the following themes: How have Legacy rhetoric and policies evolved over the last decade? Examples may include legacy commitments, or concepts of inclusive regeneration and convergence. How have the ‘gains’ from London 2012 regeneration been distributed socially, spatially and economically? Whose legacy stories are heard and whose are not heard? What are the practical and transferable lessons for future regeneration policies, practice, and scholarship in the UK including the levelling-up agenda, as well as in other Olympic host cities including Paris 2024? Can sports-led mega-events and culture-led regeneration be galvanised for the public good? How can universities contribute to inclusive regeneration/good growth in areas with high levels of deprivation such as East London? How do we situate legacy in the context of longer processes of social, economic, and physical transformation in east London, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic? What does legacy look, sound and feel like in 2022? We invite prospective participants to submit proposals for contributions in a variety of formats, e.g., visual/textual/performance-led etc, using the online form here.  Deadline Tuesday 19th April, 12 noon (BST).

5,Urban Walks Series,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2022/feb/urban-walks-series-0,25 February 2022," From Saturday 26th February, the UCL Urban Laboratory will host the first of a series of urban walks centred around our annual theme of ‘Emergency’. With each walk led by a different urbanist, anthropologist, activist or author, we will start near UCL’s Bloomsbury campus and each week head further east, eventually taking in the ongoing construction of UCL East in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and entering London’s edgelands. As ever, the Urban Laboratory is committed to engaging with those outside of academia to look at a wide variety of issues facing urban life. Walk leaders will lead discussions on everything, from the housing crisis and river pollution, to night-time safety and gentrification, and each walk will be free and open to the public. The programme will cover parts of the capital packed with history, culture and controversy, and often overlooked spaces of wilderness such as the Channelsea River and the surprisingly beautiful surroundings of Beckton Sewage Works. If you are still recovering from the effects of lockdown and fancy exploring the city, we’d love for you to join us. Numbers are limited and free tickets will be made available on Eventbrite seven days prior to each walk. Please do only book a ticket if you are committed to joining. We plan to go ahead regardless of all but the most severe weather conditions. Saturday 26th Feb 2022 | 1100-1300 | Tom Bolton | Start: Kings X Station | End: Kings X Station Despite their proximity to busy central London and to UCL, the neighbourhoods behind Euston, King’s Cross and St. Pancras stations are cut off by railway lines, canals and busy roads. We will visit Somers Town, the village of radicals; Elm Village, once condemned as London’s worst slum; the Maiden Lane Estate, a tangle of decks, alleys and hidden corners; and Belle Isle, a strange part of London’s mythology: a landscape of change, social contrast and urban complexity. Sunday 6th Mar 2022 | 1100-1300 | Ashley Hickson-Lovence | Start: Hoxton Station | End: Dalston Junction Station ""True say though, I have to say, it’s always changing round here. Shops that used to sell carpet cleaner and cat toys, now sell those tiny espresso coffees that are too strong and make your breath kick..."" An exploratory journey from Hoxton to Dalston, which will draw on the lived experiences of author of The 392, Ashley Hickson-Lovence. The walk will follow the first part of the fictional 392 bus route, exploring the local landmarks and discussing the impact of gentrification of the area. Friday 11th Mar 2022 | Evening | Satu Streatfield | Location unconfirmed Satu Streatfield is Associate Director (Night-time and Lighting) at Publica. In 2021, she led the GLA-commissioned 'Night Time Strategy Guidance' work, contributed to the Night Time Commission’s ‘Think Night’ report, and regularly conducts night walks as a way of engaging stakeholders. This walk, held in the evening, will focus on many of the unlit routes in central London – in search of urban darkness. Torches recommended. Sunday 20th Mar 2022 | 1100-1300 | Joseph Cook | Start: Hackney Wick Station | End: East Ham Station Joseph Cook is an anthropologist and boater. This walk will include sections of the River Lea, the Olympic site, and the site of UCL East, and will cover topics such as the housing crisis and London’s live aboard boating communities; the industrial history of the River Lea, and the continuing development of Stratford. Saturday 2nd Apr 2022 | 1100-1330 | Tom Chivers | Start: West Ham Station | End: To be confirmed Poet, author of the recent book ‘London Clay’, and keen mudlarker, Tom Chivers, will lead this walk of Bow Creek and the new developments happening at the Thames foreshore in east London. Sunday 10th Apr 2022 | 1100-1300 | Aude Vuilli | Start: Plaistow Station | End: QEOP Stadium Aude is a PhD Student at The Bartlett CASA. She is researching the integration of electronic sensors in green infrastructure to monitor ecological biodiversity. The walk will start at Plaistow Station and head south towards Lister Gardens and Plaistow Park, before joining the Green Way. The walk will then continue in the direction of the QEOP, stopping around Abbey Mills pumping station, Three Mills park and the  Pudding Mill allotments. It will explore the architecture and design of green and blue infrastructure, discuss possible actions to increase biodiversity, and shed light on some of the tensions between urban development and natural resources. If you have some binoculars, you might want to bring them with you! Saturday 24th Apr 2022 |1100-1300 | Paul Powseland | Start: Barking Abbey | End: Creekmouth Barking This walk will be led by barrister, activist, and Chairman of the River Roding Trust, Paul Powseland. The River Roding is London's third largest river and used to be home to the UK's largest fishing fleet. There is a wealth of memory and history along its banks, some of which are undergoing hugely intensive development, but some of which are silently retreating back into the Thames estuary mud. Join us as we explore these layers of past and present along the Roding."

7,UCL SSEES FRINGE Centre - call for proposals,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2021/nov/ucl-ssees-fringe-centre-call-proposals,23 November 2021,"The UCL SSEES FRINGE Centre calls for proposals for small grant research projects for the 2021-22 academic year. In keeping with the FRINGE ethos, proposals should be broadly interdisciplinary in nature. We particularly welcome projects that: • embody or reflect upon the conception of Critical Area Studies (see below) as fostered at SSEES (The School of Slavonic and East European Studies) and at IAS (the Institute of Advanced Studies) • engage with the mission and themes of the FRINGE Centre (see below) • foreground critical visions, mappings and perspectives stemming from or rooted in (post-) socialist and/or (de-)colonial worlds All UCL academic staff and postgraduate research students are encouraged to apply and proposals will be evaluated by a multi-disciplinary committee of colleagues. The scope of projects is open, but can include funding to cover the cost of a symposium, a seminar mini-series, an exhibition or another type of research-rooted event. Given the short timeframe and the complexity of conducting research projects in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, FRINGE will not at this time support fieldwork visits or overseas travel for UCL members of staff and research students. For examples of projects previously supported by FRINGE, see the Events section of the FRINGE Centre website. Please send one-page proposals (.doc or .pdf), including a short statement of purpose, project background, timeline and budget (max. L1,500) to FRINGE@ucl.ac.uk by 17 December 2021. Please also include your full name, UCL Department and job title or programme of study. The combined length of the statement of purpose and project background should not exceed 500 words and the whole document (Helvetica or Times New Roman, size 11) should not exceed one page of A4. Successful applicants will be notified by the end of January 2022. Funds should be spent and projects completed by July 2022, but there may in some instances be scope to extend the funding until December 2022. If you wish to extend your project until December, please provide a clear justification for doing so in your project timeline. Please direct any enquiries to FRINGE Director Dr Michał Murawski: m.murawski@ucl.ac.uk The FRINGE Centre explores the roles that complexity, ambivalence and immeasurability play in social and cultural phenomena. A cross-disciplinary initiative bringing together scholars from the humanities and social sciences, FRINGE examines how seemingly opposed notions such as centrality and marginality, and clarity and ambiguity, can shift and converge when embedded in everyday practices. Our interest lies in the hidden complexity of all embedded practices, taken-for-granted and otherwise invisible subjects. Illuminating the 'fringe' thus puts the 'centre' in a new light. The FRINGE Centre is an initiative founded by UCL’s School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), which works within the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) framework to pursue Critical Area Studies. Learn more about FRINGE Critical Area Studies Area Studies has often been understood not simply in contrast but indeed in subordination to the traditional academic disciplines: as mere application to a particular region of the general principles formulated within university disciplines. Critical Area Studies, by contrast, centres on the conviction that knowledge generated from the ‘bottom up’—that is, from particular contexts and with specialist understanding of local complexities—does not simply apply but in fact alters and even produces general principles. Further, Critical Area Studies is committed to the idea that interdisciplinary inquiry brings innovative perspectives that the traditional disciplines, or even multi-disciplinary combinations thereof, often overlook.

8,Film screening: Breathing Space,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2021/oct/film-screening-breathing-space,25 October 2021,"At the height of the first UK lockdown, East London’s Victoria Park closed its gates to visitors for the longest period in its 175-year history. In one of the country’s most densely populated boroughs, with high-rise blocks and severely overcrowded housing, many locals were deprived of access to green space altogether. Breathing Space is the result of a collaborative effort between UCL anthropology PhD student Caroline Wilson, Hackney-based artist Karolina Raczynski and the park’s community. In this experimental documentary film, park staff and visitors reflect on the local experience and understanding of this global pandemic. The accompanying imagery includes photography by interviewees and the filmmaker´s own video and microscope footage of the park´s animal and plant life. Breathing Space is intended as a meditation on the role of public green space and communion with nature in a borough with widespread deprivation and isolation. The film will be presented as a looped installation in the Hub building at Victoria Park from 11.00-14:30 with a Q+A at 15:00 hosted by the UCL Urban Lab. Book now via Eventbrite"

Using the influential work of sociologist Prof AbdouMaliq Simone on Blackness and the Urban as a starting point, this new podcast series sources different perspectives on the utility of the term ‘Black Urbanisms’ and what it can offer us as we think about cities and urban experience.Hosted by Dr Alana Osbourne (Université Libre de Bruxelles), Black Urbanisms emerges from two Urban Lab sessions curated by Prof Jennifer Robinson in 2019 as part of an international conference on emerging themes and critical methodologies at the frontiers of urban theory and practice and features contributions from Dr Lioba Hirsch, Prof Ola Uduku, Dr Hélène Neveu-Kringelbach, Victoria Okoye, Dr Evance Mwathunga, and Prof Wilbard Kombé. In the first episode, host Dr Alana Osbourne revisits excerpts of Prof AbdouMaliq Simone’s 2019 talk from the conference that considered the multiplicities of Black Urbanisms as a series of refrains, calls and responses, parallel but complicit investigations and makings. The aim here is to interpret some of his insights and transpose them to urban research in various cities.Other episodes, which will be released every Friday throughout October, consider Blackness as a form of unsettling in the racialised city, Prof Simone’s notion of the “hallucination of Whiteness”, and theorising from Africa.

11,UCL Urban Laboratory joins The Bartlett,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/news/2021/sep/ucl-urban-laboratory-joins-bartlett,20 September 2021,"The formalisation follows detailed consultation with the Urban Lab Co-Director group and 30+ members of the Urban Laboratory Steering Committee, the Bartlett Dean Christoph Lindner, The Bartlett Management Advisory Group, and the Deans of Arts and Humanities, Engineering and Social and Historical Sciences. Since its beginnings in 2005, the UCL Urban Laboratory has flourished as a trans-faculty, cross-disciplinary research centre, bringing together the very best of urban research from the arts, humanities, built environment disciplines and social sciences, with its administrative home first in the Department of Geography (SHS) and then in The Bartlett Faculty Office. Through a commitment to cross-disciplinary enquiry and external engagement, UCL Urban Laboratory has enabled collaboration with a wide range of external organisations, makers, activists, academics and students, nationally and internationally. Now, more than ever, it is vital to establish a more secure and sustainable home for its innovative and creative network of urbanists and expertise extending across the University and beyond. Going forward, the UCL Urban Laboratory will be able to recruit lecturers, host researchers and support students more effectively from its new base in The Bartlett, while still maintaining its established cross-faculty governance structure and opportunity for future Urban Laboratory directors to be recruited from any faculty. The Bartlett is confident that this move will ensure that UCL Urban Laboratory can further the impact and quality of its research in line with the original vision of Urban Lab as a generator of collaborative and holistic approaches to complex urban problems. UCL Urban Laboratory will continue to play a key role in the development of The Bartlett at our UCL East campus through collaborative programming for the Urban Room and Memory Workshop with the School for Creative and Cultural Industries, as well as through its new teaching programme: MASc Global Urbanism. This will be the first taught degree housed solely within the Urban Laboratory since MSc Urban Studies settled in Geography a decade ago, providing a fantastic opportunity to grow UCL’s cross-disciplinary community of urban researchers and practitioners of tomorrow. Urban Laboratory students, drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds and interests, will make a strong contribution to UCL departments beyond the Bartlett through their studies and activities.

13,"""Thinking Like a Climate"" book launch",https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2021/may/thinking-climate-book-launch,25 May 2021,"In her new book, Thinking Like a Climate, Hannah Knox confronts the challenges that climate change poses to knowledge production and modern politics. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among policy makers, politicians, activists, scholars, and the public in Manchester, England—birthplace of the Industrial Revolution—Knox explores the city's strategies for understanding and responding to deteriorating environmental conditions. Climate science, Knox argues, frames climate change as a very particular kind of social problem that confronts the limits of administrative and bureaucratic techniques of knowing people, places, and things. Exceeding these limits requires forging new modes of relating to climate in ways that reimagine the social in climatological terms. Knox contends that the day-to-day work of crafting and implementing climate policy and translating climate knowledge into the work of governance demonstrates that local responses to climate change can be scaled up to effect change on a global scale. Hannah Knox will discuss Thinking Like a Climate, with responses from Dr Pushpa Arabindoo (UCL Geography and co-director of UCL Urban Laboratory) and Professor Andrew Barry (UCL Geography and co-convenor of UCL Anthropocene). Tickets available via Eventbrite Hannah Knox is Associate Professor of Anthropology at UCL. Her books include Roads: An Anthropology of Infrastructure and Expertise (with Penny Harvey) Ethnography for a Data-Saturated World (with Dawn Nafus) and Thinking like a Climate: Governing a City in Times of Environmental Change. Pushpa Arabindoo is Associate Professor in Geography & Urban Design and also a co-director at the UCL Urban Laboratory. Her research entails ethnographic investigations of urban transformations in the Indian city of Chennai where she has been exploring a range of issues from middle-class activism to subaltern politics as they intersect with ecological imaginaries of water, waste and nature. Andrew Barry is Professor of Human Geography at UCL and co-convenor of UCL Anthropocene. He has previously written on the politics of air quality measurement, the conduct of interdisciplinary research, and the idea of Chemical Geography. His most recent book is Material Politics: Disputes along the Pipeline. Andrew taught Sociology at Goldsmiths, where he co-founded the Centre for the Study of Invention and Social Process, and was Professor of Political Geography at Oxford University, before joining UCL in 2013."

The initiative is led by the Urban Studies Institute, University of Antwerp. Over the past decade, there has been an upsurge of strategic interest in the field of urban studies in universities in Europe and beyond. Fuelled by ‘urban age’ discourses (Brenner and Schmid 2015), university leaders are considering ‘urban studies institutes’ as a must have strategic asset to position themselves in local and global networks of knowledge production. Indeed, the past decade has seen an impressive rise of interdisciplinary platforms for urban studies research at universities, more often than not with strong support and even on the instigation of university leadership. The new network therefore sets out to examine the relationship between the institutional embedding of urban studies and the orientation, nature and performativity of the research involved. The programme will (1) chart the differences and analyse the origins thereof, (2) examine the consequences of the institutional factors, and (3) identify good practices and develop scientific propositions and recommendations for policy makers. Urban Lab’s participation in the bid was led by Andrew Harris (Geography) and Clare Melhuish (Urban Lab). The network’s kick-off meeting will take place on March 22nd. The other centres participating in the network include: Brussels Centre for Urban Studies and Cosmopolis (Centre for Urban Research), Vrije Universieit Brussel; Leuven Urban Studies Institute, KU Leuven; Urban Academy, Ghent University (UGENT); EBXI, Université libre de Bruxelles; Department of Geography, Planning and International, Development, University of Amsterdam; Manchester Urban Institute, University of Manchester; Georg-Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies, Himboldt-University Berlin; ‘Cities are back in Town’ research group, Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics, CEE, Sciences Po/ CNRS; URBEUR – Urban Studies PhD Programme, University of Milan Bicocca; Institute for Urban Research, Malmö University; The Challenges of Urban Futures research platform, University of Vienna; Creativity, innovation and Urban Transformation (CRIT) research group, University of Barcelona; Metropolitan Research Institute Budapest; UCL Urban Laboratory, London; Centre for Urban Economic Development, University of Illinois at Chicago; The City institute, York University (Toronto).

Under the title Unsettling Jerusalem, the conference will examine the centrality of Jerusalem in the Palestinian political, cultural and social imaginaries. Co-Director of the Urban Lab, Prof Camillo Boano, will be contributing to the third and final session of the day titled 'Jerusalem: Present and Future - Facilitation and Commentary', introduced by Nahed Habiballah, with his talk 'Jerusalem: The Paradigm for Urban Critical Studies'. ""Through this conference, the Palestinian Museum appends the research upon which its exhibitions, Jerusalem Lives (2017) and Printed in Jerusalem (2020), were built. In pondering the topics to be addressed, we found ourselves speaking of two Jerusalems or more. One lies here: Jerusalem as manifested in the individual and collective imaginaries. Another is more distant, walled off and sealed with military checkpoints, unattainable to Palestinians living in the diaspora, the West Bank and Gaza. The conference will address the following questions: How can we read Jerusalem in the collective Palestinian imaginary? How is the centrality of Jerusalem represented in the Palestinian cultural sphere? Is there unanimity with regards to one Jerusalem? Is there one Jerusalemite voice? How does resistance mesh with the acts of ordinary daily life in the city? Does Palestinian discourse reflect the reality of Jerusalem and its features?"" Full programme is available here.

Articles will cover a range of genres across different arts and cultural practices (literature, film, music, photography, theatre, advertising, social media, radio, visual arts etc.). We invite articles that provide close analyses of cultural representations of night-time settings and narratives that stem from spatial practices at night, including, for example, night-time migrant mobilities and the implications of questions of class, race and ethnicity, gender and age in determining who can go where and when. Acknowledging the attention given to ‘urban imaginaries’ (Lefebvre, 1974) in the humanities and social sciences, this publication aims to bring the question of night-time imaginaries productively into current debates on urban spaces and migration. It will focus on nocturnal spaces as potential for or existing sites of belonging and intercultural exchange. Important cultural and social insights can be drawn from understanding how and where city spaces are experienced at night, also mindful of the impact of the current Covid-19 crisis on night-time venues and events. Thus, it seeks to understand the role of stories in giving form to and impacting on how night spaces are imagined, produced and experienced by migrant communities in Europe. Topics might include: Representation of night spaces and experiences of migration in literature and film; Migrant music-making, soundscapes and place-making at night; Migrant life-writing and (audio)-visual documenting; Migrant creative writings of the night; Virtual night spaces and migrant cultures in times of Covid-19; Narratives of gender, race, class and migration in European cities at night; Narratives of arrival, belonging, departure; Questioning migrant ‘integration’ in narratives of the night; Narratives of migrant night labour; Night spaces, crisis and regeneration among migrant communities Styleguide: see https://www.intellectbooks.com/journal-editors-and-contributors Articles should be between 6000-8000 words in length. Images must be of at least 300dpi. Images and written text should be sent in separate attachments. NB: Articles may embed audio and video recordings (these must be hosted online by the authors). Articles must be of 10Mb max and be anonymised for peer review. Include an additional file with: Title; Author name/affiliation, email; author bio-sketch 50-100 words; Orcid; abstract of 100-200 words; 6-8 keywords. Endnotes instead of footnotes.

These measures have been designed to control and restrict movement of populations across urban and rural areas, and will fundamentally alter our interactions as an academic community on and off campus during the coming year. But this is not the only global emergency in recent times to have particular implications for urbanism, generating far-reaching interventions in the ways that cities and towns are being governed, designed and managed. For years, cities in the UK and abroad have been thrown into crisis management mode as a result of floods, fires, and other hazards. Many cities around the world have taken the lead on declaring their commitment to measures designed to address human-caused climate change, alongside various forms of disaster, famine, impoverishment, environmental devastation, and racism and other forms of social marginalization and exclusion. These phenomena, closely interconnected with war, terrorism, and political conflict, have stimulated large-scale movements of displaced peoples, mass public demonstrations and violence, and a variety of further emergency management responses, resulting in the implementation of significant measures in the surveillance and control of urban space. Policing and other urban emergency services have themselves become the focus of emergency orders to facilitate intervention and control in the context of mass protests and other scenarios of urban crisis management. Such interventions, and abuses of power, have heightened debates in the public domain about citizens’ rights, racial inequities, and government authority. The aim of this year’s annual theme then is to explore the characteristics and consequences of ‘emergency urbanism’ in its different forms, and in relation to the underlying structural causes of planetary and other emergencies. When does a momentary crisis become an emergency, and what happens next? We will examine the implications of such emergencies - both in the suspension of existing consensual processes and the imposition of new constraints - and in the opportunities it offers for new ways of mobilising, operating, and innovating in the field of urban governance, design, representation, equality, and infrastructure. Working in collaboration with the UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, we will host a series of online/hybrid format talks, workshops, and activities throughout the year addressing this theme, and run a small grants scheme for project proposals from both students and staff. We look forward to engaging widely and creatively across the college and co-creating a platform for critical insights into the phenomenon of ‘emergency urbanism’ in all its variants, which reflects the vast range of experience across and beyond the UCL community as we grapple with the challenges posed by the previous and upcoming academic year.

Hosted in July 2019 and funded by the UCL East Engagement Seed Fund, the workshops were run in partnership with local community practitioners, Nicole Crockett (project coordination) and John Wallett (Livingmaps Network), on behalf of UCL Urban Laboratory. The project developed and tested two participatory mapping workshops exploring ideas around heritage, memory and the future, in the changing urban landscape of east London, specifically the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the surrounding neighbourhoods. The two workshops engaged loosely with The Groundbreakers, a heritage engagement project by Livingmaps Network, which is seeking to create two audio trails presenting the rich and varied heritage of the Park. The workshops aimed to engage local people in journeys around the Park, visiting heritage hotspots on the Groundbreakers trail, uncovering the hidden history of the site, and working together to create maps, which captured audience members experiences and responses to the area. This document, writen by Nicole Crockett, summarises the activities that took place, outlines their effectiveness and highlights issues for consideration in future UCL East and Urban Room public engagement work.

Research we have been undertaking since 2016 has provided evidence for the important role of lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer (LGBTQ+) spaces to the wellbeing of these communities and to society more widely. Camden has a long history as a borough with a large LGBTQ+ population and a variety of socially and culturally innovative scenes. It continues to be home to important spaces associated with these groups, despite notable closures of some of London’s most inclusive and community-oriented venues. This briefing note gives an overview of spaces in Camden, from 1986 to the present. It highlights some of the most innovative LGBTQ+ day-time and night-spaces and the ways in which they have served different groups. It reports on a roundtable held at Camden Council in July 2019. Challenges and potentials are outlined in relation to planning and policy, detailing work already being done in the borough and suggesting ways this can be enhanced. It offers a listing of Camden-based and city-wide LGBTQ+ services. The report has been financially supported by UCL Public Policy. Visit the report page"

Each issue addresses a theme and set of questions that have recently surfaced in urban debate, framing contemporary challenges historically, and bringing together a diversity of text and visual contributions, written in an accessible way, to address audiences who are affected by the topics raised and/or are in a position to enact change. Urban Pamphleteer #8: Skateboardings gathers together activists, artists, and educators who show nuance on the effect skateboarding can have to positively influence social and urban change. The lived experiences of skateboarders of colour, of diverse genders and sexualities, of different mobilities and class backgrounds, intersect with the politics of their everyday lives and negotiations with public and private space. With this in mind, the issue asks: What does a skateable space look and feel like, and for whom? Does skateboarding benefit from accessible urban design, and if so, why? Can skateboarders be good partners for cities? The contributions include: Find a Curb - Ted Barrow Towards Inclusive Skate Scholarship and Activism - Paul O'Connor City Mill Skate: Skateboarding, Architecture and Community - Esther Sayers and Sam Griffin To Be Read / Allowed - Kyle Beachy Towards Radical Empathy - Tommy Carroll and Luke Cianciotto Feint Lines: Notes on the Creation of a Skateboard Choreography - Dani Abulhawa Queering Skateable Space: How Dispersing Skatespots Defuses Toxic Masculinity - Tobias Coughlin-Bogue 2025: Skating the Smart City - Claire Alleaume Skateboarding and Mobility: Felipe Nunes interviewed by Ben Rubin - Felipe Nunes and Ben Rubin Crystal Palace Skatepark: Complexity and Contradiction - Iain Borden Instaposts - Jilleen Liao Skateboarding into the Sun - Kava Garcia Vasquez Can Skateboarders in Nottingham be Good Partners to the City Without Being 'Shock Troops of Gentrification'? - Chris Lawton Louisa Menke - Louisa Menke Like a Dog - Tara Jepsen Long Live Southbank - Long Live Southbank The issue was guest edited by Thomas Callan-Riley and Sander Hölsgens, with series editors Ben Campkin and Rebecca Ross, and design by Guglielmo Rossi.

35,Life Stories from Bar Elias - video produced as part of research co-conducted by DPU's Camillo Boano,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/development/news/2020/apr/life-stories-bar-elias-video-produced-part-research-co-conducted-dpus-camillo-boano,16 April 2020,"The video documentary is part of a research collaboration between the RELIEF centre and CatalyticAction. It is a visual representation of the work done in Bar Elias by lead researchers including DPU’s Prof. Camillo Boano with Joana Dabaj (CatalyticAction) and Prof. Howayda Al-Harithy (American University of Beirut). As the lockdown started because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ‘Life Stories from Bar Elias’ video documentary was ready to be shared. The team is thinking of the people in Bar Elias during these hard times, this video of them sharing their life stories brought them closer. With this global uncertainty, it is important to reflect on the meaning of home across the different contexts and as researchers and designers to respond accordingly.This film is part of a film series that aims to tell the life stories of people from the field, giving insights to the research conducted by the RELIEF centre and engaging the audience to want to learn more and get in touch with the researchers. The research looks at the practice of inhabiting and the making of an urban territory of Bar Elias. It focuses on Bar Elias’s ‘renewed urban grammar’ to use Bhan’s words (2017), where diverse community groups are living in one of the most vulnerable localities, where the ratio of refugees to deprived Lebanese is at least three to one or more (UNHCR, 2015) and highlighting a sort of becoming urban embracing the sensorium of the unfinished, the exceptional, the informal and the role of financial transactions. Based on a recent investigation, as part of a four years research project, the video aims to reflect on the becoming-urban of Bar Elias in its plurality where difference co-inhabit, where living together is not a choice but a destiny in which bodies move, dance, discard, coexist, in narrow spaces bound by the material limits of the city. The video documentary is directed by Fabio Petronilli, produced by Catalytic Action and funded by The Relief Centre. "
36,‘Stay at Home’: Housing as a pivotal infrastructure of care?,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2020/apr/stay-home-housing-pivotal-infrastructure-care,6 April 2020,"It is always difficult to write something meaningful when the categories we often adopt are not sufficient to grasp the severity and the globality of the present condition. In pandemic times, the linchpin strategy to prevent the spread of disease relies on a ‘Staying at home’ mantra of securitization and immunization. But staying home proved to be a privilege not feasible for many and social distancing impossible for the majority of urban inhabitants. This universal measure allows inequalities, vulnerabilities and structural perversions to emerge more violently. Now, more than ever, the centrality of housing and the practices of living are fundamental for population’s care and health. While many are interrogating on the future, if any, on the post-, and the surely extreme consequences at economic and political levels, the zeitgeist calls for fostering radical care. In the short piece on the DPU blog, we want to expand our understanding of the interdependent nature of housing and urbanism as well as possible directions for guiding the synergies of efforts of response and recovery. The departing point for global solidarity, we argue, needs to frame housing as the pivotal ‘infrastructure of care’ for surviving in the present and for reimaging the future of cities.

38,Watch: Urban Lab Films available to stream at home,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2020/mar/watch-urban-lab-films-available-stream-home,27 March 2020,"Since 2011, UCL Urban Laboratory has run Urban Lab Films, a public programme of screenings on cities, urbanisation and urban experience across a range of genres. Over that period we are very proud to have partnered with cinemas and other spaces across London and further afield to bring the best of urban cinema to engaged audiences. As cinemas have been forced to close in response to the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, we know this period will be difficult for them, so we wish to extend thanks to our partners, in particular Bertha DocHouse, the ICA, The Cinema Museum, and BFI, as well as the cinema exhibitors network Film Hub London. We look forward to returning to their screens and we hope you can support them once they re-open. For now, home viewing is the way, and we're pleased to share the Urban Lab Films online collection: films we have screened either as standalone features, curated evenings, or thematic series' over the past nine years. The links below are primarily for viewers in the UK, although many are relevant to those based elsewhere in the world. The list includes titles where they are available for free, as part of a subscription service, or available to rent or buy. The Street (dir. Zed Nelson, 2019)  Our most recent screening has arrived on streaming services this week. In a moment where many of us are confined to our homes, and some of us forced to slow down, it is worth reflecting on the fast-paced change that has been re-shaping our cities. Zed Nelson’s moving portrait of an area in east London being quickly transformed by luxury redevelopments and sky-high property prices is a great place to start. Available on Curzon Home Cinema and BFI Player Watch our post-screening panel on YouTube Piccadilly (dir. E. A. Dupont, 1929)  Bringing the bright lights of Piccadilly Circus and the backstreets of Limehouse to cinema screens, Piccadilly tells the sometimes glamorous and sometimes sordid tale of scullery maid Shosho (played by Chinese-American star Anna May Wong) and her fateful rise to stardom as a nightclub dancer. Directed by German émigré E. A. Dupont, and written by popular novelist Arnold Bennett, Piccadilly was hailed at the time of its production as the ‘most striking film issued recently from a British studio.’ Today, the film still stands up as a fascinating (and visually ravishing) depiction of jazz age London riven by class and racial prejudice. Screened as part of a curated evening of films - 'Nights in the Electric City' - we were honoured to have one of the UK's leading silent film pianists, Stephen Horne, accompany our showing at Omnibus Clapham. Available on BFI Player Listen to our post-screening panel on Soundcloud The Houseless Shadow (dir. William Raban, 2011)  William Raban’s film uses the text of the Charles Dickens essay Night Walks to explore continuities between London’s nocturnal life as it is today, compared with how it was observed 150 years ago. What would Dickens’s keen eye for social inequality have made of the growing numbers of houseless on the streets of this otherwise glittering cosmopolitan city? The inequalities of the urban night are laid bare in this film, and countinue to be a priority area of research for the Urban Lab. Available on BFI Player News from Home (dir. Chantal Akerman, 1976)  A meditation on urban alienation and personal and familial disconnection by the Belgian film auteur. Akerman began the project whilst sifting through letters sent by her mother Natalia in Brussels during Akerman’s initial New York stay. In this 90-minute film essay, Akerman reads her mother’s notes over 16 millimeter master shots of urban scenes. Natalia’s writing guides Akerman’s camera as she moves across city exteriors, along major and minor promenades, inside subway passages and platforms, and among the clamor of both pedestrians and cars. Available on Criterion Collection (US only) Read our screening notes (pdf) Oslo, August 31st (dir. Joachim Trier, 2011)  Another film that explores loneliness and urban experience, we were pleased to host the film's director (Trier) and writer (Eskil Vogt) for a Q&A at the ICA during the Architecture Film Festival in 2017. Based on the duration of a single day, Oslo, August 31st follows Anders, a recovering drug addict, through the city where he grew up. Intending to get his life back on track, Anders visits an old friend and goes to a job interview, recognising how the world has moved on without him. Focusing on his body, his experiences and health issues, the city is explored as small pockets of intimate spaces, forming a sensitive and final goodbye with a place and its people. Available on Amazon Prime Video and iTunes Vertical Horizons: In The Shadow of The Shard (dir. Tom Wolseley, 2017) [EXCLUSIVE]  Created as part of an artist residency at the Urban Lab, we are pleased to offer limited-time access to this meditative film on Western Europe’s tallest building. Artist filmmaker Tom Wolseley juxtaposes views of the Shard from different vantage points around south London with contrasting narratives about the building and his own response to living in its shadow. The film asks questions about the relationship between the individual and the larger global dynamics that are manifesting themselves in the changing landscapes of major cities such as London. Available on Vimeo (free, password: London) Find out more about the artist residency Find out about our Urban Verticality priority area Neighbouring Sounds (dir. Kleber Mendonça Filho, 2012)  The winds of global capitalism and economic prosperity brought about some complex clashes between modernity and a colonial culture of masters and servants in countries like Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and many other fast-growing emergent nations. Placemaking in these countries is a process marked by constant tensions in the simmering relations between the parties in an ever more complex social stratification. Upper and middle classes, working and low-income classes, dispute power and protagonism in the making of urban spaces and territories. Fear and paranoia contaminates the vision of “the other” and helps defining commonalities and separations. Neighbouring Sounds pictures this complex phenomenon through the slow building of characters and their connections to one another in an affluent neighbourhood in the city of Recife, Brazil, following the arrival of an independent private security firm. Available on MUBI and Curzon Home Cinema Listen to our Urban Laboratory lecture with Valeria Ribeiro Corossacz: 'White Middle-Class households: race, class and sex inequalities in Rio' We are also working to bring audio from our panel discussion with Anna Minton, Rodrigo Firmino and Tiago De Luca online soon  These are a selection of films we have screened that are available on streaming services, for free, to rent or to buy.

42,Study on safety in London's public spaces for women and girls released,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2020/mar/study-safety-londons-public-spaces-women-and-girls-released,6 March 2020,"This independent scoping report, produced by Dr Ellie Cosgrave, Tiffany Lam, and Zoe Henderson, and co-published by UCL Urban Laboratory and the UCL Urban Innovation and Policy Lab, offers a guide to the fundamentals of gender inclusive public space design; highlights tools for investing in gender-informed public spaces; presents examples of existing action in the capital; and lays out a set of recommendations for action. People flock to cities like London for opportunity; for work, education, culture, nightlife, and social connectedness. We know that these can be a liberation and freedom to those people who are able to access it. However, we also know that public spaces are used and experienced differently by men and women. Simply presenting as female in public space increases vulnerability to violence and this is exacerbated at certain times of night in certain locations of the city. This is especially relevant in London, where 40 per cent of sexual assaults take place in public spaces including the transport network UN Women founded the Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces programme in recognition of the discrepancy between how violence in the private domain is largely regarded as a human rights violation, yet violence against women and girls (especially sexual harassment) in public spaces remains neglected and is accepted as normal or inevitable. As a signatory to this programme, London has committed to furthering work ensuring that women and girls are empowered in public spaces and that they are free from sexual harassment and other forms of sexual violence. Among the recommendations laid out in the report is a call to re-instate the Women’s Design Service; to implement gender mainstreaming pilot projects using gender disaggregated data; to conduct night safety audits; build on existing public awareness campaigns and create positive imagery in the public realm; and to integrate a gender perspective into TfL’s Healthy Streets Approach.

43,UCL Urban Laboratory is now 100% Powered by Plants,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2020/feb/ucl-urban-laboratory-now-100-powered-plants,27 February 2020,"The campaign began when the Sustainability Champions within the Psychology of Language Division (PALS) raised the question of whether the department could provide 100% vegetarian catering across events and meetings. They felt this would enhance the health and wellbeing of staff and students and would be a positive action in face of the Climate Emergency. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which UCL researchers made significant contributions to, calls for ‘rapid and far-reaching’ transitions in policies on agriculture and dietary change. The meat and dairy industry produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions(2) and it is considered to be the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, habitat destruction and land desertification(3). If all departments switched to 100% vegetarian catering, UCL’s food emissions would be reduced by 40%, saving ~5,000 tonnesCO2 per annum, equivalent to taking 1,000 cars off the road(4). There is now compelling scientific evidence that reducing meat consumption improves health (5) and reduces the risk of some of the leading causes of death today including cardiovascular disease, some cancers, type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer(6). There are also significant health benefits to addressing climate change; twelve UCL departments contributed to the Lancet Countdown which concluded that ""tackling climate change could be the greatest opportunity for global health in the 21st century""(7). The campaign was endorsed by UCL’s Sustainability Director, Richard Jackson:"

45,Circulations of Zero Waste: Policy and planning ideas across London and Paris,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2020/feb/circulations-zero-waste-policy-and-planning-ideas-across-london-and-paris,5 February 2020,"With the rise of a global environmental change discourse, waste has emerged as a significant category in terms of framing legitimate theoretical as well as practical concerns, capturing public imagination through policy promises such as zero waste programmes. As a global movement, the idea of 'zero waste' encapsulates a wide range of notions from circular economy and recycling and recovery of resources to sustainable consumption behaviour. Policies targeting zero waste can embody any of these aspects and not necessarily all of them, leading to mostly target-driven legislative regulations that struggle often to meet these expectations. There is an urgent need to subject zero waste programmes (particularly those involving policy and planning initiatives) to a critical scrutiny if we are to avoid them being reduced to simple benchmarking exercises or evaluated based on a reductivist understanding of success or failure. This research project thus proposes to investigate zero waste programmes across London and Paris as a comparative gesture that acknowledges the specificity of their ‘waste histories’ resulting in quite different waste management trajectories, asking more broadly what they precisely tell about global cities such as London and Paris’s uneven geographies of waste production and disposal. Through your dissertation, we would like you to explore the following: How has the idea of zero waste evolved as a policy and planning objective in London and Paris? What is the socio-historical context of this knowledge and how has it been produced and circulated? How has urban governance in the two cities been set up and tailored to address the specific concerns of a zero waste programme and what kind of governance regimes emerge from this pursuit? How are zero waste programmes showcased across the Channel as innovative urban experiments to become engrained in policy and planning? While ideally we are looking for a student who is proficient in English and French demonstrating an ability to investigate zero-waste programmes in both the cities (London and Paris), we are willing to consider a proposal where you feel comfortable looking into only one city (London or Paris), provided this is well-substantiated. Please submit a short statement expressing your interest in this topic and how you think are you suited to undertake this research by 14 February 2020 to Dr Pushpa Arabindoo (p.arabindoo@ucl.ac.uk). Outline in a few lines your initial ideas on your conceptual approach as well as innovative methodological possibilities. If selected, expenses related to your dissertation research will be covered. Since funding for this project has to be claimed by 31 July 2020, you will need to submit all reimbursables by 1 July 2020 factoring in estimates of impending costs such as printing of dissertation well ahead of the September deadline. You will also be expected to participate in a zero-waste masterclass scheduled in Paris for 8/9 April 2020. The project is funded through the Paris pathway of the UCL Cities partnerships Programme, and is a collaboration between Dr Pushpa Arabindoo and Prof Eric Verdeil from Sciences Po, who will simultaneously host a masters student conducting research on this topic.

It was held at The Bartlett Real Estate Institute at Here East and at UCL Bloomsbury, and included a walk around the Olympic Park, Stratford International, and Stratford town centre areas. The workshop, supported by funding from the UCL-University of Gothenburg Centre for Critical Heritage Studies, was convened to explore the parameters for a future research project comparing the impact of university developments on their neighbourhoods in three case study sites: Roma Tre Università degli Studi in Testaccio-Ostiense, Rome; UCL East in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and surrounding boroughs; University of Gothenburg in the centre of Gothenburg at campus Nackrosen It was framed by the ongoing research collaboration in the Centre for Critical Heritage Studies (Curating the City research cluster) around the role played by universities in the construction of urban heritage narratives which drive regeneration programmes in different cities, particularly of post- industrial areas. It set out to interrogate how heritage represents both an obstacle to, and an opportunity for regeneration, and what kind of strategies can be mobilised by universities to position archaeological and urban heritage as a resource for construction of possible futures for the city in the UK/European/Scandinavian context."
51,Call for Proposals - Night Scenes roundtable,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2019/dec/call-proposals-night-scenes-roundtable,5 December 2019,"The deadline for proposals has been extended until Monday 20 January, 10.00 GMT UCL Urban Laboratory will host the roundtable as part of Night Scenes, the first conference linked to a three-year transdisciplinary research project exploring nocturnal public spaces in eight cities in the Netherlands, Ireland, UK, Germany, Denmark and Portugal. The conference will take place on 23rd and 24th April 2020 at UCL, with speakers including Dr Robert Shaw, author of The Nocturnal City, Professor Judith Walkowitz, author of Nights Out: Life in Cosmopolitan London and Dr Sukhdev Sandhu, author of Night Haunts: A Journey Through the London Night. Authorities have historically wrestled with the issue of night-time control, and the hours after dark are often still perceived as harboring threats to public order and potential criminality. However, the current policy attention to night-time urban economies, exemplified by the creation of night mayors, indicates increasing interest in the potential of cities and culture at night. The roundtable and conference will set out to explore night-time urban settings in their complexity as sites of crisis and regeneration, memory and heritage, visibility and invisibility, community solidarity and growth. Doctoral candidates and recent masters graduates who have evidence from arts and humanities disciplines to contribute to these discussions please send a proposal, using the form provided, to urbanlaboratory@ucl.ac.uk by Monday 20 January, 10.00 GMT. In order to accommodate the maximum number of presenters, presentations should be kept to maximum 10-15 minutes.

52,Caribbean School of Architecture urban study visit to London,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2019/dec/caribbean-school-architecture-urban-study-visit-london,3 December 2019,"The group of 13 students from University of Technology (UTech) Kingston, Jamaica, spent an intense fortnight conducting fieldwork and archive research in the City of London, with a view to developing a detailed urban analysis focused on the historical evolution of the Square Mile’s morphology and inhabitation since Roman times, its public spaces, and urban landmarks. Generous and invaluable input was provided by architectural historian Peter Guillery (UCL Survey of London), who led a walking tour of the City’s historic churches, with added input on post-war and contemporary development from Clare Melhuish and Jordan Rowe. Conservationist Dean Sully from the Institute of Archaeology co-ordinated a fascinating visit to the archaeological remains of the Billingsgate Roman Bath House on Lower Thames Street, hosted by Howard Benge; and Kay Richardson, IoA doctoral candidate and landscape architect for Historic England South-East Region, hosted a visit to Historic England’s offices and talk on London Bridge by London Region’s David English. The students presented work in progress at an interim crit attended by Barbara Campbell Lange (BSA) and Giorgio Talocci (DPU) before the final presentation and exhibition of work at the Jamaican High Commission which concluded their visit. We look forward to collaborating on future exchange and a return visit to Kingston by UCL students next year."

During this period, Italy and the United Kingdom experienced intense economic development, political transformation, and a radical re-organisation of urban space and built form following the war-time devastation of many towns and cities. The conference explored how, notwithstanding the two countries’ contrasting geographic and climatic conditions, levels of economic and industrial development and different social structures, British and Italian architects, urbanists and historians engaged in a meaningful exchange of ideas and influences that had a significant impact on the course of architectural history at this time, which has not previously been fully documented. Find the full conference programme on the British School at Rome website. Ciccarelli and Melhuish are co-editing an edited volume of essays by Italian, British, French and American conference participants, for publication in 2020 under the same title."

Contributors to the book, some of whom participated in workshops hosted at UCL (2016) and at University of Gothenburg (2017) dedicated to the topic, will expand the field of critical heritage studies in the urban domain, by examining the role of universities both in the construction of urban heritage discourses, and in how those discourses influence urban planning decisions or become instrumentalised as mechanisms for urban regeneration. The book proposes that universities engage in these processes in a number of ways: as producers of urban knowledge which is mobilised to intervene in planning processes; as producers of heritage practices which are implemented in development contexts in the urban realm; and as developers engaged in campus construction projects which both reference heritage discourses as a mechanism for promoting support and approval by planners and the public, and capitalise on heritage assets as a resource. Case study sites include UCL East, University of Gothenburg Campus Nackrosen, University of Lund (presented in the session by Mattias Karrholm), Roma Tre University, American University of Beirut, and the Federal University of São Paolo. The introduction to the book was followed by a powerful keynote presentation by Keri Facer, Professor of Educational and Social Futures at the University of Bristol, and Uppsala University’s third visiting Zennstrom Professor of Climate Change Leadership. Facer works on rethinking the relationship between formal educational institutions and wider society and is particularly concerned with the sorts of knowledge that may be needed to address contemporary environmental, economic, social and technological changes. Her presentation underlined the huge significance of the value systems we have constructed around our historical relationships with the world, conceived as ‘heritage’, in relation to the viability of our future existence on the planet, urgently highlighting the need for profound structural change in our relationships with the past in order to move forward into a different kind of sustainable future. ‘Learning to live with a lively planet’ points to the vital role and responsibility which universities have, as producers of specific kinds of knowledge and value systems, in making this shift and realising a fundamental change in our relationship with the world Watch Professor Keri Facer’s inaugural lecture"

61,Urban Verticality Photo Competition - winner announced,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2019/aug/urban-verticality-photo-competition-winner-announced,16 August 2019,"Our inaugural photography competition was open to entries from UCL staff and students on the theme of ‘urban verticality’. As one of our Priority Areas, this theme responds to an increasing questioning of the flat and horizontal ways cities have historically tended to be represented and understood. Of his winning entry, Macfarlane said, 'With a constrained geography and a lack of space, Hong Kong has long been the archetypal vertical city. In the northern section of Kowloon, away from the main tourist sights and across the bay from Hong Kong Island, the comparatively low-rise though densely populated district of Sham Shui Po contrasts with the newer high-rises that have sprung up around it, as across the rest of the city.' The judging panel comprised of Dr Andrew Harris (Co-Director, UCL Urban Laboratory), Dr Clare Melhuish (Director, UCL Urban Laboratory), Prof Jose Torero Cullen (Head of Department, UCL Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering), and Sidra Ahmed (PhD student, UCL Geography). Second place went to Talia Clarick from the Department of Geography, for her photo of ""The Bridge Apartments"" in New York City, which sit directly atop the busy Trans-Manhattan Expressway. The judges commented that the photo 'disables the viewer from establishing the full magnitude of the building, yet the visible floors and the dimensions of the windows provide a sense of the enormity of the structure. The traffic light on amber opens the question of how adequate a building of this nature is, whilst leaving it to the viewer to decide.' Third place was awarded to Jonah Rudlin of The Bartlett Development Planning Unit. Their photo is a record of a multi-storey conversation between the residents of an apartment block in Templehof, Berlin. 'Only a small minority of the submissions we recieved showed or implied any kind of social activity', said the judging panel. 'We really like the more ordinary qualities of the vertical scene here and the social interactions between above and below, all counterbalanced by the presence of the satellite dishes pointing as if dismissively away and hinting at more international realms of vertical connection.' The winner recieves a £100 prize. Below is a gallery of the runner-up entries. A number of other submissions to the competition are available to view in our Flickr album."

During their time at UCL, Creative Fellows will work towards the development of an original piece of work which draws directly on their interactions with researchers and students. Nicola Baldwin, a former UCL English alumna, will be based jointly in the UCL Urban Laboratory and UCL Institute of Advanced Studies, working with Dr Pushpa Arabindoo on the project City Dionysia: Narrating Wasteland in Urban Life. Invoking the ancient Greek practice of CITY DIONYSIA where plays fuelled public debate, Baldwin will explore how twenty-first century theatre can create new audiences for academic research, promoting creative inquiry into urban problems. Using as a testbed Pushpa’s priority area of ‘Wasteland’ at UCL Urban Laboratory and the collaborative annual theme of ‘Waste’ at the IAS and Urban Lab, Nicola will consider how these concerns of contemporary urban life might be apprehended, and how its socio-material aspects performed. During the Creative Fellowship, Nicola will develop a new play, tentatively titled Wasteland, challenging her own creative technique through collaboration with students on the MSc Urban Studies programme and wider UCL community, and by drawing on Pushpa’s unique pedagogical insights, combining theory and practice to rethink her approach to theatre as a curatorial exercise. Exploring political practices of urban activism as forms of theatricality that can display, dramatise, and more than symbolically address a theme, Nicola will focus on creating an urban performativity that, through an interactive dramaturgical approach, offers new ideas about the role of theatre in society, and representation of WASTELAND as a liminal space. UCL Urban Laboratory will present a staged reading of Baldwin’s new play We The Young Strong at the Bloomsbury Theatre on Thursday 24 October. Image credit: Rabbit Hole Photography"

Find out more here. We are inviting papers which draw on original research and scholarship to explore aspects of urbanisation, urban practices and approaches to generating knowledge about global urbanisms from any context, but particularly those which expand understandings of urbanisation and urban experience from Latin American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Eastern European and African perspectives, and those which generate dialogue across disciplinary and methodological borders. We also welcome more practice-based contributions which critically engage with the ambition to develop global urban knowledge across the diversity of urban experiences in relation to sustainable development goals, for example; or which seek to build insights into urban experiences through grounded collaborative and community-led or design-based research and practice. The panels will be composed to provide scope for researchers to engage across the wide field of urban studies and related disciplines, and to share knowledge on similar issues across different regional contexts, and from different analytical and disciplinary approaches. The conference will make use of a range of formats (round tables, inter-panel report backs) to stimulate collegial exchanges across different geographical and disciplinary perspectives. We strongly encourage scholars based in the global South to propose papers, and we will explore opportunities for co-funding attendance and fee waivers. Also, scholars from the global South based in the UK or Europe at the time of the conference are strongly encouraged to apply to attend, and to explore co-funding where possible. The conference will be organised according to three broad thematics: Reshaping urban spaces, Remaking urban experiences, Redefining urban futures.

The overlay of images gives a painterly effect to the composition as if through the dense and humid air, the masses of buildings gradually dematerialise in the glowing light of Venice’s hazy and cold autumn days. Absence means to be away. It represents the city of Venice as a place that remains away from our grasp, so we can recreate it through our memory and imagination. Dr Felipe Lanuza Rilling is a practicing architect, educator, and postdoctoral researcher at the UCL Urban Laboratory. His current research expands and deepens the interpretative framework and design methods developed in his PhD by investigating and representing the multiple and layered dimensions of absence as can be found in the changing environment of Burgess Park and the neighbouring Aylesbury Estate in south London. Opened in February 2019, permanent displays of public art in the Student Centre include a new sculpture by UCL alumna and Turner Prize winner Rachel Whiteread and an innovative digital art installation by multidisciplinary art duo Thomson & Craighead (Jon Thomson is a member of staff from UCL's Slade School of Fine Art). The Student Centre is the new heart of UCL's Bloomsbury campus, providing 1,000 additional study spaces and enhancing the student experience. The centre is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every single day of the year. Access to all areas of the building apart from the public atrium requires a UCL staff or current student ID card."

Camden has a long history as a borough with a large LGBTQ+ population and continues to be home to many important spaces, despite some notable venue closures. The project will highlight a selection of the most innovative LGBTQ+ day-time and night-spaces and the ways in which they have served different groups, including by reducing social isolation and loneliness. Case studies will also highlight how Camden Council, and bodies such as Camden LGBT Forum and LGBTQ+ campaign groups have worked together, with a view to understanding how these relationships could be nurtured. The project will result in the publication of a briefing note detailing the research findings and recommendations, which will also be presented at a roundtable event with Camden Council and local stakeholders. Since 2016 Professor Ben Campkin and Lo Marshall have been researching LGBTQ+ nightlife in London since 1986. Reports from the project released evidenced a 58% decline in the capital’s LGBTQ+ venues since 2006, demonstrating factors behind these closures, as well as the impact of closure upon LGBTQ+ Londoners.

74,"Urban sound, performance and transnational identities - Call for Participants",https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2019/feb/urban-sound-performance-and-transnational-identities-call-participants,27 February 2019,"We contend that performance forges ties between communities dispersed across historic transnational networks, and creates shared urban histories and heritage between cities. In so doing, and drawing on a Critical Heritage Studies approach, the event will re-examine the relationship between 'metropole' and 'periphery', highlighting some of the ways in which patterns of postcolonial migration and mobility have re-shaped the urban landscapes and identity of 'the centre' in the image of 'the edge', and embedded those counter-narratives at the heart of our urban culture. Confirmed speakers during the day include Sonjah Stanley Niaah (University of the West Indies), Mykaell Riley (University of Westminster), Joy White (sociologist and ethnographer), Julian Henriques (Goldsmiths, University of London), and Richard Bramwell (Loughborough University). The PhD roundtable session on the afternoon of 17 May invites six current PhD candidates exploring cultures, geographies, practices, histories, and theories of music and the city to examine - through collaborative discussion - questions and provocations formed by their own abstract submissions, led by the chair. The purpose of this roundtable is to discuss multiple cases and comparative approaches to understanding the relationship that music has to the city as socio-cultural, economic, historical, and political object/agent in the context of the 6 participants' research. Please send abstracts (up to 300 words) outlining your current research topics and interests to Peter Sach (ucfapha@ucl.ac.uk) by Wednesday 24th April. Submissions are welcome from all disciplines, and at all stages of PhD research. Financial assistance is available to help cover the costs of travel and accommodation for participants. Please state your requirements when submitting your abstract. Following the day's roundtable and panel discussions, Cities Imaginaries will close with an evening of performance and discussion in the newly-refurbished, 550 seat capacity Bloomsbury Theatre. Organisers are accepting submissions from musicians to participate and perform; discussing their musical influences, inspirations, and approaches to creating and performing music in relation to this year's themes of transnational identities, mobility and migration. Artists will be chosen to perform some repertoire live, and to discuss the above between themselves and a panel chair. Please send a 250 word abstract which discusses your performance and production in relation to this year's theme, along with your technical requirements/rider, to Jordan Rowe (urbanlaboratory@ucl.ac.uk) by Sunday 17 March. If possible, please send links for any accompanying audio or video, or alternatively you can drop off files via UCL Dropbox to the email address listed above. This is an open call, and PhD candidates who are already applying to the roundtable are encouraged to apply to this also, if their work involves performance and production of music. A performance fee is available to each chosen participant. The day forms part of UCL Culture's Performance Lab, a season where artists, researchers and students explore how live performance can animate research - and how research can inspire art. The event is also part of Bartlett 100, a year-long celebration to mark 100 years since the naming of UCL's global faculty of the Built Environment."

76,Call for Papers: Historical Perspectives on Urban Infrastructures,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2019/feb/call-papers-historical-perspectives-urban-infrastructures,11 February 2019,"Please find below more details about the background; workshops aims; expected outcomes for participants; and funding. BackgroundThe term 'infrastructure' is now so commonly used it is often taken for granted, both in everyday English and academic literature. Yet, the origins of this fairly 'young' word - which took its present meaning in English in 1951 (Carse, 2017) - are full of interrogations: its etymology, the politics of its emergence, the professional networks that embraced it, the social imagination (Picon, 2018) emerging from and attached to it, remain understudied and would benefit from a sharper intellectual critique. Infrastructure generally describes the basic physical and organization structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise, according to the Oxford Dictionary. This definition, both generous and fuzzy, captures the richness of a concept that has so vividly stroke a chord in our collective imagination. The vastness of the concept of 'infrastructure' is such that for Harvey et al. ""a definitive definition remains elusive"" and even more: ""the aspiration to unequivocal specification can be seen as itself conceptually and empirically counter-productive"" (2017: 5). Indeed, in the last twenty years or so, social science has engaged critically with the concept thanks to key works such as Latour (1993), Star (1999), Graham and Marvin (2001) by studying infrastructure as complex networks formed of interrelations between social practices and inanimate ""things"". Contrasting with western centric and modernist urban visions of seamless infrastructural developments, critical scholarship has emphasised the importance of interruptions, maintenance and repair as key characteristics of urban infrastructure networks in much of the world (e.g. Coutard and Rutherford, 2016, Alda-Vidal, 2018, Baptista, 2019). A wealth of ethnographic and transdisciplinary works -such as Amin (2014), Hall et al. (2017), Björkman and Harris (2018) to mention but a few- have also expanded on the notion of ""people as infrastructure"" (Simone, 2004). Workshop AimsThis workshop seeks to reflect on the historical developments that have underpinned the mutation of different 'infrastructural imagination' mobilised to make sense of urban life (past, present and future) and to inform spatial practices. We invite contributions exploring the follow questions Which professional and social networks have shaped the meaning and imaginaries attached to the notion of 'infrastructure' and its relationship with the constitution of cities? How has the term evolved through time to characterise different aspects and visions of urban modernity in cities? (This includes reflexions on the mobilisation of term infrastructure in the development of futuristic urban visions) Can we develop around the critical study of urban infrastructure new transdisciplinary methodologies that engage with social science, engineering, literature, planning and urban studies for an enhanced understanding of urbanism? Participants are invited to present works that reflects on these themes from different geographical vantage points and adopting a historical perspective. Expected outcomes for participantsThe workshop will run over half/one day (depending on popularity). The expected outcomes for participants are Multi- and transdisciplinary conversation on urban infrastructures mobilising social science, engineering, literature, planning and urban studies; An opportunity for participant to receive feedback from their peers on papers and ongoing research in an informal, yet intellectually demanding, environment; Connecting with early-career researchers across UCL faculties, University of London, and if funding allows: universities across the UK and Europe. Submitting your abstractIf you are interested in taking part, send your abstract to the workshop organisers by the extended deadline of 7 March 2019: Justinien Tribillon (Bartlett School of Planning, j.tribillon@ucl.ac.uk); Enora Robin (UCL STEaPP, enora.robin.15@ucl.ac.uk) Due to room capacity, the workshop will only be able to accommodate 20 participants. Selected abstracts will be notified early March. FundingUCL Urban Laboratory is offering five travel bursaries for non-London participants who cannot secure financial support from their host institution.

On April 14, a temporary assembly of activists, artists and interdisciplinary academics drifted together through the City of London to explore the intersections of finance and the imagination in the historic district of English (and global) wealth and power. With over 15 presentations on topics ranging from algorithms to architecture, from colonial legacies to anarchist histories, from yoga to children's play, this event sought to understand the speculative powers at work both for and against financialization. Devised in honour of the late theorist of the radical imagination Cornelius Castoriadis, each stop on the tour took the form of a 15-minute informal presentation. Later in the afternoon, the attendees retired to University College London for a panel of artists and critics responding to financialization and a closing conversation. This event was organized by organized by Dr. Aris Komporozos-Athanasiou, Assistant Professor of Social Theory at University College London and Dr. Max Haiven, Canada Research Chair in Culture, Media and Social Justice at Lakehead University in Canada.

82,Call for Papers: The Idea of the Public in Asia,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2018/oct/call-papers-idea-public-asia,5 October 2018,"Led by Dr Pushpa Arabindoo (Co-Director, UCL Urban Laboratory) and Dr Aurelie Varrel (French National Centre for Scientific Research), we invite expressions of interest for the below panel proposed at the International Convention of Asia Scholars (ICAS 11) Conference in Leiden, 16-19 July 2019. Deadline for submission of abstracts is 8 October 2018. Abstract The idea of the public emerged from a European history to launch modernity and evolved (mainly through colonialism) into a global experience, successfully turning into a more or less universalist paradigm framing discussions on citizenship, civil society and the state. In Asia, in particular, despite the fact that it is a culturally peculiar notion caught in the specific history of Europe, the idea of thepublic went beyond a European master narrative to become a modality of social life and indicates an arena in which modernity became a diversely appropriated experience. Its endurance through thedynamics of colonialism and postcolonialism suggests its continued significance in underwriting not only the norms of Asian social worlds but also rewriting its histories. While the idea of the public has equipped itself well in the face of criticism, responding to questions of race, class, gender, or even democratic practices by revealing newer sub-categories such as subaltern, plebeian, feminist, black or counter public spheres, there are concerns over the way it fits itself into the intricate and contested histories of Asia, risking preconceptions of a complex region. This has been reinforced by recent debates about theorising from the South as a result of which scholars such as Santos (2012) have openly asked if the global South needs the concept of public sphere, dismissing its theoretical and cultural propositions as entirely European. And yet, those seeking a fuller sense of the genealogy of thepublic in Asia (Scott and Ingram 2015) maintain that it is not a totalising European reality invested as it is with multiple meanings. It is in this context that we need to be careful in responding to calls for a new analytical vocabulary to make sense of the major forms of collectivity in Asia, one that would be more appropriate and may not derive from the idea of the public. The objective of this panel is to revisit the idea of the public in Asia, asking whether we need to revise it or, more drastically, completely reject it. To do so, it considers Asia as the site of provincialisation ofthe public and invites papers that explore the myriad ways in which the public has been Asianised. We are looking for contributors who not only explore novel ways in which the idea of the public has been theorised from Asia but also its prospects As an empirical object ranging from public spaces, print and other media, religion as well as interactions with the state. As a comparative project across multiple Asias (be it authoritarian/democratic, illiberal/liberal, emerging/new, etc.). As a means of bringing a different (Asianised) public back to Europe, through movement ofpeople and circulation of ideas. We welcome submissions from all disciplines including historians who have explored the historiography of the public challenging the tight categorisations built around colonialism (pre and post), as well as those from the literary and cultural studies who closely investigate the language of the public as integral to its conceptual vocabulary, besides sociologists, geographers, political scientists, anthropologists, architects and planners.

It considers the changing framework of planning and community development legislation at a number of definitive moments, such as the publication of the County of London Plan (1943), the dissolution of the Greater London Council in 1986, the establishment of the Greater London Authority and Mayor of London in 2000, and the latest Draft London Plan published by Sadiq Khan in 2017. The module draws on ethnographic, literary and visual sources to analyse key changes in the built environment in relation to the cultural representation of minority social groups. It will augment understandings of the significance of 'subaltern' community identities, ethnicities, cultural practices and intangible heritage in the formation of particular London neighbourhoods and built landscapes during this period, positioning the city's global histories and diversity as central to a critical understanding of its urban heritage and futures. The module asks students to engage critically with questions such as: how do we assess urban heritage as a social, cultural and economic asset for urban development in complex multicultural/postcolonial cities (UNESCO 2011)? Participants engage with key debates in the history and theory of urban change in relation to theories of identity, critical heritage, and equalities. Participants engage with key debates in the history and theory of urban change in relation to theories of identity, critical heritage, and equalities. Part 1 focuses on historical, theoretical and methodological contexts (15 credits) and Parts 1+2 (30 credits) also includes fieldwork at an identified London site and/or archive and production of an appropriate project output. The course is administered as part of the Architecture and Historic Urban Environments MA at the Bartlett School of Architecture. Students from other postgraduate courses are encouraged to apply, and it is particularly suitable for those taking MA, MSc or MRes courses in Architectural History, Architectural Design, Urban Design, Urban Studies, Material and Visual Culture, Art History, Architecture and Digital Theory, Situated Practice, and Built Heritage Management (IoA). For further information about the course, please contact Ben Campkin or Clare Melhuish.

84,Urban Laboratory Lecture Series Autumn 2018,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2018/sep/urban-laboratory-lecture-series-autumn-2018,17 September 2018,"The term 'urban laboratory' has been extensively applied in urban innovation discourse and, by extension, has acquired currency in urban studies. In its broadest sense it indicates an alignment of research scholarship and policy development orientated towards innovation, change and improvement in urban conditions and economies, and further implies a mobilisation of partnerships and networks across different sectors and urban actors (academia, civic society, community, industry, government). However today's emphasis on the city as a technical and policy-driven milieu, framed by discourses of 'smart' experimentation and innovation, sometimes seems to overlook the phenomenological, embodied, and imaginary dimensions of human experience and interaction in cities, and the complex adaptive and inventive strategies which urban populations mobilise to ensure survival in dense, competitive urban scenarios. This series of lectures is therefore designed to explore the synergies between science and arts-based research, experimentation, and theorisation in order to revisit the urban laboratory agenda and think through its implications in relation to different spatial and temporal contexts and cultures. It will further bring to the fore a focus on the theme of urban identities and heritage for the UCL Urban Laboratory during the 2018-19 academic year, highlighting a range of methodological approaches to research across this field and analysis of its relevance to questions of infrastructure, spatial justice, and livelihoods in the city. All lectures are free and open to the public without the need to book. They take place fortnightly on Tuesdays during the autumn, from 18.30 in Room G03 at 26 Bedford Way."

The review, by MSc students Jordan Rowe, Olivia Smith and Sidra Ahmed, with the module and course convenor Dr Andrew Harris, argues that, while there are deeper analyses of deepening inequality in cities, Florida's book offers an entry point to the subject for non-academic readers by tying together the central elements and contradictions of contemporary neoliberal governance. The Urban Studies MSc is administered through the UCL Geography department, and is closely connected with the UCL Urban Laboratory to draw out its interdisciplinary approach, intellectual engagement and international scope.

86,Unmoored Cities: what speculative futures exist for cities in the face of climate change?,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2018/aug/unmoored-cities-what-speculative-futures-exist-cities-face-climate-change,15 August 2018,"Indeed, many of the world's cities are at risk of becoming 'unmoored', whether literally sunk beneath rising sea waters or tidal rivers or forced to relocate entirely. Such possible urban futures challenge our imaginations to think through the physical, social and cultural consequences of climate change; yet, on the whole, the current literature on climate change and cities focuses on the mitigation of rather than adaption to those consequences. Following on from our one-day symposium hosted in May 2018 - Unmoored Cities: Radical Urban Futures and Climate Catastrophes - researcher Paul Dobraszczyk reports on our Medium blog from the talks which aimed to challenge and expand the narrow range of possibilities that currently characterise approaches to the subject through imaginative modes of thinking.

Each issue addresses a theme and set of questions that have recently surfaced in urban debate, across public, academic, professional, policy, activist, artistic and other communities. The series sets out to frame contemporary challenges historically, and to bring together a diversity of text and visual contributions, written in an accessible way, to address audiences who are affected by the topics raised and are in a position to enact change. Urban Pamphleteer #7: LGBTQ+ Night-time Spaces: Past, Present & Future features a variety of examples that together suggest how and why different night-time venues, events and clusters are produced; how, when and why they have opened or closed; the scenes that have recently emerged, or are imagined, and how these connect with historical ones, and with other places. UCL Urban Laboratory's recent research evidenced that 58% of LGBTQ+ licensed venues in London closed in the past decade. Although it also highlighted how LGBTQ+ communities are queering non-LGBTQ+- specific venues, this should be seen against a wider trend of closures of pubs, nightclubs and grassroots music venues in London. Notwithstanding these challenges, some newer LGBTQ+ spaces and events are evident and these are providing spaces for communities traditionally less well served. Institutions such as cinemas, galleries and museums are also increasingly hosting LGBTQ+ nighttime events. Yet established forms of night-space, and the functions they serve, cannot simply be replaced by new or virtual ones. Strong campaigns have mobilised to protect and re-open well established venues that while demonstrably viable and valued have recently closed. Activists have documented the impacts on specific communities when vital spaces have been shut in the interests of more profitable or larger-scale development. The Mayor of London and Night Czar have recognised this evidence and recently launched an LGBT+ Venues Charter, featured in the Urban Pamphleteer issue. Other contributors address how LGBTQ+ people experience the city at night; which nightlife spaces are valued and why; the tactics being used to claim or reclaim space by and for members of communities with less access to permanent, licensed venues; whether certain kinds of space are more difficult to queer than others; and what can be done to support LGBTQ+ night scenes and spaces now and into the future. Urban Pamphleteer #7 was officially launched on Saturday 14 July at a public reception hosted at the Museum of London, featuring an open mic session with brief talks by people involved in creating and campaigning for a range of long-running, new and imagined LGBTQ+ community spaces. This issue was edited by Ben Campkin, Laura Marshall, and Rebecca Ross, and designed by Guglielmo Rossi. Contributors include: Stuart Feather; DJ Ritu; Anton Johnson; Ben Walters; Chardine Taylor-Stone; Joe Parslow; Victoria Sin; Travis Alabanza; R. Justin Hunt; Josh Hepple; Planning Out; Friends of the Joiners Arms; Queer Spaces Network. The cover features documentation of work by artist Prem Sahib.

UCL was named as one of the UK's best employers for lesbian, gay, bi and trans staff in the Index published earlier this year, ranking 98th out of 434 participating organisations. Although the Stonewall Workplace Index mainly focusses on employment issues, additional material is submitted by organisations to highlight community collaboration, outreach and engagement. UCL Urban Laboratory's ongoing research on the nightlife spaces important to London's LGBTQ communities was highlighted in the university's submission to Stonewall and made a significant contribution to the section score, with feedback pointing out the strength of our research collaboration with LGBTQ+ community groups Raze Collective and the Queer Spaces Network. UCL's Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Office said: ""The Urban Lab research is a great example of UCL collaborating with other organisations to promote LGBTQ+ equality which deliver real impact."" UCL Urban Laboratory has also acted as a close partner in the setting up of a cross-institution LGBTQ, gender and sexuality studies research network, qUCL, which was launched with a joint event in 2014 - the Queer Zoo. The Stonewall Top 100 Employers are the best performing employers on Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index 2018, an annual audit of workplace culture for lesbian, gay, bi and trans staff. The Workplace Equality Index is free to enter for any employer. UCL Urban Laboratory will launch a new edition of its Urban Pamphleteer series on 14 July 2018, with the issue gathering a number of perspectives, provocations and vignettes on London's LGBTQ+ night-time spaces, past, present and future, with a focus on the different tactics being used to queer night-space.

The essay, 'Queer, New Urban Agendas', outlines some of the most pressing threats to queer spaces across London. Gentrification and displacement pressure local nightlife institutions in particular, but reverberate to spaces well beyond London's bars and clubs, including large-scale infrastructure networks and local community centers. Campkin outlines some of the designs, programmes, and campaigns seeking to address these challenges, organised collaboratively between planners, practitioners, activists, and government officials. In a global political climate with growing movements of socially conservative populism where it's clearer than ever that LGBTQ+ rights are under threat, London can provide one case study of attempts to push back.

At the UCL Urban Laboratory, Olusoga offered a thought-provoking historical journey through periods of housing crisis in the UK - contending that the problem is hard-wired into our cities. He questioned whether today's levels of housing inequality and poverty may even eclipse that seen in the past. Usually careful not to band around terms such as 'Victorian' or 'Dickensian', Olusoga made a point of mentioning that a comparison between our current situation and the Victorian era would be unfair, as we're now at a point which is worse than that. As one of the first majority urban countries in the world, the UK paid the price for being at the forefront of industrialisation and urbanisation. Living conditions in the rapidly growing cities of Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool shocked international visitors. Significant government action was only taken once the consequences for the population's health were laid bare. As the military began recruiting for the Boer War and WW1, they found that the poor physical condition of the young men signing up - from deformed chests to stunted growth - had serious implications for national security. In 1919 David Lloyd George promised 'homes fit for heroes' to soldiers returning from the war, acknowledging a national responsibility to address the acute shortage of decent housing. Following WWII, the new government launched the largest public house building programme in history under the auspices of local councils, framed by the post-war consensus supporting a welfare state. The collapse of this social consensus has led us down a path to shocking housing inequalities, not just between rich and poor, but intergenerationally too, as young people part with large portions of their salary to cover rent costs, whilst home ownership has become far from the norm. Olusoga doubted that any contemporary politicians have the answers, vision or strategy to deal with the situation. Taking the raft of unaffordable 'affordable housing' being advertised across the UK, which can often sell for more than nine times average earnings for the area, Olusoga said the situation was even 'Orwellian'. Ending the lecture with a call for political action, especially among the millennial generation who have lost out so greatly, David said that the post-war portal to home ownership had gone: 'we are on the edge of a social disaster delivered through housing poverty, and anger has got to be the answer'. Cities Imaginaries is UCL Urban Laboratory's activity strand encompassing the curation and creation of cultural representations of cities and urban life. Led by Urban Lab Co-Director and Professor of Nineteenth-Century Literature, Matthew Beaumont, previous annual lectures have been delivered by high-profile cultural figures, including Urvashi Butalia (watch a video of the lecture), Linton Kwesi Johnson and Amit Chaudhuri. Next year, Cities Imaginaries will host a series of events on Caribbean music and cities, including a lecture with dancehall expert Sonjah Stanley Niaah.

Speaking of her appointment, Dr Melhuish said: ""I am delighted to be taking on the leadership at a very exciting time for the Urban Laboratory. I look forward to extending our influence and impact as a platform for innovative urban research methods, generating new empirical and theoretical knowledge about processes of urban transformation and their impact on communities, and forging strong and productive partnerships with external organisations nationally and internationally. She added: ""Our work across the arts, humanities and sciences has made a major contribution to modelling new modes of transdisciplinary research and teaching, engaging with communities, professionals, and businesses for the future."" Professor Alan Penn, Dean of the Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, welcomed the appointment, ""I look forward to working with Clare to embed the Urban Lab firmly in UCL East, the university's new campus in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which is based around the ideas of cross faculty and transdisciplinary working and community engagement that Matthew Gandy and Ben Campkin have developed so effectively."" Dr Melhuish has a multidisciplinary background in architectural history and criticism, anthropology and human geography and has been a Co-Director and Senior Research Associate at UCL Urban Laboratory for four years. Her work uses anthropological research methods and theoretical perspectives to understand architectural and urban development processes, and their impacts on social life, in postcolonial cities shaped by hybrid cultural identities and heritage. Since joining the Urban Laboratory she has played a significant role in developing its international profile through her comparative research on university-led regeneration, linked to UCL East, the university's new campus development. She was instrumental in establishing the urban heritage research cluster - Curating the City - in the UCL and University of Gothenburg Centre for Critical Heritage Studies - initiatives that have helped cement cross-faculty links. Prior to joining UCL, Dr Melhuish worked on research projects in the Geography departments of The Open University, Queen Mary University of London, and King's College London, and published widely as an architecture critic, author and curator.

Guided by the principle that 'edge' is an area that sits between the known or privileged and the unknown or ignored, the series brought together practitioners and thinkers to consider creative place-making, arts-led urbanism and the use of interstitial spaces, across three locations that can be understood through historic, contemporary and emerging debates on edge - Bloomsbury/King's Cross, Hackney Wick, and Folkestone. In the Essays section, Dr Ben Campkin and Laura Marshall write an essay highlighting our research last year which confirmed more than half of LGBTQ+ venues in London have closed since 2006. The findings illuminate the distinctive diversity of the capital's LGBTQ+ nightlife and the important contributions that venues make to neighbourhoods and community life, wellbeing, culture and the night-time economy (read: 'Night vision'). Dr Clare Melhuish also contributes to Review with a co-authored essay with The Bartlett's Professor Alexi Marmot that considers how educational environments are integral to effective learning and safe, healthy, and sustainable cities. It comes as The Bartlett sets up a new Global Centre for Learning Environments, which will consider the spatial and design issues linked to the provision of education (read: 'Space for education').

101,Reorienting the Euro-centric bias in planning and urban studies,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/nov/reorienting-euro-centric-bias-planning-and-urban-studies,30 November 2017,"Urban Salon hosted the launch of the new edited collection Urban Geopolitics: Rethinking Planning in Contested Cities on 20 November at UCL. Edited by Jonathan Rokem (UCL Geography) and Camillo Boano (The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, UCL / Urban Lab), the book moves away from loosely defined urban theories and contexts, and argues it is time to start learning from and compare across different 'contested cities'. Frequently, comparative research in urban studies is based on similar case studies on a few selected cities in America and Europe and all too often focus on the abstract city level with marginal attention given to particular local contexts. This book questions the long-standing Euro-centric academic knowledge production by bringing together a diverse range of international case studies from Latin America, South and South East Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East, with in-depth studies of the worldwide contested nature of cities. A blog by Audrey Robeson (UCL Urban Studies MSc student) highlighting the discussions at the launch has been published on UCL's Events blog. Audio from the event is also available to listen to via the UCL Urban Laboratory's SoundCloud page. The book launch was hosted by the Urban Salon, with the financial support of UCL Urban Laboratory and The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, UCL.

So what does its future hold (and the future for other places on the 'edge' internationally) as attention focuses on creative-led regeneration processes. A re-engagement with the history, and inclusive debates about their future are key. Irene Manzini Ceinar, an MRes Interdisciplinary Urban Design student at UCL's Bartlett School of Planning, attended our recent one-day Border symposium hosted in the town, and has written an article on our Medium page highlighting the key contributions and offering some reflections of the day. Border (4 November 2017) was part of a series of events on situated practice and critical and creative placemaking, UCL Urban Laboratory hosted in the autumn of 2017 with the Folkestone Triennial arts festival. Two other events in the series were also held: Gateway, at UCL's Bloomsbury campus (14 September 2017) and Periphery, at Here East on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (7 October 2017).

103,Call for Papers: Making Southern Urban Policies,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/nov/call-papers-making-southern-urban-policies,13 November 2017,"As part of the International Conference on Policy Diffusion and Development Cooperation in São Paulo, Brazil between 16-19 May 2018, UCL Urban Laboratory is a partner for the panel session Making Southern Urban Policies: International Agendas, Transnational Networks and National Programmes. Extended submission deadline: 22 November 2017 Conveners Roberta Sakai (King's College London) Gabriela De Brelàz (Federal University of São Paulo - Unifesp) Abigail Friendly (Utrecht University) Description Debates on how the making of cities is influenced by the circulation of ideas and practices have contributed to the consolidation of policy diffusion as an analytical perspective in urban studies (Baker, Temenos, 2015; McCann, Ward, 2011; Robinson, 2011; Healey, Upton, 2010). This has led to the emergence, in different disciplines, of research concerned with the way cities in the so-called Global South have worked as sources of policy models around the world (e.g. Porto de Oliveira, 2016; Peck, Theodore, 2015; Healey, 2012). However, the major concentration on the analysis of Porto Alegre's participatory budgeting disregards how the interaction between different levels of governance has fostered the international diffusion of a variety of southern ideas and practices in the last years. In this sense, this session encourages contributions that interrogate both the influence of southern experts and institutions in the global arena and the engagement of developing countries and cities with the diffusion of certain concepts of urban development. We look forward to receiving papers that focus on the following issues: How have ideas and practices (e.g. right to the city, urban agriculture, smart cities, social housing, slum upgrading, bus rapid transit) been mobilised and translated into policies in different contexts? What has been the role of South-South cooperation, paradiplomacy and city networks (e.g. UCLG, Metropolis and Mercociudades) in the promotion of southern experiences? How has the knowledge exchange between countries produced similar national policies in developing countries (e.g. housing policy, participatory urban planning)? How have international organisations (e.g. UN-Habitat, Cities Alliance, World Bank, UCLG) engaged with the valorisation of southern knowledge in the last years? How has Habitat III and other regional and global fora (e.g. World Urban Forum, Africities, IBSA) been able to strengthen the connections between southern institutions? Contributions that consider similar questions not listed above are of course welcome. Learn about the submission rules and send your work by creating an account here. References Baker, T. and C.

In this context, the growing popularity of Lavani 'banner shows' in India's cities - especially Mumbai -  is worth critically exploring. As part of UCL's India Voices season, UCL Urban Laboratory hosted Mumbai-based filmmaker and writer Savitri Medhatul and Bhushan Korgaonkar for a one-week festival celebrating and exploring Lavani, organised by Dr Andrew Harris (UCL Geography / UCL Urban Laboratory).

109,"London LGBTQ+ venues have more than halved in past decade, Urban Lab report shows",https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/jul/london-lgbtq-venues-have-more-halved-past-decade-urban-lab-report-shows,6 July 2017,"The number of LGBTQ+ venues in London has fallen by 58% from 125 to 53 since 2006, according to a new report published today by the UCL Urban Laboratory, and commissioned by the Mayor of London and Greater London Authority (GLA). Despite LGBTQ+ venues often being thriving and successful businesses, today's study shows that they are closing because of external pressures. These include the negative impacts of large-scale developments on venue clusters, a lack of implementation of safeguarding measures in the existing planning system and the sale and change of use of property by landlords whereby venue owners, operators and clients have severely limited negotiating power compared with large organisations. Other major drivers of closure include rising business rates and rents, as well as a change of ownership, which can sometimes lead to venues becoming targeted at non-LGBTQ+ clientele. The study, conducted by Dr Ben Campkin and Laura Marshall, has produced a dataset that is to be launched as a public map by the GLA. Dr Ben Campkin (Director, UCL Urban Laboratory) said, ""Our research evidences the rich variety of LGBTQ+ night-time venues in London and the continuing need for these spaces, which serve an important range of functions for neighbourhood and community life, culture and wellbeing. ""Over the period of the study, a large number of venues have succumbed to changes of use, development, and the inability of operators and customers to defend themselves against rent increases and unfavourable changes to their terms of lease. Looking at the fine-grain, women's and BAME-specific LGBTQ+ spaces, already under-represented, have been disproportionately affected. There is an ongoing lack of established premises run by and for women, trans people and people of colour - even while there are long-standing and new events that move from venue to venue and serve important social functions for these groups. ""The qualitative and quantitative evidence we have collated disputes unsubstantiated but often repeated claims that LGBTQ+ spaces are no longer needed, or have been replaced by digital apps, which tend only to serve small sections of these communities. Where they have survived, LGBTQ+ spaces are extremely valuable - addressing quite different needs to 'LGBTQ+ friendly' spaces - and the consequences of closures are acutely felt."" In response to the research, The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has announced a series of initial measures to help stem the flow of closures, including: Instructing his Night Czar, Amy Lamé, to make protecting LGBTQ+ venues an urgent priority by acting as a mediator between venue owners, and developers and pub companies, and reaching out to venues in trouble to offer support from City Hall; Encouraging venues to sign up to a new LGBTQ+ Venues Charter; Carrying out an annual audit of LGBTQ+ venues so that the number of LGBTQ+ venues in the capital can be tracked more closely, and efforts can be made to stem the flow of closures in the city Building safeguarding measures into planning process, including an Agent of Change planning principle to be introduced in the next London Plan. Commenting on the report, the Mayor said that the figures showed that ''urgent action'' was needed and that he will do all he can ''to halt the closures of these precious venues and encourage others to open."" London has suffered several high-profile LGBTQ+ venue losses over recent years, including The Black Cap in Camden, The Joiner's Arms in Tower Hamlets and The Queen's Head in Chelsea.

Edge brings together practitioners and thinkers at three 'edge' locations connected by the High Speed 1 railway, which acts a geographical link and embodies ideas associated with community, connectivity and escapism. Through each of these events we invite participants to respond to a series of 'edge' locations, drawing on their own individual approaches and fields of operation to investigate particular sensory, social, environmental and other conditions. Over the course of the three days we hope to generate a wider conversation exploring the creative use of interstitial spaces. All are welcome to participate in this interdisciplinary adventure. The audience is invited to follow from one event to the next, engaging with each place as a manifestation of a particular kind of 'edge': GATEWAY (14 SEPT)UCL BLOOMSBURY, LONDON For this first event, we consider Bloomsbury and King's Cross as 'edge' locations. The Gower Street campus of UCL was planned and built on the urban/rural edge of nineteenth-century London, a 'learning' gateway through which generations of students have now passed, and one which now runs up against the King's Cross development, conceived as a mix of 'knowledge' and 'transport' gateways.

Investment for the 2012 Games brought rapid development to the previously neglected Stratford area. Here East, within the former press and broadcasting centre of the Games, is envisaged as a cluster of innovators and digital makers, whilst the Stratford Waterside development will bring new institutions including the V&A, Sadler's Wells, London College of Fashion, and UCL.

At the littoral edge of southeast England, its urbanism connect equally with water and land. From 1842 to 1992 it was the main pivot for passenger transport between France and England, and with the more recent construction of HS1, Folkestone has been gifted the questionable status of dormitory suburb to the Capital.

Architecture and film are interlocked: both unfold narrative ideas through space and time, taking us to real and virtual worlds; both start with the imagination, and then take on their own reality. Films are set in cities, landscapes and buildings where architecture is a visual shorthand, telling us about characters and plot in an instant, yet a dedicated festival that brings architecture and film together has never before been held in this country. Urban Lab Films will present two films which explore our sensory interactions with the city's built environment, provoking a deeper understanding of how people are affected by transformative architectural change. Thursday 8 June, 18.30 - 20.30 Dir: Joachim Trier, 2011, 95 mins, in Norwegian with English subtitles Based on the duration of a single day, the film follows Anders, a recovering drug addict, through the city where he grew up. Intending to get his life back on track, Anders visits an old friend and goes to a job interview, recognising how the world has moved on without him. Focusing on his body, his experiences and health issues, the city is explored as small pockets of intimate spaces, forming a sensitive and final goodbye with a place and its people. Urban Lab Films say: ""The film is a melancholic and psychological wayfinding course around an Oslo reminisced for its lush green spaces and ethereal morning cycle rides. As Andres navigates through this environment in an attempt to reunite with friends and family, memories are witnessed through the prism of an evolving cityscape - one in constant architectural and sociological change and filled with associations and temptations."" The director Joachim Trier and scriptwriter Eskil Vogt will be in discussion with UCL Scandinavian Studies' Dr Claire Thomson following the film. The Guardian - ""intelligent and resonant... very rewarding"" ★★★★The Telegraph - ""luminously moving"" ★★★★Little White Lies - ""An astounding achievement, Joachim Trier's haunting film will stay with you for weeks."" ★★★★★New York Times - ""bristles with suspense and ambiguity""In partnership with the Royal Norwegian Embassy in London.Tickets: £11 Standard / £8 Concessions / £7 ICA Members. Book tickets here. Saturday 10 June, 14.00 - 15.40 Dir: Tom Wolseley, 2017, 100 mins, United Kingdom Produced over a year's artist residency at UCL Urban Laboratory and UCL Geography, this meditative film about Western Europe's tallest building, juxtaposes views of the Shard from different vantage points around South London with contrasting narratives about the building and the filmmaker's own response to living in its shadow. 'In a city I have lived in for 30 years a transformation is occurring. It is at once obvious, in its massive demolition and construction, yet beyond my experience and understanding. It is all too easy to simply identify this change with a new sublime of global capital. Vertical Horizons tries to expand how the Shard, as an event, is grounded in the complexity of the city, our experience and lives within it.' The film asks questions about the relationship between the individual and the larger global dynamics that are manifesting themselves in the changing landscapes of major cities such as London. There will be a Q&A with Director Tom Wolseley, and his research material relating to the production of the film will also be on display. Free entry, no booking required. More information here. Former Urban Lab artist in residence Max Colson has been shortlisted in the Fiction Short category for his film Construction Lines (8 mins, 2017). You can see it as part of a curated evening of shorts at the ICA on Sunday 11 June.

115,Engaged Urbanism in LSE Review of Books,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/apr/engaged-urbanism-lse-review-books,10 April 2017,"Reviewed by Helen Traill the article describes the book as 'a well-presented and provocative read, and a timely exploration of creative urban research.' The review concludes that 'Engaged Urbanism demonstrates an array of creative and critical responses to the urban. It asks questions of authorship and expertise, asking who gets to write research agendas and challenging the academic text as a form of 'situated knowledge'.' Published in December 2016, Engaged Urbanism showcases the exciting ways urbanists are working towards fairer cities. Featuring novel uses and combinations of practice - from activism, architectural design and undercover journalism, to film, sculpture, performance and photography - in a diversity of cities such as Beirut, Johannesburg, Kisumu, London and Rio de Janeiro, Engaged Urbanism demonstrates how some of the greatest challenges for present and future populations are being rigorously and creatively addressed. The book features contributions from over forty urbanists in diverse fields, including Jane Rendell, Jennifer Robinson, Joanna Rajkowska, Suzanne Hall, Matthew Gandy, David Roberts, and John Aiken.

Art Night is an annual contemporary arts festival that transforms unsual locations across London on one night in the summer. Its first edition took place on 2 July 2016 in conjunction with the ICA. A second edition in east London follows on 1 July 2017, in partnership with the Whitechapel Gallery. In his contribution, ""Death Line, Life Line"", Matthew uses Gary Sherman's Death Line (1972), a horror film set on the London Underground starring Christopher Lee and Donald Pleasance, as a context, albeit a counter-intuitive one, for thinking about one of the Art Night installations from 2016 - the creation of a sensory environment on the platforms of a disused Jubilee line station by the Korean artist Koo Jeong A. The limited-edition book, edited by UCL STEaPP PhD student Enora Robin, critically explores the potential of contemporary arts for reshaping and reassessing our urban environments You can find out more, and purchase the book, from the Unlimited website."

118,New publication celebrates Brutalist architecture in Paris,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/mar/new-publication-celebrates-brutalist-architecture-paris,9 March 2017,"The brutalist architecture of the French capital is the subject of a new city guide published by Blue Crow Media in collaboration with Robin Wilson (Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL) and Nigel Green (Photolanguage). The guide features over forty leading examples of Brutalist architecture from celebrated buildings such as Maison du Brésil, the Communist Party Headquarters and UNESCO Headquarters by world-renowned architects such as Le Corbusier, Oscar Niemeyer, and Marcel Breuer to the masterfully designed buildings at Ivry-sur-Seine Reconstruction du Centre Ville, 'Les Choux de Créteil', and 'Les Damiers' apartments by equally influential French architects Jean Renaudie, Renée Gailhoustet, Gérard Grandval and Michel Folliasson. Many lesser known buildings such as Marius Depont's concrete Church of Saint André and Pierre Vivien's UFO-like Telecommunications Building are also featured. Written in English and French, the guide includes an introduction by Robin Wilson and photography by Nigel Green. Details for each building include the location, date, and the architects or practice responsible. Robin Wilson, co-founder of Photolanguage and lecturer at the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL, said: 'This map not only guides the reader to discover many of Paris's boldest and exciting post-war buildings, it also provides a different way to experience Paris as a city, to explore areas not usually on the tourist itinerary and to encounter some genuinely radical urban environments'. Post-war Brutalist architecture, as defined by critic Reyner Banham in 1955, aligns itself with the material honesty of the earlier work of Le Corbusier and August Perret, and incorporates within it both the French term le béton brut (raw concrete) and the expressionistic tendencies of art brut. Many of the Parisian Brutalists experimented with the structural and aesthetic properties of concrete, as the affordable construction material available in the period of post war reconstruction. However, the expressions of Brutalism are diverse, often using unusual combinations of building materials and producing a remarkable range of architectural forms and spaces. This style provoked strong reactions with heated arguments over the decades about whether these buildings were concrete eyesores or design icons. In recent years the tide of public opinion seems to be moving in their favour. The Brutalist Paris Map is designed to affirm the value of these buildings and to inspire further consideration of Brutalist architecture today. Priced at £8 (€9, $10 USD) plus shipping, it is available to purchase through Blue Crow's website and at independent bookshops across Europe."

121,Urban Laboratory launches UCL SITE: Students in the east research project,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/feb/urban-laboratory-launches-ucl-site-students-east-research-project,8 February 2017,"In collaboration with The Bartlett, UCL Urban Laboratory has launched a staff-student collaborative research project that will produce student-led recommendations for UCL developments in east London - UCL East and Here East. Thirteen students from a diversity of courses across the university and at different levels of study are participating. The project is operating as a comparative study, as students investigate the strengths and weaknesses of UCL's current Bloomsbury campus and existing non-campus sites to inform the new developments. Although aspects of both east London developments are finalised, there is still scope for students and staff to influence many decisions. A number of key themes have emerged from our discussions so far, including building a sense of identity and coherence between UCL's Bloomsbury and Stratford sites; community engagement in and around the Olympic Park; and student study experience, in particular facilities for quiet and group work. Over the next three months we'll be conducting further site visits and research activities to investigate topics in relation to these themes. An event for all UCL students to contribute to the project will be organised for late March. Ultimately, we will apply what we learn about the Bloomsbury campus and initial plans for UCL/Here East, and produce a series of recommendations for those leading the developments. SITE aims to be the beginning of stronger staff-student collaborative research into issues affecting everyone at UCL, as well as our neighbours in surrounding communities. A blog has been launched that will chart our progress and keep you informed on the project (blogs.ucl.ac.uk/site). An archive is also being kept on Storify. Funding for the project comes from UCL ChangeMakers and The Bartlett, Faculty of the Built Environment.

122,Call for Papers - Towards a Global Urban Geopolitics,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/feb/call-papers-towards-global-urban-geopolitics,7 February 2017,"UCL Urban Laboratory is happy to share this call for papers as part of the RC21 conference for critical urban studies at the University of Leeds on 11-13 September 2017. The session's underling argument is that we need to re-think the contested and conflictive practices of the material and immaterial ""planning/politics nexus"" from a comparative perspective. In other words, on the surface different cities share and are developing growing similarities stemming from ethnic, racial and class conflicts revolving around issues of housing, infrastructure, participation and identity, amongst others (Rokem, 2016). Our argument is founded on a joint critical reading of the growing literature on urban planning and politics from different urban settings with the aim of learning through elsewhere, rather than seeking out similarities (Robinson, 2016) as part of a general call to bring geopolitics into the mainstream of comparative urban studies (Rokem and Boano, forthcoming 2017). The session's main objective is to bring together a selected group of international scholars engaging with comparative urban geopolitics. We are interested to explore the relational and contrastive value of comparisons across 'Northern' and 'Southern' contexts and especially cities from 'South-Eastern' non-conventional regions normally excluded from academic debates moving beyond the 'North-Western' theory producing usual suspects. In doing so, this session seeks to argue that it is timely to start learning from, and compare across different urban geopolitical contexts to promote urban spatial and social justice. Offering instead multiple access points, from which to explore the ever-expanding range of conflicts, contestations and cultural formations shaping our global urban future. We invite papers that discuss and address (although not limited to) the following broad topics: The role of urban geopolitics in different cities and neighbourhoods from a comparative perspective. Comparing how urban conflicts and divisions shape spatial and social justice for urban residents. Comparing planning and its (lack of) promotion of spatial and social justice under extreme urban geopolitical conditions. The shifting roles of the neoliberal economy, ethnicity and race in shaping the futures of different contested cities. Learning from comparing urban geopolitics across 'Northern' and 'Southern' cities. Comparing urban geopolitics in cities from 'South-Eastern' non-conventional regions normally excluded from academic debates. Abstracts should be sent to RC21@leeds.ac.uk and the session organisers. Guidelines for submitting an abstract can be found on the RC21 website.

123,New book explores the ethics and philosophy of urban design,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2017/jan/new-book-explores-ethics-and-philosophy-urban-design,12 January 2017,"Camillo Boano (Director, MSc Building and Urban Design in Development at the DPU and Co-Director, UCL Urban Laboratory) has published a new book that bridges the gap created by the ""missing encounters"" between radical philosophy, urban design and architecture. The Ethics of Potential Urbanism: Critical Encounters between Giorgio Agamben and Architecture (Routledge, 2017), highlights the substantial possibilities of Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben's work for a renewed perspective on architectural and design practice in a time of neoliberal consensus and uncritical acceptance of the nature of life and society. The monograph traces the main features of an 'inoperative architecture' a 'destituent' way of dealing with urban design. Theorising with and through Agamben has helped provide a manner of looking at urban and spatial practices and a way of framing and understanding what is not simply instrumental but political and ethical; opening the possibility to determine counter-practices while being able to see architecture and urbanism under a renewed orientation and perspective. The book investigates the ways in which design practices in different parts of the world have to reconcile the current separation of urban design from radical thought - one that has happened either by ditching theory altogether, or by simply hiding in a formalist, autonomy-narrowing urban design, with a design mission that adheres to uncritical acceptance of the status quo. The monograph sits in Camillo's current research on asserting urban design as an expanded, critical and theory driven practice, through pedagogical innovation, action research and a creative use of theory. The book is available as hardback or as an ebook. A paperback edition will be published in 2017. Further links: Purchase the book at Routledge"
124,Curating the City research cluster runs first workshop in new Centre for Critical Heritage Studies,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2016/dec/curating-city-research-cluster-runs-first-workshop-new-centre-critical-heritage,14 December 2016,"The workshop organised by Clare Melhuish (UCL Urban Laboratory), Dean Sully (UCL Institute of Archaeology), and Henric Benesch (University of Gothenburg Academy of Design and Crafts) was framed as the first of two which will explore how universities, as mixed communities of interest dispersed across urban sites, are re-evaluating their institutional identities and heritage in the context of place-based spatial development. The second is planned to take place in Gothenburg in the spring, followed by publication of comparative findings. The workshops focus on two university campus development initiatives led by UCL and University of Gothenburg, which seek to engage with local people and neighbourhoods, and in turn participate in a re-shaping of ideas, narratives, and lived experience of urban heritage for the future. They will further consider the parallels between universities and museums as institutions engaged in the development of new urban imaginaries in postcolonial cities through collaborative processes of co-production with diverse local populations. Universities, like museums, are increasingly engaged in efforts to model new kinds of hybrid and inclusive institutional and urban spaces. An increasing number of university spatial development projects demonstrate a critical need for qualitative understanding of the lives of fellow citizens, as well as evaluation of their own institutional identities and heritage. Following Holston (1996), we might describe this as an ethnographic, rather than utopian, approach to space and its occupation, driving a cosmopolitanist - as opposed to monolithic - vision of university identity in relation to urban neighbours, and its materialisation through built and lived space. It opens up potential to embed a view 'from the periphery' at the heart of the institution and its development agenda, recognising alternative narratives of heritage and identity which draw on diasporic knowledge and facilitate ingenuity and grassroots participation in seeding spaces of the possible. The London workshop moved between university seminar rooms on its historic Bloomsbury campus, and a space at the emerging innovation centre at HereEast in the Olympic Park, which provided a base for exploring and experiencing the site of the UCL East campus and the nearby Olimpicopolis cultural quarter in the park. Participants included a mix of university campus project directors and public engagement staff; archaeologists who had worked on the Olympic Park; academics from digital media, anthropology and cultural studies, architecture, and design, of whom some were also residents local to the park; and curators from the V&A East project and its current artists in residence. On the first day the group focused on creating a space for critical examination of university discourses of heritage, identity, and civic engagement within the UCL/Gothenburg comparative framework, and by examining the real stories involved in the development processes at constrasting urban sites. On the second day, it focused on questions of narrative construction, representation, scale and territorialisation, comparing the UCL experience and public engagement agenda in the Olympic Park with that of the V&A, through its various initiatives. The workshop concluded with an evening lecture by Dominic Perring (UCL Archaeology), on the use of archaeology to construct narratives of memory and identity to support the urban reconstruction of post-conflict Beirut. Workshop participants included: Johan Oberg, University of Gothenburg Campus Nackrosen, project director; Martin Summersgill, UCL East project director; Haidy Geismar, UCL Anthropology; UCL East Academic Steering Group; Jonathan Gardner, Archaeology South East; Adam Brown, LSBU School of Arts and Creative Industries, Photography; Gabriel Moshenska, UCL Institute of Archaeology; Sol Perez Martinez PhD IoE/Bartlett PhD by design; Toyin Agbetu PhD UCL Anthropology; Harald Fredheim PhD University of York Archaeology; Phil Cohen, LivingMaps, UEL Cultural Studies; Catherine Ince, V&A East; Ruhul Abdin, Kazi Arefin: PARAA, artists in residence V&A East; Minna Ruohonen, UCL Public Engagement (East); Mattias Kärrholm, University of Lund (Architecture)."

Edited by Dr Ben Campkin and Professor Ger Duijzings, Engaged Urbanism showcases the exciting ways urbanists are working towards fairer cities. Its authors offer succinct, candid and carefully illustrated commentaries on the trials and successes of risk-taking research, revealing how they collaborate across fields of expertise, inventing or adapting methods to suit bespoke situations. Featuring novel uses and combinations of practice - from activism, architectural design and undercover journalism, to film, sculpture, performance and photography - in a diversity of cities such as Beirut, Johannesburg, Kisumu, London and Rio de Janeiro, Engaged Urbanism demonstrates how some of the greatest challenges for present and future populations are being rigorously and creatively addressed. Co-editor and Director of the UCL Urban Laboratory, Dr Ben Campkin said: ""Engaged Urbanism is a timely response to how governments and other agencies right now are acutely focused on the future of cities worldwide, as the recent launch of the New Urban Agenda at Habitat III, and the Sustainable Development Goals attest."" ""With this in mind, we think it's an important moment to be making the case for an experimental turn in methods of researching and understanding cities. We view Engaged Urbanism as a handbook of inventive approaches that will inspire researchers, activists, policymakers and service providers everywhere to question hierarchies of expertise, and work with available resources towards deeper knowledge that will in turn influence improved practice and more equitable cities."" Stemming out of the Cities Methodologies exhibition programme, Engaged Urbanism represents just a small selection of some of the many excellent contributions to Cities Methodologies over the years.

129,Clare Melhuish co-authored paper named Best Published Paper in City & Society,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2016/nov/clare-melhuish-co-authored-paper-named-best-published-paper-city-society,22 November 2016,"""The Real Modernity that Is Here"": Understanding the Role of Digital Visualisations in the Production of a New Urban Imaginary at Msheireb Downtown, Doha appears in the August issue of the journal, and the prize was announced on Thursday 17 November by the Society for Urban, National, and Transnational/Global Anthropology (SUNTA) at the American Anthropological Association annual conference in Minnesota. Melhuish et al's paper examines the role played by digital visualisations in the development, communication and materialisation of a large-scale urban development project, Msheireb Downtown, in Doha, Qatar. It is based on ethnographic research data collected by Melhuish in the architects' and clients' offices in London, Liverpool, and Doha, in 2012. During the course of the research she made numerous fieldtrips to Doha, a city in the process of an accelerated transformation designed to re-position it as ""an autonomous, postcolonial, urban hub in a network of world cities"" (226). The paper describes the context for this ongoing transformation, and examines how the design code and architectural proposals developed for the flagship Msheireb development, through the medium of digital visualisations, ""inter-reference a mix of European, American, and traditional Qatari architectural and urban features"" (236). The paper argues that the renewal project is an attempt to move away from Western-influenced urbanism and toward a more ""hybrid postcolonial urban aesthetic"" (241), which is enabled by digital visualising technologies. The prize-winning paper represents one in a trio of co-authored publications by urban anthropologist Dr Clare Melhuish, cultural geographer Professor Gillian Rose (The Open University), and cultural sociologist Dr Monica Degen (Brunel), who formed the cross-disciplinary research team working on the ESRC-funded research project led by Prof Rose: 'Architectural atmospheres, branding and the social: the impact of digital visualising technologies on contemporary architectural practice' (Grant No. RES-062-23-3305). Each paper represents the specific disciplinary interests and expertise of its lead author, while demonstrating the benefits of collaborative exchange and a transdisiplinary outlook, as developed by the team over the course of the two-year programme (2011-2013). City & Society has been published by SUNTA since 1987, and publishes work that engages with contemporary urban issues and theories of urban change through rich ethnographic material, with an increasing focus on the cities of the global south. It draws directly on, and seeks to develop, the tradition of urban anthropology established by the Chicago School. Further links: Read the paper in City & Society"
130,Urban Pamphleteer #6: Open-source Housing Crisis launched on new series website,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2016/nov/urban-pamphleteer-6-open-source-housing-crisis-launched-new-series-website,21 November 2016,"The new issue of the Urban Pamphleteer series is now available to read online using the publication's new website: urbanpamphleteer.org. Open-source Housing Crisis responds to the urgent need to invent new ways of approaching London's rapidly escalating housing crisis and engages critically with its underlying logics. Urban Pamphleteer is a series of publications that confront key contemporary urban questions from diverse perspectives. Written in a direct and accessible tone, with design embedded from the beginning of the editorial process, these pamphlets draw on the history of radical pamphleteering as a tool for instigating change. Edited by Ben Campkin and Rebecca Ross, and designed by Guglielmo Rossi, previous issues have dealt with smart cities, regeneration in London, security design, heritage in Doha, and global urban higher education. About Urban Pamphleteer #6 London has entered a period of deep reconfiguration following Brexit, the scope and implications of which are yet unclear. Add to this the compounded effect of those already dis-enfranchised following years of austerity. With regards to housing in particular, predictions range from a property value crash, to a stall of all new building, to London real estate attracting even more foreign investment given the weak pound. What is clear is that there are as yet unknown challenges ahead and perhaps also some new possibilities. However, in the context of a dizzying plethora of new communication channels and technologies, there are many questions that complicate this comparison that are explored throughout this issue: how can we ensure more accessible, wider scope, higher quality, and more impactful public conversations about housing amongst Londoners? Why are so many dis-advantageous conventions of the developer - real estate - government 'industrial complex' left unquestioned? If, whether we agree with it or not, the role of the consumer and the role of the citizen are convergent, how can Londoners come together to more effectively leverage this hybridity? Launched with an event at Central Saint Martins on 17 November 2016, the latest issue coincides with the launch of the new wesbite, ensuring the future sustainability of the Urban Pamphleteer series. Scans of the print version are available to read online, whilst users are asked to contribbute a small donation for the PDF version. Print editions can also be ordered via email@urbanpamphleteer.org.

131,UCL Urban Laboratory release new edited anthology Engaged Urbanism: Cities and Methodologies,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2016/nov/ucl-urban-laboratory-release-new-edited-anthology-engaged-urbanism-cities-and,10 November 2016,"We're pleased to announce the release of Engaged Urbanism: Cities and Methodologies, a new UCL Urban Laboratory edited anthology, on 1 December 2016. Published by I.B Tauris and edited by Dr Ben Campkin and Professor Ger Duijzings, the book showcases the exciting ways urbanists are responding to the variety and dynamism of contemporary cities and urban experience across the globe. Stemming from the Urban Laboratory's ongoing exhibition and events programme Cities Methodologies - organised in collaboration with the UCL Slade School of Fine Art - Engaged Urbanism contains contributions from over forty urbanists using novel combinations of practice - from activism, architectural design and undercover journalism, to film, sculpture, performance and photography - in a diversity of cities worldwide. Acting as a handbook for urban research practices, it offers succinct, candid and carefully illustrated commentaries on the trials and successes of risk-taking research, revealing how urbanists collaborate across fields of expertise, inventing or adapting methods to suit bespoke situations. Co-editor and Director of the UCL Urban Laboratory, Dr Ben Campkin said: ""Engaged Urbanism is a timely response to how governments and other agencies right now are acutely focused on the future of cities worldwide, as the recent launch of the New Urban Agenda at Habitat III, and the Sustainable Development Goals attest."" ""With this in mind, we think it's an important moment to be making the case for an experimental turn in methods of researching and understanding cities. We view Engaged Urbanism as a handbook of inventive approaches that will inspire researchers, activists, policymakers and service providers everywhere to question hierarchies of expertise, and work with available resources towards deeper knowledge that will in turn influence improved practice and more equitable cities."" In a response to the book, Professor AbdouMaliq Simone, author of City Life from Jakarta to Dakar, said: ""In the juggernaut knowledge industry, too little attention is paid to what knowledge really does. Engaged Urbanism provides a wide canvas of what actually does and could take place in urban spaces and provides creative methodological tools for supporting these actions, drawing out unanticipated, neglected and suppressed resources from even the most mundane, opaque or desperate places. ""In putting all our sensory capacities to work, it offers evidence of the efficacy of methodological invention and demonstrates the possibilities researchers, activists, service providers, and policymakers everywhere have available to deepen their understandings of urban life and to work creatively with what is available to them."" A launch event takes place at the Free Word Centre in London on 9 December 2016 (RSVP on the Free Word website), where the book will be available for the discounted price of £15. The book will be available on general release in the UK from 1 December 2016, and internationally on 30 December 2016. Further links: Engaged Urbanism launch event Engaged Urbanism on the I.B.

132,Urban Lab research evidences impact of LGBTQI nightlife venue closures on London's communities,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2016/nov/urban-lab-research-evidences-impact-lgbtqi-nightlife-venue-closures-londons,8 November 2016,"London's LGBTQI nightlife spaces have seen a recent intensity of closures, with further threats to the most longstanding venues, according to a new report from the UCL Urban Laboratory. Spaces catering to women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic LGBTQI people have been disproportionately vulnerable to closure. The research, which has used archives to pilot a mapping exercise of spaces going back to the mid 1980s, highlights the diversity of the capital's LGBTQI nightlife, as an important contributor to neighborhoods and the wider night-time and cultural economy. Through survey and interview data it also shows the importance of these spaces to community life, welfare and wellbeing. Conducted at the UCL Urban Laboratory by Dr Ben Campkin and Laura Marshall, the report urges politicians and policy-makers, including the Mayor, to positively respond to closures and pressures on venues and other spaces by building protection and promotion of LGBTQI spaces into the London Plan and local borough plans and policies. Drawing on survey evidence the report argues for the creation of a more favourable culture to support new and existing LGBTQI venues and events through recommending and enforcing improvements to licensing, policing, business regulation, rent conditions, statutory protections for buildings and businesses, subsidies e.g. for accessibility; and through promoting networking among LGBTQI venue owners and managers, night-time entrepreneurs and civil society organisations in order to promote the use of venues for a mix of uses including day-time uses of benefit to LGBTQI and local communities. Ben Walters, coordinator of the Queer Spaces Network, which supported the report, says: ""UCL Urban Laboratory's research is hugely welcome. This report confirms the vital historic and ongoing importance of London's spaces of LGBTQI community and culture; the scale of the challenge we face in defending them from rapacious redevelopment; the eagerness within the community to reinvent them for the twenty-first century; and the necessity that all levels of government step up to support that evolution. ""More than that, UCL Urban Laboratory's report is a wake-up call to all Londoners who value independent, alternative and underground life in the capital. Unless we champion it now, London will become a wilderness of luxury and alienation."" Dr Ben Campkin, project lead on the report and Director of UCL Urban Laboratory, says: ""Our research evidences, for the first time, that there has been a recent intensity of closures of the most longstanding LGBTQI nightlife venues. Spaces directed towards women and BAME LGBTQI people have been disproportionately vulnerable to closure. Many venues remain at risk, including those the London LGBTQI community deem to be of most value - as places to socialise, be entertained, make art or find mutual support."" The research looks at London since 1986 - when the Greater London Council was disbanded, marking a shift in urban regeneration policy - to the present day - a time of wide reporting and activism around the closure of commercial LGBTQI spaces.

Taking place as part of the UTOPIA season at Somerset House and the London Festival of Architecture on 29 June, The Storm: A Utopian Forecast for London? emerges from Fourthland's social practice on various London estates and two years of research attendance at public enquiry and developer led consultations. The work has also developed in response to enquiries within the Urban Laboratory, including questions on education for the future city, the cultural representations of urban life through Cities Imaginaries, and concepts emerging from Cities Methodologies. This call is for short fragments or snippets of text and ideas to be included in the Storm and read out anonymously throughout the performance. The texts will feature alongside a series of objects and actions that simultaneously re-enact some of the hidden aspects of regeneration set within the context of the UTOPIA programme and the 'Community' theme of this year's London Festival of Architecture. The contributions will produce a cacophony of sound that frame an interdisciplinary discussion after the re-enactment. We are interested in collecting voices and documents for The Storm from a diverse range of texts. Extracts of texts to be included in The Storm need to be sent to isik.knutsdotter@gmail.com by Friday 17 June. The Storm will take place on the evening of Wednesday 29 June, 19.00 - 21.00 in the Utopia Treasury of Somerset House, with an accompanying installation on display from 27 June - 3 July. Places will be allocated via a ballot, opening next week on the Somerset House website.

By gathering community knowledge from people with a range of perspectives, identities and experiences we hope to capture the diversity, complexity and value of LGBTQI nightlife spaces. So that we can understand how different phases of London's regeneration have influenced LGBTQI spaces, our research will focus on gathering evidence of spaces that have opened, closed or continued from the mid-1980s to the present. There has recently been wide reporting and activism around the closure of commercial LGBTQI spaces, with a number of ongoing high-profile cases in the media. We are also aware of a number of new spaces and events that have launched recently. And in the present moment, following the election of the new Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and London Assembly members, there are renewed discussions of policy change to support culture, social integration and the night-time economy. In this context, we hope our research will contribute positively to these debates, adding evidence on what is happening or has recently happened, and on what kinds of spaces LGBTQI communities, in all their diversity, value. We hope that you will take the time to contribute your views and expertise. Given the timeframe of influencing the Mayor and GLA's strategies, we're keen to hear from you as soon as possible - we aim to finish gathering information by 15 June 2016. Please circulate the project website and survey amongst your networks and encourage others to respond. There are different surveys for community members, venue owners and managers, event promoters, and performers.

In his paper 'Connected and Controlled: Surveillance, Security and Cities', Rodrigo explores the dilemma of dependence of post-modern societies on the pervasive and controllable capabilities of digital technologies. The possibilities for programmable cities and the city of the Internet of things are confronted with selective processes of place-making and territorialisation. This exposes the risks of having smarter technologies, smarter things, smarter places, and smarter cities, being used and populated by an increasingly divided mass of a few privileged smart people and many dumb citizens. In this paper Rodrigo calls attention to the tyranny of the smart! Published by the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, LA+ (Landscape Architecture Plus) draws out landscape architecture's interdisciplinary potential, bringing together a collection of contemporary thinkers and designers. The theme for this issue is Tyranny, questioning the rigid barriers of military zones to the subtle ways in which landscape is used to 'naturalize' power. Matthew Gandy, previous Director of UCL Urban Laboratory, contributes an article that shines a light on the very first tool of modern surveillance: artificial illumination.

Through education, it is possible to question, evaluate, relocate and re-identify this position. Where is intervention most critical, most effective? How can educational institutions learn from each other, recognize common ground and unite to challenge existing models which simplify, segregate and monopolize urban space? We have observed that although urban issues are complex, space has been simplified, although cultural diversity is rich, daily existence is segregated and although resources are plentiful, access is scarce. The laboratory format of Urban Lab+, a network of urban laboratories across the globe, aims to step outside the standard university framework and find new ways of preparing for action, for reflecting on and interacting with, the urban environment. It aims to turn the tables between Europe and the Global South, between theory and practice and between inside and outside institutions. In order to guide the makers of the future environment, it pursues an expanded range of practices, protagonists, disciplines and ""cultures"" in the urban debate. Turning Tables describes our combined positions. On the table, eight placemats set a place for each urban laboratory plus one placemat that represents all the ""others"" who will join the table during the Biennales time. At a range of scales and in diverse cultural contexts, the projects embedded in this table will tell the stories of our Topics - Commons, Climate and Social Relations - our Strategies - Reappropriation/Regeneration, Adaptation/Mitigation, Cooperation/Inclusion - and our Tools - Games, Online Platforms and Maps. A participative educational program will be developed for the table over the period of the Biennale: interested groups and biennale visitors are invited to participate in the learning exchange at the table and expand or contribute to, the stories initiated by our labs. It will become a space and an educational resource for all in an open-ended process. Accompanying the events at the table, an online platform records and organizes events in real time, but also offers a virtual space and time at the table for distant participants. Turning Tables is the platform utilized to present positions and to create an evolving set of relationships, which we argue will be essential to our very existence in time and space- new forms of learning  and collaboration must be found. Turning Tables refers to the exchange of expertise, dialogue and democracy, but also to a purposeful critique, suspicion, rejection and reversal of existing paradigms.

Its remit is to respond to the challenges posed by heritagization processes and globalisation, including the hegemony of 'North Atlantic universals' in heritage policy and practice. It will lead the way in defining a new field of critical heritage studies which identifies and interprets evolving, multi-scalar forms of heritage and identity, and addresses issues of heritage justice. UCL Urban Laboratory is part of one of the centre's five research clusters, 'Curating the City -Transdisciplinary Approaches in Urban Settings'. The research cluster, led by Henric Benesch (Academy of Design and Craft) and Ingrid Martins Holmberg (Department of Conservation) at the University of Gothenburg and Clare Melhuish (UCL Urban Laboratory) and Dean Sully (Institute of Archaeology) at UCL, will host and promote research, seminars, and public events between Gothenburg and London over an initial three-year period, and co-produce publications. Some of the themes which the Urban Laboratory is proposing to explore in collaboration with its partners, and with a focus on practice-based research, include: university-led regeneration and heritage encounters with urban people (specifically looking at plans for UCL East and UGOT's Campus Nackrosen and their engagement with local communities in a postcolonial urban context); the city as mnemonic device: forgetting and remembering through the city, including hidden sites of London; and critical heritage and queer space, engaging with built environment heritage of LGBTQ groups (led by Ben Campkin). The c. £3.7m funding for the Centre has been awarded for six years from April 2016 by the University of Gothenburg Centers for Global Societal Challenges call for research centre funding. The funding was awarded to Kristian Kristiansen and Ola Wetterberg at the University of Gothenburg and Beverley Butler, Rodney Harrison and Mike Rowlands at UCL. Other clusters as part of the centre will include: Making Global Heritage Futures; Embracing the Archive; Heritage and Wellbeing; and Science and Heritage/Critical Conservation Studies.

Produced by Approved by Pablo and curated by Urban Laboratory Steering Committee member Rafael Schacter, the exhibition explores unsanctioned public art - or graffiti - as an intrinsically utopian practice. Artists participating include Shepard Fairey, Swoon, REVOK, Eltono and Filippo Minelli. Following a successful start in early March, the exhibition hosted two artist residencies from Antwan Horfée and Russell Maurice, from 13 - 20 April, in the Courtyard Rooms of Somerset House, providing visitors with an insight into the processes of the practice. Urban Laboratory initiated events have included an enjoyable utopian-themed music night - Stadtklang - and utopian discourses on topics such as the city's representation in utopian ficton and how the contemporary can be explored in the imagined futures of both fictional utopias and dystopias. Positive press feedback on Venturing Beyond came from outlets including the BBC, The Guardian, Reuters, uncube, and many more. If you are unable to attend the exhibition, you can view the works online in a digital preview. The exhibition has been part of UTOPIA 2016: A Year of Imagination and Possibility."

The feature examines how artists explore the urban spaces that have been laid to waste throughout the modern and postmodern era, thinking through what public space means today and considering how artists research the security issue in privatized-public space, through an interview with former Urban Laboratory Artist-in-Residence Max Colson. The three articles featuring Urban Laboratory research are: Invisible Surplus Space: Art in Urban Settings Again, What is Public Space?: The Neoliberal City and Security Systems Interview│Max Colson: The Ruse of Invisibility You can find full-text of the articles in SPACE issue April 2016, Vol. 581.

Drawing on many different strands of theoretical inspiration, urban scholars are concerned to build wider knowledges about the urban across the very great diversity of urban outcomes around the world. It is a time of some theoretical ferment in the field, and UCL Urban Laboratory has hosted a series of events to address these themes; it is evident that there are many UCL urban scholars contributing to these debates. There is a close synergy between these concerns and those raised by the UCL Institute of Advanced Studies, which provides a home to the collective 'area studies' research groupings at UCL but seeks to open the historical configurations of region and place to question under the rubric Area Studies Re-Mapped or 'Area Studies without Borders'. We felt that there was a strong shared interest in building theoretical insights from the rich experiences of specific regions and distinctive cities, while being alert to how these experiences are shaped by wider processes of globalisation. Conceptualisation, then, need to navigate these trajectories of connection and differentiation. This symposium, ""Global Urbanisms, Regional Specificities"", invites UCL scholars to examine these themes across different disciplinary traditions in relation to urbanisation. UCL PhD students and UCL staff are invited to participate in the symposium. Places will be limited but as we would like to keep the event as open as possible, we are inviting proposals (a) to participate in the symposium and (b) to present papers on specific themes. In order to reserve a place in the symposium, please submit a statement of 100-250 words outlining how your current research interests relate to the symposium theme. If the Symposium is oversubscribed we will select participants on the basis of the best fit with the topics. If you would like to apply to present a paper, please submit an abstract of 250-500 words outlining your proposed contribution, speaking to one of the themes below. If you would like to join together with 3 or 4 colleagues to propose an additional related theme or topic which is not currently included below, please do so, and submit the papers as a group. We hope that the Symposium will provide the basis for a distinctive UCL publication on Global Urbanism. All proposals to participate and/or to present papers should be submitted to jordan.rowe@ucl.ac.uk, with the subject head: 'IAS-Urban Lab Symposium' by Thursday 14 April 2016. Please state your UCL affiliation on your application. The symposium takes place on 16-17 May 2016.

Keynote lectures will be delivered by Professor William Sharpe and Professor Joachim Schlör. William Sharpe (Barnard College, Columbia University) is the author of New York Nocturne: The City after Dark in Literature, Painting and Photography (winner of the Peter S. Rollins Award of the Northeast American Studies Association and the MSA Book Prize of the Modernist Studies Association) and will be introduced by Dr Matthew Beaumont (UCL, English), author of Nightwalking: A Nocturnal History of London. Joachim Schlör Professor of Modern Jewish/non-Jewish Relations, Director of the Parkes Institute for the Study of Jewish/non-Jewish Relations, University of Southampton and author of Nights in the Big City: Berlin, Paris, London 1840-1930 will deliver the second keynote lecture of the day. The film director Barnaby Southcombe will present his feature film I, Anna (2012), a noir thriller set in London, followed by a question and answer session with the audience. The shift from the diurnal to the nocturnal city will be the over-arching theme of the day's talks.  As the notion of London as a 24 hour city is debated and plans for the night tube put on hold, we will consider the way in which cities have been the loci of inclusion and exclusion, policing and controlling, after-hours.  The historical relevance of the night-time curfew will be considered in relation to contemporary policing of night-time, addressing, for example, the implications of the state of emergency declared in France following the attacks in Paris in November 2015 which allows for the imposition of curfews by the state. The impact on the inhabitants of the city streets after hours will be considered in relation to the increasing use of ""hostile architecture"" in public spaces. The event aims to build on the success of the first Cities After Hours colloquium held in May 2015 at UCL, and to open up participation to a wider audience beyond UCL. We invite abstracts up to 500 words for 15-20-minute papers. Abstracts should be sent by email to citiesafterhours@ucl.ac.uk by the deadline of Monday 4th April 2016. It is planned that  a collection of scholarly essays based on selected papers from the day will be published (the colloquium organisers are already in discussion with UCL Press) Admission to the colloquium will be free thanks to the generous support of UCL JFIGS, UCL SELCS, UCL Urban Laboratory. The colloquium will be part of UCL's week-long Festival of Culture. Further links: Call for Papers (pdf)"
151,Urban Lab to curate Venturing Beyond cultural programme at Somerset House,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2016/feb/urban-lab-curate-venturing-beyond-cultural-programme-somerset-house,15 February 2016,"UCL Urban Laboratory is pleased to announce a collaboration with arts organisation A(by)P for the Venturing Beyond: Graffiti and the Everyday Utopias of the Street exhibition, which opens on Thursday 3 March as part of the 'UTOPIA 2016' season. The exhibition explores unsanctioned public art - or graffiti - as an intrinsically utopian practice, arguing against the traditionally-held belief of graffiti as a dystopian movement or 'glorified vandalism'. Venturing Beyond will showcase the specially-commissioned work of seventeen street artists from around the globe, from stars of the scene such as Shepard Fairey, Swoon and REVOK, to critically acclaimed artists such as Eltono and Filippo Minelli, each of whom will produce or specially select pieces responding to this theme. In a literal sense, graffiti compels its practitioners to 'venture beyond' spatial and architectural boundaries, but also metaphorically provokes them to 'venture beyond' conceptual frontiers, to form new ways of thinking, acting and being in the world. Graffiti ornaments the city in resplendent colour and brings art out into the open, an art which belongs to all of us. It simultaneously reveals an aesthetic and social practice which anyone is welcome to join. Above all, graffiti and street art acts as an alternative voice, whether it is loud and brazen or more subtle and difficult to decipher, which strives to challenge the well-worn systems of society - something which Thomas More's seminal text also set out. All of the artists will uniquely interpret their ideas on these utopian foundations of graffiti. The cultural programme will include a wide-range of events that follow the key themes of the exhibition, including a special edition of the Urban Lab's Stadtklang music evening on Sunday 20 March, and a number of workshops, talks, and performances. More information will be posted on the UCL Urban Laboratory and Somerset House websites later this month. The collaboration builds on the Urban Laboratory's recent support for the Mapping the City exhibition which took place at Somerset House in winter 2015.

Its role as a space where gay identities and communities were made has shaped the urban experience of many LGBT people in London. However, with the advent of online spaces, the increasing inclusion of LGBT people in British society, and the rise in popularity of different urban areas, Soho's role for the LGBT community of London must now be reconsidered. This one day conference will try to answer the following questions: Can Soho still be seen as London's gay district? Why are so many LGBT spaces disappearing from Soho? Is there still the need for such spaces? If Soho disappeared, how would LGBT people experience a sense of community? Are new types of LGBT spaces appearing somewhere else? The first session will retrace the history of the district, from its creation in the sixteenth century to the gay 'takeover' of the area in the 1980s and 1990s. We will then proceed by examining contemporary Soho and what LGBT people really think of the area. In a final session, we will consider the recent disappearance of LGBT spaces from Soho and other areas of London and we will discuss possible solutions for the future. The second session, specifically, will concentrate on alternative experiences of Soho, with particular attention to the link between space and identities/communities in the area. These include (but are not limited to): - Absence/creation of spaces for gay women - Re-thinking gay spaces for LGBT people with disabilities - Queering LGBT spaces - 'Making space' for older/younger LGBT people - Being BME in Soho - Performing spaces/ performing identities - Transgender identities - Creating community in space - Gay male misogyny/transphobia - (De)Constructing heteronormativity within LGBT spaces - LGBT spaces and the straight gaze The conference is organised by  Marco Venturi, PhD candidate in Gender and Sexuality Studies (CMII), UCL. Please submit a title and abstract (no more than 250 words) to Marco Venturi (m.venturi.12@ucl.ac.uk) by Wednesday 31 December 2015. Contributions from postgraduate students are particularly welcome. The conference will be hosted on Saturday 20 February 2016 at St. Anne's Church and Community Centre in Soho. Find information on the conference here.

Remaking London (I.B Tauris, 2013) provides a historical account of urban regeneration, exploring how decline and renewal have been imagined and realised at different scales. Focussing on present-day regeneration areas that have been key to the capital's modern identity, the book explores how these places have been stigmatised through identification with material degradation, and spatial and social disorder. Presented by the Urban Communication Foundation, the Jane Jacobs Urban Communication Book Award recognises excellence in addressing issues of urban communication and is named in honour of the late social activist and author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities. The jury described Remaking London as ""[A] methodologically sophisticated inquiry into the drive to ""regenerate"" areas of London seen as blighted or in decline. Surveying a diverse collection of texts ranging from individual buildings and temporary theater installations to photojournalistic essays and films, Campkin's analysis of the cultural discourse surrounding urban decline and regeneration in the UK's largest city is innovative, eye-opening and engaging. Given the intense debates occurring over the many regeneration schemes currently underway in the city, it is also extremely timely."" The jury was made up of Professor Steve Macek (Professor of Communication at North Central College and winner of the 2006 Jane Jacobs award), Sommer Mathis (editor of The Atlantic's CityLab website), and Theresa Bergman (Professor of Communication, University of the Pacific and winner of the 2013 Jane Jacobs award). The award was announced at the National Communication Association annual convention in Las Vegas on Saturday 21 November.

His preserved skeleton continues to gaze upon the university in a glass cabinet. Since 2013, a webcam (PanoptiCam) has been installed on the top of the Auto-Icon watching the reaction of passers-by looking at Jeremy's remains, and broadcasting the images via Twitter and Youtube. Dr Rodrigo Firmino, Honorary Senior Research Associate at UCL Urban Laboratory, has been pursuing a project watching Jeremy Bentham watching him watching Jeremy, in an extension of his research interests on cameras being used to watch public spaces.

It's an opportunity to write your dissertation on a topic that's a big part of the UCL 2034 plan and to be part of a multi-disciplinary team working across UCL, including Dr Clare Melhuish from the Urban Laboratory, whose case study research on university-led regeneration has just been published (see university-led regeneration case study research, and the university-led urban regeration blog). You will be joining a cross-disciplinary team of students which will meet monthly with Michael Stewart, Greg Thompson and others working in Newham, to work on dissertations dealing with important issues in the area.  During a two week UCL East summer school this year organised by Prof Stewart and Greg Thompson, students from universities across London and other young people from Newham investigated what UCL's new campus on the Olympic Park might mean for UCL. UCL students are now being encouraged to carry out further research to inform our thinking about the area we are moving into and about how UCL can contribute to civic life in our new neighbourhood. By developing relationships in Newham, and building on the work done by Kim Townsend, UCL's Public Engagement Co-Ordinator (East), UCL's academic community can shape decisions as to what a university can actually do in and for the area. Some proposed research topics and areas, informed by Urban Laboratory's case study research, include: Integration of natural and manmade environments at the Olympic Park: biodiversity Campus design including sustainability: how is sustainability defined, implemented and future-proofed? What does sustainability mean to local people and what is the interface with behaviour change? Masterplanning process - including urban design, project management, and management science dimensions. Processes and structures of governance inside universities and the results they generate. Impacts on development on land values and rents: how do people survive in a high rent city on low wages? Wellbeing - how is wellbeing defined, and what is the impact of university development on wellbeing, including areas such as housing and health? (eg ethnographic study of Guttman Centre; see also UCL Institute for Global Prosperity's Prosperity in East London project). What does wellbeing mean for different cultural groups in Newham, and how does country of origin influence people's social interactions and activities? Transnational (local/global) connections amongst Newham's population, and impacts on perceptions of locality and belonging. Local government (housing) policy - e.g. compare London Boroughs of Lambeth and Newham (see Urban Lab case study 5) - and intersection with national regeneration policy framework. Anchor institutions and local government - how are partnerships assembled, what drives those choices, and what are their consequences? Visions of education and Higher Education in Newham? What do people imagine a university to be? Local (critical) heritage - how should it be defined?

159,Call for Papers - The Architecture of Capital: Rethinking the Geographies of Design ...,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2015/oct/call-papers-architecture-capital-rethinking-geographies-design,7 October 2015,"Following the emergence of a renewed debate about the relationship of architecture to processes of capitalist urbanisation, a series of opposing conceptions of architectural or design methods have been espoused as either a tool of capital, or as a space of political imagination. Within architecture itself, the discourse similarly moves between the emancipatory politics of an architectural imagination (Lahiji 2014), and the persistence of early Marxist criticism established by Manfredo Tafuri (1979) and Frederic Jameson (1998) that architecture is an integral part of the capitalist project, entrenching existing power relations. As a result, inter-disciplinary conversations between architecture and the social sciences resonate around what is essentially a ""negative dialectic"". This is particularly seen in efforts by scholars to develop a language around the geographies of architecture. This ranges from, on the one hand, the works of King (1990, 2003) on the globalization of architecture, to a particular emphasis on non-representational theory in the relationship between design intention and use or appropriation (Lees 2001; Lees and Baxter 2011; Kraftl and Adey 2008); Kraftl 2010; Jacobs and Merriman 2011), as well as, on the other hand, the consideration of architecture as a ""big thing"", an assemblage of materials and political and economic processes (Jacobs 2006; Jacobs and Cairns 2008; Jacobs, Cairns and Strebel 2012a, 2012b). And yet, the relationship between architecture and capitalism in relation to processes of urbanization remains not only dichotomized, but also under-theorised. This is not simply an analytic gap, but has profound consequences for architectural pedagogy, for the entrenchment of disciplinary assumptions, and for the ability to forge new and inclusive urban politics that foreground design. In this panel, supported by UCL Urban Laboratory, the organisers seek to bring together scholars working on issues related to revisiting the relationship of architecture and capitalism. We seek papers that move beyond the totalizing narratives of architecture as a process and product of contemporary capitalism to theorizing the complexity of architectural method, rethinking the globalization of architectural production and design, and documenting the emergence of alternative models for architectural practice, and their relationships to structures of labour, class, race and gender, as well as material and political ecologies. Building on calls to rethink the relationship of architecture and geography beyond convenient narratives that might flatten both (Cairns and Jacobs, forthcoming 2015), we invite papers that interrogate architecture from a variety of geographical sites and moments. Topics across the global North and global South could include: • historical relationships between architecture, urbanism, and capitalism (reconsidering them theoretically and empirically) • emerging forms of the architectural collective • changing or entrenched geographies of architectural pedagogy, design and production • alternative architectural methods and practice (reconsidering tactics and strategies) • non-architectural built environment, architecture without architects • design process as a political possibility • political possibilities of an architectural imaginary (revisiting the propositional method) • thinking architectural possibility through critical queer, feminist, post-colonial, decolonial, or other perspectives • provincialising architecture beyond the canon If you are interested in joining the panel, please send abstracts of up to 250 words to Adam Kaasa (adam.kaasa@rca.ac.uk) and Pushpa Arabindoo (p.arabindoo@ucl.ac.uk) by 21 October 2015. Participants will be informed if they have been accepted by 23 October 2015. Accepted participants will then need to register online for the AAG meeting by the deadline of 29 October 2015. A further aim is for this panel to lay a strong foundation for a possible special issue edited by the organizers.

The case studies and introduction are the output of an 18-month research project, conducted by Dr Clare Melhuish, in parallel with the announcement and development of proposals by UCL to build a new campus in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford. In March 2015, the Urban Laboratory published a summary of interim findings from the research. The case studies now provide detailed insights into the processes of visioning, communicating, and developing urban spatial development plans which many universities are undertaking, often in partnership with other urban and regional regeneration agencies, and as a stimulus and anchor for wider urban development. They include Queen's Campus, Durham University in Stockton; the NorthWest Cambridge development by University of Cambridge; Newcastle University at Science Central; three US models - University of Pennsylvania, New York University, and Columbia University; and lastly Somerleyton Road in south London, a partnership between Lambeth Council, Brixton Green and Ovalhouse Theatre designed to promote a new model for community-owned affordable housing and social infrastructure. Each case study is presented in the same format for comparative purposes, structured in five sections: historical and policy contexts; structures and processes; visions and narratives; translation into place; and a concluding section summarising key issues and learning points. They draw on a mix of bibliographic and archival research, interviews, site visits and observations, and photographic documentation, with a view to developing some qualitative insights pertaining to specific projects as well as identifying some overarching principles. The case studies are prefaced by an introductory essay which provides an overview on university development, and sets it in context with reference to some of the main shifts in urban regeneration and higher education policy and practice, while highlighting the international scope of university expansion within cities as an aspect of the global production of cities as 'policy assemblages' from elsewhere (McCann and Roy 2013).

Surplus space refers to the sites or facilities that the (post-)industrial capitalist society inevitably produced throughout the twentieth century. The term 'surplus' is rooted in Bauman's idea of the two industries created in modern society - waste-disposal and security service - and the research will focus on the artistic practices that deal with these industries. This study will also look into surplus built environments in general, including structures that have become obsolete due to political or economic reasons. Looking at nature, built environments and human lives as equal ecological components, Jeong Hye Kim will analyse the way in which these elements merge or relate to one another. Artistic practices will include those from both European and Korean influences. Jeong Hye Kim is a researcher, editor, translator, and educator in Korea with a primary focus on architectural design and art in urban settings. Her government-commissioned public research includes the visual-spatial plan for the New Seoul City Hall (2013), the master curatorial plan for the National Design Museum of Korea (2012), and the master curatorial program for Dongdaemun Design Plaza (2012). Jeong Hye Kim  has been awarded the VIA Fellowship 2015 from the Korea Arts Management Service for this work. The fellowship runs until 15 December 2015. Image credit: photograph by Max Colson"

167,Cities After Hours: the shift from the diurnal to the nocturnal city,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2015/jun/cities-after-hours-shift-diurnal-nocturnal-city,5 June 2015,"Written by David Anderson, MPhil/PhD student, UCL English Cities After Hours began with a panel split between art made about the city and art made on the surfaces of the city itself. In fact, this distinction was soon demolished by Rafael Schacter, whose case against the term 'street art' drew on the fact that 'there are as many street arts as their are street artists'. Nevertheless, his reappraisal of 'independent public art' figured the nocturnal city as a space for transgressive sign-writing, a practice with a well-established international tradition. Meanwhile, Sabina Andron's paper diarised the life of graffiti in London, looking at the burgeoning phenomenon of 'street art tourism' and the ways in which a shift to daylight painting - at least for better-known artists - has led to a novel illumination of the form's processes, as well as its end-products. Her paper situated this growth in tolerance and appreciation of graffiti writing within the wider urban sign system, noting that the appropriation of street art techniques within advertising has contributed to a pronounced blurring of the geosemiotic field. Max Colson's work as an artist-in-residence at the Urban Lab took another approach to the complex of urban imagery, exploring the aesthetics of privatised public spaces and the system known under the unwieldy acronym 'CPTED' (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design). The work of his paranoiac alter-ego Adam Walker-Smith offered an acerbic take on this trammelling of the urban realm, while the project entitled 'Hide and Seek: The Dubious Nature of Plant Life in High Security Spaces', drew on a heritage of British surrealist photography. Margarita Saad, an artist embedded within the French department, took an entirely different tack. Employing the 'Oulipian' techniques of the French 'Workshop for Potential Literature', she restructured Paul Verlaine's poem 'Chanson d'Automne' as a looming cluster of skyscraper maquettes, transforming one saturnine rendition of the night-time city into another. Mara Arts, of the Centre for Multidisciplinary and Intercultural Inquiry, opened the second panel with her paper on representations of nightlife in early London cinema. Mara showed how the twin themes of pleasure-seeking and criminality found common ground in the nocturnal spaces of early twentieth-century London. Her emphasis on the importance of space, and the West End as a terrain of various forms of transgression, fed neatly into Chris O'Rourke's discussion of early cinema-goers themselves. Chris's research showed that cinema-going was as much about the consumption of space as of film. He emphasised how the purchase of a cinema ticket was not simply about seeing a particular film, but also - and often overwhelmingly - about the acquisition of 'time in the cinema' in a more abstract sense, too. If these papers inclined towards a clear distinction between the nocturnal and diurnal city, James Kneale's intricate study of Victorian licencing hours showed that the supposed division between sober working days and boozy nights out may well be a misleading simplification. Even if, as James claimed, 'drink was as much a part of the city after hours as gaslight was', the actual irregularities of its consumption illuminate the patchiness of day-time/night-time partitions. Huda Tayob's investigation of Cape Town's 'Little Mogadishu' - a centre for the South-African Somali community - perpetuated this theme of muddying clear categorisations of space and time. Huda's paper disclosed the fascinatingly opaque world of unofficial 'Somali Malls', housed within disused office blocks and other large buildings in the Bellville district of Cape Town. These 'subaltern public spaces' proved to be difficult to catch on film, owing both to cultural embargoes of photography and to their inhabitants' frequently dubious legal status. Not only did this mean that Huda's intervention was illustrated with wonderfully vivid sketches of the environments she'd studied; it also precipitated a lively discussion on the ethical dilemmas of photographing or documenting unofficially occupied spaces. The day's third panel was balanced between Paris, Los Angeles and London. Matthew Beaumont's paper on Ray Bradbury's 1953 short story 'The Pedestrian' offered a futuristic, Americana-inflected taster of where his work on London nightwalkers might stray. Beginning with the NYPD's infamous 'We Own The Night' slogan, Matthew framed 'The Pedestrian' as a 'dystopian science fiction fable'; a vision of ecological apocalypse in a line with Mary Shelley's The Last Man and Richard Jefferies's After London. The paper took these themes as a cue to recalibrate Bradbury's celebrated novel Fahrenheit 451 around the figure of the transgressive walker, imagining François Truffaut's garish film adaptation reworked as a nocturnal neo-noir. Taking up the theme of illicit locomotion, Ruth Austin's dissection of Jean Cocteau's poem 'Léone' foregrounded Cocteau's fantasy-vision of free movement through Paris during the Nazi occupation in 1942-4. Her discussion of the idea of 'curfew' (itself from the French 'cuevre-feu') as a highly relative phenomenon was precipitated by the fact of Cocteau's own exemption from the night-time ban that hampered his fellow Parisians. These thoughts led to a discussion of the extent to which this relativity obtained as a historical feature of curfews in general. After the blacked-out streets of occupied Paris, Roland François Lack's tour through the night-time landscape of pre-New Wave French cinema reconstructed the dizzy thrill of newly lit streets in the 1950s. His analysis tracked the constellations of neon nightclub signs around Pigalle, Montparnasse and the Champs-Élysées, turning noble gases into the waypoints of new nocturnal geographies. Back in early-modern London, Emma Whipday's paper on Shakespeare's Othello and The Merchant of Venice explored the 'obsessive association of thievery and darkness on the Elizabethan stage', investigating the interrelation of domesticity and femininity in Shakespeare's city (through the cipher of Venice). Drawing on the plays' presentation of the house as a source of both anxiety and fantasies of security, Emma argued that Shakespeare's nocturnal city has been under-represented as 'a space of illicit female autonomy'. The colloquium closed with a sandwich of short films, centred on William Raban's The Houseless Shadow. This languid cinematic rendering of Charles Dickens's extraordinary essay 'Night Walks' was made in 2011 under commission from the Museum of London, as part of Dickens's bicentenary celebrations. Using the text as a map, Raban plotted a path around after-hours London, shooting over the course of fifty nights. The film discovered unexpected continuities between contemporary London and that which Dickens represented in his essay, which closes on an encounter with a ragged waif near the church of St Martin's-in-the-Fields, precisely where many of the West End's homeless huddle around a soup kitchen today. Raban's film was bookended by Ralph Keene's 1958 Under Night Streets, a sprightly documentary about maintenance on the Tube network, and Nice Time, an experimental documentary from 1957 set around the magnetic nocturnal pull of Piccadilly Circus. Funded by the BFI's long dead 'Experimental Film Fund', Nice Time left a zest of the subversive creativity often stimulated by the sun's decline, both for the film-makers themselves and the immaculately turned-out revellers they depicted. David Anderson is an MPhil/PhD student researching ideas of aesthetic reclamation in the urban and exurban environment, with particular focus on the cinematic and critical works of Patrick Keiller. This extends into the conflicted relations of destruction, dilapidation and renewal, as well as the role of the image in the urban sign-system, looking in particular at how contemporary works engage with the heritages of Surrealism and Situationism. He has a strong parallel interest in the overlapping histories of real and imagined spaces in fictional works. David is a contributing editor at the online journal Review 31, and works as a freelance writer on literature and art. Image: 'The Remains' exhibit at Cities After Hours by Sam Nightingale"

This is displayed in a timeline, from archival records during the tower's design phase in the 1960s to the most recent press articles. These documents can be intimidating; difficult to access because they are hidden behind archival protocols, journal subscription costs and labyrinthine planning portals; or difficult to grasp because of bureaucratic, academic or legal language. For ease of understanding, the material is categorised under ten document types and filtered through a dozen questions. The responses to these questions reveal important information that has not yet been reported. It is hoped that the site may help contribute to an informed public debate on key issues before refurbishment works on the tower are laid out. A planning application for these works is due to be submitted shortly. It has been reported that, following the refurbishment, tenants on social rent will not be permitted to return to their flats in the tower."

Tom will create an essay film as a way to examine the Shard from a range of perspectives; emotional, economic, social, architectural, cultural, international, political and geographical, in a meandering narrative, that also references the construction of the film itself. The broader research will be archived on an interactive website. He has worked for over 20 years, creating films and installations that explore our relationship to the environment we live in, with increasing emphasis on film and the city.  He has collaborated with a diverse range of practitioners to develop a practice/methodology that reflects on its own condition as it does on the subject. He has created and worked within his own semi fictional institution, Architrope, previously based in an up-cycled shipping container in an urban park in Hackney, for 5 years. Tom is interested in the relationship between individuals and a city increasingly dominated by spectacular global narratives. He will be developing conversations across UCL's areas of expertise to engage and think about how we can use the Shard as a tool to understand the changing relationships between capital, the urban and ourselves. Tom would like to encourage anyone that is interested in participating in conversations about the Shard to get in touch with him (tom@architrope.com).

172,Call for papers: 'Placing' culture in urban China: Towards an interdisciplinary dialogue,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2015/apr/call-papers-placing-culture-urban-china-towards-interdisciplinary-dialogue,16 April 2015,"As the Chinese city transforms, arts and culture are widely used instruments of regeneration and competitive place promotion, and serve as well in the struggle to upgrade from labour-intensive manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy. The distinctive spatial articulations of cultural production in the context of the transitional Chinese city are of critical interest to the ongoing retheorization of the role of cultural production in the twenty-first century city broadly, and point towards possible urban futures for a country in a dynamic state of cultural redefinition. But arts and culture are not just associated with regeneration; they may also be used to contest the meaning and identity of urban space, politicize questions of belonging, and/or resist the insistent displacement pressures that accompany accelerated urbanization. Within this context, the proliferating artistic and cultural expressions themselves are also integral to the understanding of emerging China and its alternative urban imaginaries. Against the backdrop of cultural globalization and the homogenizing tendencies of the Western art market and international media circuits, Chinese arts and culture reassert the significance of internal visions, historical trajectories and endogenous capabilities. From the nascent cultural idioms of contemporary China we can draw insights into the negotiation of a shifting cultural identity and its relationship to new urban forms, political projections of the socialist state, and palimpsestic inscriptions of tumultuous Chinese cultural history. We are convening a workshop that seeks to initiate a dialogue among postgraduates and early career researchers engaged in the explication of the reflexive relationship between culture and place in China from multiple disciplinary perspectives. We would like to invite six papers, each contributing to either or both of the following research orientations: The role of arts and culture in the transformation of urban space in contemporary China; and/or The representation and re-imagination of the urban in contemporary Chinese artistic and cultural expression. Furthermore, we encourage each participant to reflect on how interdisciplinary exchange can enrich these investigations. We hope that the workshop will strengthen research networks and inspire new and innovative perspectives and methodologies, and we intend to explore publication opportunities for a selection of the workshop's papers. We are able to offer a modest amount of funding to support the travel of postgraduates accepted from outside London. We are pleased to announce that Professor Chris Berry (KCL Film Studies) will be reflecting on these research imperatives based on his own work on contemporary Chinese film. Additional invited speakers will be confirmed in the near future. To propose a paper, please send an abstract of no more than 200 words by May 15th to Murray Mckenzie (murray.mckenzie.14@ucl.ac.uk) or Yixiang Sun (yixiang.sun.11@ucl.ac.uk). Please also contact us with any other inquires about the workshop. We do not require participants to submit written papers in advance.

173,Interim research findings: university spatial development and urban regeneration,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2015/mar/interim-research-findings-university-spatial-development-and-urban-regeneration,26 March 2015,"New university developments are moving away from out of town campuses and focusing on integrated urban sites with good access to amenities and affordable housing. There are also high expectations of universities to lead the way in realising flagship developments which exemplify best practice in urban design, environmental and social sustainability. But universities are complex organisations and such projects require strong leadership, good communications, and solid financial underpinning to be successful. These are among the findings generated by 18 months of independent comparative research by Dr Clare Melhuish on university-led urban regeneration, which are summarised in a set of nine bullet points issued by the UCL Urban Laboratory today. It include insights into the following key issues which universities and their external stakeholders, including local authorities and communities, have to address in spatial development projects: Funding; governance and planning; academic planning; site characteristics; planning and regeneration contexts; masterplanning and design; briefing and appointments; community relations and engagement; translation into place and construction dynamics Dr Melhuish said: 'Universities negotiate visions of their own institutional identity and future trajectory through academic planning, but spatial developments give visual and material form to those visions for generations to come; that is why it's so important to plan carefully and get them right'. The research has incorporated an overview of university spatial development projects around the world, and in-depth case studies of Durham University's Queen's Campus in Stockton, Newcastle University's Science Central development, Cambridge University's North West development and a set of three US examples: University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University and New York University. The selected case studies were identified as major research institutions with global reach, located in contrasting urban contexts. The research demonstrates the impact of public funding cuts and intensifying international competition as key factors leading universities to invest in spatial expansion, and delivers insights into the institutional policies, visions, and processes involved in implementing major development plans. It further highlights the complexity of the urban and planning contexts which inform them, and of the impacts and projected impacts which they have on existing sites and communities from a regeneration perspective. An extended summary of the interim findings is available online. The full case studies will be made available later this year.

174,Urban Pamphleteer is 'Magazine of the Week' on MagCulture,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2015/mar/urban-pamphleteer-magazine-week-magculture,25 March 2015,"Urban Pamphleteer is produced by the UCL Urban Laboratory, with additional funding from the UCL Grand Challenge for Sustaiunable Cities. The publications confront key contemporary urban questions from diverse perspectives, written in a direct and accessible tone. The media website complemented the accessible and innovative design of the pamphlets, saying: 'For a publication that encourages urban interaction between the streets, the buildings and the people of a neighbourhood, this design makes a lot of sense: the layout is like a complex but perfect puzzle where each square section comes together harmoniously. 'In the 17th Century, pamphlet writers would use language that was easily accessible so that all sorts of readers could understand the radical ideas printed on the page. 21st Century Urban Pamphleteer uses design as a universal language to convey and emphasise the information in the text. Their visual eloquence is why Urban Pamphleteer is our Mag of the Week this week: it's the kind of publication that you wouldn't say no to if it were being handed to you on the street.' The Urban Pamphleteer series is designed by Guglielmo Rossi and edited by Ben Campkin (UCL Urban Laboratory) and Rebecca Ross (Central Saint Martins). Four editions have been published so far, available online as pdfs. Two further editions are due to be published this year on Open Source Housing and Global Education for Urban Futures. In December Pamphleteer was featured in an article by It's Nice That, who described it as 'densely packed with information'."

The Association of American Geographers (AAG) described the work as 'an innovative, fresh contribution with extensive scope and conceptual depth. It is case based with water as its connecting theme to illustrate the evolution of modern urban spaces. 'He draws upon many sources including poetry, film, and art to enhance our understanding of the city. Written in an engaging and accessible way this book is an outstanding contribution to the discipline. This exceptional scholarly work truly advances the art and science of the discipline.' The Fabric of Space (MIT Press, 2014) considers the cultural and material significance of water through the experiences of six cities: Paris, Berlin, Lagos, Mumbai, Los Angeles, and London. Tracing the evolving relationships among modernity, nature, and the urban imagination, from different vantage points and through different periods.

The intention is to draw out and confront the complexities of each subject from diverse perspectives, in a direct and accessible-but not reductive or didactic-tone. In the tradition of radical pamphleteering, the broader aim is to empower citizens and inform professionals, organisations, institutions and policy-makers, with a view to actively influencing urban debate and positively shaping change. The pamphlets are economically produced, carefully designed and widely circulated, both as hard copy and digitally. The first four issues have been published: Urban Pamphleteer #1 Future & Smart Cities (April 2013) Urban Pamphleteer #2 Regeneration Realities (December 2013) Urban Pamphleteer #3 Design & Trust (October 2014) Urban Pamphleteer #4 Heritage & Renewal in Doha (November 2014) Urban Pamphleteer #6 Open Source Housing Crisis (forthcoming 2016) We are now soliciting contributions of 400-800 words and/or images/visual essays for Urban Pamphleteer #5: Education for Urban Futures This issue aims to stimulate a critical discussion about the future of higher education focused on cities and urbanization. In a world that is both rapidly urbanising and globalising, it is widely acknowledged that it is crucial to facilitate urban education that is cross-, inter- or trans-disciplinary; based on global knowledge addressed towards international issues; and engaged with live projects or taught through approaches defined as practice-oriented or laboratorial. Yet it is not always clear how these ambitions can best be achieved, especially to ensure urban education plays a constitutive role in addressing issues of urban exclusion or inequality, and global disparities in the production of urban knowledge and application of expertise. What challenges do trends in global urban theory, policy and development pose for contemporary educational practice? What are the origins, institutional contexts and futures of international approaches to urban higher education? What are the challenges and opportunities of internationalising urban pedagogy today? What good models exist that best facilitate working across different geographical contexts? New perspectives on these themes might include, for example, projects that document, contextualise and comment on existing pedagogies and teaching, as well as critiques of existing models, and suggestions of future challenges and opportunities. We are interested in featuring innovative, critical and speculative pedagogies that are cross-/ inter- and trans-disciplinary, practice-oriented, and/or comparative; and/or which help to facilitate international collaboration/comparison through visual methods and/or digital platforms. We are keen to feature work by educators, academics, students, policy makers, built environment practitioners, NGOs or others with relevant views and expertise. Submissions to Urban Pamphleteer are peer reviewed and edited by a small team of series and guest editors. We are looking to select approximately 15 contributions that directly address one or more of the questions or issues above, and which represent a variety of approaches. In making the final selection, we will be looking to feature the widest possible range of perspectives, through high quality writing and images, with ideas presented rigorously and accessibly.

University College London (UCL) will be hosting an international symposium on global approaches to urban higher education on 16 and 17 September 2015. This event forms part of the  Urban Lab+ initiative funded by the European Union's Erasmus Mundus programme and including eight urban laboratories from across the world. These units have in common their dedication to multi-/cross-/inter- and trans-disciplinary learning; their emphasis on hands-on collaborative research and education; and their attempts to bring together the disciplinary resources of the academy with the practical spheres of architecture, urban design and planning. Working in partnership the labs have been engaged in conversations focused on how interdisciplinary, practice-oriented and international approaches to built environment education relate to the question of urban social inclusion and exclusion.The Urban Lab+ London Symposium will comprise three elements: a public presentation of collaborative projects by the eight urban laboratories on the afternoon of 16 September 2015; a public panel discussion, reception and exhibition on the evening of 16 September with contributions from academics, practitioners, policy-makers and activists on the topic of internationalising urban higher education; a symposium featuring peer-reviewed papers and presentations on 17 September offering opportunities to share and discuss experiences of, and approaches to, internationalising urban education.

Proposals will be blind peer reviewed.  It is envisaged that some of the selected contributions will contribute to a planned anthology with essay-length contributions aimed at urban educators, policy-makers and students. Proposals are invited which address the following themes and questions, or related areas: What challenges do trends in global urban theory and in global urban development pose for contemporary urban educational practice? Which urban educational practices might help to challenge epistemological and geographical hierarchies in urban education? How can curricula best respond to, and draw on, the different international experiences and cultural backgrounds of students on urban-related programmes? How can students be prompted to critically reflect on the processes of globalised urban knowledge production and circulation of which they are often a constitutive part? How can urban education develop students' professional and ethical competences in relation to globalised urban development practice? What potential is there for urban knowledge to be co-created amongst different international institutions and across different regions through collaborative pedagogic practices? Can international comparisons, partnerships and collaborative pedagogic platforms help to enhance cross/inter/trans-disciplinary urban pedagogy and urbanism? How can innovative comparative frameworks be composed through urban pedagogy to engender a more globally relevant urban education? In what ways can study trips and overseas fieldwork contribute to challenging assumptions about the generalisability of urban knowledge and practice? Can student exchanges, including those undertaken through digital platforms or online, help to develop new forms of urban theory and practice? How do partnerships in international urban education work? To what extent are they partnerships of equivalence? How are reciprocal international relationships in education in the built environment best forged? What can current initiatives to internationalise urban training learn from the history of 'internationalisation' in urban education, including the role of imperial, neoliberal and developmental policy networks in shaping urban education? What roles do universities play in the politics and practices of urban development? How can international collaborative and comparative approaches to urban education support the development of more ethical models for university-city relations? What urban practices and priorities have university built environment course design, marketing, and recruitment strategies emphasised in responding to the challenges of internationalization?

181,Call for Proposals: Open Source Housing crisis,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2015/feb/call-proposals-open-source-housing-crisis,3 February 2015,"Those in need are often forced to accept precarious dwelling conditions, in buildings that are poorly designed, cheaply constructed and disadvantageously financed. The political and financial structures, such as the mis-alignment of average wages to the GLA's interpretations of 'affordability' and predominance of insecure tenancies, that fuel London's housing crisis continue to evolve beneath the radar of public scrutiny.ActionWe are convening a workshop concerned to scope communication technologies with potential to disrupt these conditions. This workshop is concerned with the design of network-based tools that would nurture a many-to-many approach to 1) better understanding and engagement with policy changes and relevant expertise; 2) experimenting with alternative models that destabalise the central role of the developer / housing association in decision making about the future of housing in London.OutcomeThe outcome of this workshop will be a special issue of the Urban Pamphleteer. Our starting vision for this is a catalogue of transformative tools, tactics, and ideas from a variety of perspectives featuring contributions by select workshop participants. Urban Pamphleteer is a series of publications that confront key contemporary urban questions from diverse perspectives. Issues are distributed for free in print and digitally. Urban Pamphleteer is a collaboration between Central Saint Martins and the UCL Urban Laboratory.ParticipateThe workshop takes place on 13 March 2015 (10.00-16.30) at Central Saint Martins in the Graphic Communication Design studios and runs as part of CSM's Restless Futures Events Series. Confirmed participants so far include Joel Gethin Lewis, Adam Greenfield, and Dawn Foster. Lunch and refreshments will be provided, but please note that we are unable to cover additional costs.We would like to hear from anyone who thinks they might have a contribution to make to this workshop. If you are interested, please send an e-mail to Shauna Scott (s.scott@csm.arts.ac.uk) and include a 100 word expression of interest that indicates something about your background and reason for wanting to get involved by 16 February. We will select approximately 18 participants representing a wide range of concerns and disciplines.

Designed by Dr. Rebecca Ross (Central Saint Martins and co-series editor, Urban Pamphleteer), the project looks to capture voices from a range of Londoners who are considering moving to/within/away from London, and those who already have. Using the web form, participants are asked a series of questions intended to capture a variety of personal stories and circumstances. These will enhance understanding of broader demographic trends concerning migration into, out of, and around London. An edited selection of responses to the web form will be displayed on digital billboards in Central London during February 2015. The billboards present a unique opportunity for individual voices that might normally be left unheard to be featured prominently in two of the busiest areas of Central London, Holborn and Aldgate. Data will be collected throughout the 2015 calendar year. However, since access to the digital billboards is during February only, engagement during this period is crucial to getting as diverse a range of participants. The success of this project is contingent on the level of participation. Make sure to share londonischanging.org and participate."

London: Aspects of Change was the result of work by the Centre for Urban Studies at University College London (UCL), established in 1958 and led by Ruth Glass. The Centre contributed to 'the systematic knowledge of urban development, structure and society, and to link academic social research with social policy'. As such, it was strongly cross-disciplinary, although archives of the Centre are surprisingly limited. The book brought together ten chapters by sociologists, geographers, planners, historians and health scientists to sketch a general social profile of a city that had undergone rapid contemporary change. In the audio below, a number of academics explore how the arguments, details and rationale within London: Aspects of Change are still relevant to thinking about and exploring twenty-first-century London. It marks just over fifty years since Aspects of Change was published. The speakers investigate aspects of how London has changed - or not - over the half-century since the analyses and predictions were made in this book. Issues such as high-density housing, race relations, metropolitan governance, land values, transport access, and not least gentrification continue to play a major role in cross-disciplinary debates and discussions on London's contemporary transformations and its future aspirations.

Water lies at the intersection of landscape and infrastructure, crossing between visible and invisible domains of urban space, in the tanks and buckets of the global South and the vast subterranean technological networks of the global North. In this book, Matthew Gandy (UCL Geography and UCL Urban Laboratory Director 2005-2011) considers the cultural and material significance of water through the experiences of six cities: Paris, Berlin, Lagos, Mumbai, Los Angeles, and London. Tracing the evolving relationships among modernity, nature, and the urban imagination, from different vantage points and through different periods, Gandy uses water as a lens through which to observe both the ambiguities and the limits of nature as conventionally understood. The book can be purchased through the publishers website. UCL will host a book launch in January 2015. More information will be announced in due course."

The theme for this year's conference, run by the National Co-Ordinating Centre for Public Engagement, which helps universities engage with the public, is 'Captivating places; Captivating ideas; Captivating people: Unlocking the potential of curiosity-driven engagement'. The workshop will compare and explore the different approaches taken by university institutions - UCL, Manchester and Cambridge - to engaging with stakeholders of various kinds on their spatial development projects, emphasising the embedded nature of the institutional presence in physical place and space. It will present UCL's research and community engagement work relating to the plans for UCL East, and Beacon Bursary-funded public workshop around data visualisation in Brixton. It will contrast these approaches with Manchester's environmental sustainability initiative, Living Lab, run by Andy Karvonen, and University of Cambridge's public art strategy at its North West Cambridge development, co-ordinated by Sam Wilkinson. It is hoped the workshop will attract a mix of public engagement professionals and estates professionals from other universities as well as community partners and academics working in the field of urban regeneration, alongside external stakeholders, as well as those directly involved in visioning, planning and evaluating new campus initiatives within their own institutions.

193,How images shape our cities: UCL Urban Laboratory launches Picturing Place with Guardian Cities,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2014/dec/how-images-shape-our-cities-ucl-urban-laboratory-launches-picturing-place-guardian,1 December 2014,"The series surveys the ways that images shape cities and influence perceptions of place. It features ten articles, to be published daily, on exemplar images that have had powerful effects - looking across different places, periods and media, including maps, plans, photographs, renders, computer generated images, street art and signage. It begins by interrogating the role of architect Oscar Niemeyer's conceptual sketch in the creation of Brazil's capital city, Brasilla. Drawing on the research project, Picturing Place, the series highlights unexpected relationships across images and observes the influential role that visual languages play in struggles over urban space. It also opens a space for the public to debate, share and discuss images that have impacted on cities or are currently shaping them Dr Ben Campkin, Director of UCL Urban Laboratory and one of the research collaborators said: 'Picturing Place aims to encourage discussion amongst a wide range of urban citizens and practitioners about the roles that visual languages have in the production of the built environment, and the interactive relationships between images and cities. We're trying to create awareness of how images encountered on the street are an important aspect of larger power struggles over the future of the city'. 'The question we are asking with this research is whether a more critically rigorous approach to images in built environment discourse could lead to better and more transparent decision making, and representation of a greater range of people, in the production of cities. The articles can be viewed here: Intro - How images shape our cities 1 - The iconic origins of Brazil's capital city 2 - The architects of apartheid 3 - Dubai's Palm Jumeirah islands only look like palm trees from space - but that doesn't matter 4 - This 'hero shot' of Shanghai's future skyline projects China's success 5 - Ebenezer Howard's three magnets Assignment - Neighbourhood murals: share your pictures and stories 6 - Chicago's Wall of Respect: how a mural elicited a sense of collective ownership 7 - The symbolic simplicity of Mexico City's metro signs 8 - Pruitt Igoe: Blowing up this St Louis housing project was easier than demolishing the myth it created 9 - London's post-war reconstruction plan promised 'new order and dignity' 10 - 'There's land if you want it': how a hand-drawn map is transforming vacant lots in Brooklyn Readers' pictures - The best neighbourhood murals around the world - readers' pictures Gallery - The ten best murals Further information Picturing Place is an interdisciplinary research project that critically explores the role of images, image-production, and image-circulation, in urban change. The starting point for the research is to consider how images of cities - e.g. plans, maps, renderings of projected future spaces - and images in cities - e.g. billboards, community murals - influence urban change and perceptions of place. The goal is to develop a methodology that demands more from images. The research collaborators are Dr Ben Campkin (Senior Lecturer at UCL Bartlett School of Architecture and Director of the Urban Laboratory), Dr Mariana Mogilevich (Mellon Fellow in Architecture, Urbanism, and the Humanities at Princeton University), and Dr Rebecca Ross (Senior Lecturer and MA Course Leader in Graphic Communication Design at Central Saint Martins)."

195,Urban Pamphleteer #4: Doha Launch,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2014/nov/urban-pamphleteer-4-doha-launch,18 November 2014,"The potential role of higher education in 'activating' city centres all over the world, as opposed to generating conflict between 'town and gown', was highlighted at the launch on Sunday of UCL Urban Laboratory's Urban Pamphleteer #4, dedicated to issues around the rapid redevelopment of the historic centre of Doha, Qatar. The event, held at Doha's most recognizable landmark, the Museum of Islamic Art, concluded with a presentation from Tim Makower, a British architect based in London and Doha, who stated 'there is a real opportunity for higher education to activate old Doha. Experience tells us that urban mixed use, cultural heritage, and education are mutually beneficial'. Makower, who played a central role in the masterplanning and design of Doha's fast emerging Msheireb Downtown development, was also the driving force behind the Old Doha Prize (2013) organised in Doha in collaboration with the British Council, UCL's Bartlett School of Architecture, the RIBA, and Qatar Museums Authority. The competition, which paired selected Qatari and British collaborators, asked teams to make proposals for a sustainable, heritage-led regeneration strategy for the Al Asmakh neighourhood on the boundary of the Msheireb development. The fate of this neighbourhood, comprising narrow streets of dilapidated old mudbrick courtyard houses, small local shops, and some newer structures, inhabited by a long-standing, recently evicted, community of Doha's migrant workers from Nepal, India and Sri Lanka, had been under question for some time. The winning team, youandme architecture from the UK, with Fatima Fawzy and Alaa Larri from Qatar, came up with a strategy for sensitive redevelopment which puts education at its heart. The hope is that Qatar's planning authority and government officials will be influenced to produce plans for the Al Asmakh area, now an exclusion zone marked off by barriers, which take some of these ideas on board. Urban planning in Doha has been dominated by a zoning-based approach for many decades, resulting in a highly segregated city where residential areas, shopping and leisure zones, and commerce occupy clearly bounded territorial areas. Doha's higher education facilities are concentrated in two principal zones, that of Qatar University near West Bay business area, and the newer, ever-expanding, Education City campus - a 20-40 minute drive from the centre depending on the traffic, with no public transport links. Education City includes a number of 'branch campuses' of mainly US universities, plus UCL Qatar, a postgraduate centre for studies in heritage, museums, and archaeology, as well as Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, and the Qatar Foundation. It is co-located with Qatar Science and Technology Park, where it is hoped that university-generated research will undergo commercial application. It is also the home of Qatar Academy, an all-through school geared towards university entrance, the Qatar National Library, a stadium, and extensive residential student accommodation. The Education City campus is notable for its pleasant, peaceful gardens and open spaces, a collection of remarkable buildings designed by top-ranking architects such as Legorreta, Koolhaas, and Isozaki, and a wide-ranging programme of educational and cultural events. Qatar University is also architecturally noteworthy, designed by El Kafrawi, recipient of an Aga Kahn award - and currently expanding on its own campus. But both sites lie at a distance from the city centre, drawing both people and teaching and research-related activity out of it. Both Makower and the Old Doha prize winners, speaking at the Urban Pamphleteer launch, agreed that the current regeneration of the city centre could benefit greatly from a re-integration of 'town and gown', animating the central areas with a range of education-related activities at the core of a new mixed-use approach to development, leavening the historic emphasis on city-centre business and retail: 'Student life and education have a proven track record to regenerating areas. They can also enable a step-by-step regeneration that adapts to its socio-economic context. In Doha, zoned areas such as Education City and Katara Cultural Village, positioned on the edge of the city, take away a lot of life and activity from the centre. Why not have these activities happening right at the heart of Old Doha?' (Alicja Borkowska, youandme architecture).

Design & Trust launched during Cities Methodologies 2014 on Thursday 30 October in an event hosted by series editors Ben Campkin (UCL Urban Laboratory) and Rebecca Ross (Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design), and including a number of this issue's contributors presenting their own research and take on the theme. The issue questions the role and effects of security-driven spatial design, and raising this generally side-lined perspective of physical architecture as a strategy in crime prevention and surveillance. With a focus on specific designs or spaces, the contributors address contested sites and tensions created within public environments; from obvious and apparent devices such as city railings described by Matthew Ingleby, to invisible or ambiguous techniques, as explored photographically by Max Colson and drawn on also by Alistair Steele in his article on ATM cashpoint design. Depicting designs and spatial manipulations as both securing and controlling the public and their actions, contributors tackle the effectiveness of such strategies, and also point towards the idea of a need for new design strategies based on trust as opposed to distrust. Inviting dialogue and debate around incentives of such spatial and architectural design and its intended shaping of the public, the Design & Trust issue raises important questions around public space as shaped by strategy, and ultimately physical design as having powerful, sometimes subversive implications upon our daily actions and navigations in space. Contributors include: Matthew Ingleby, Anne Bottomley & Nathan Moore, Lorraine Gamman & Adam Thorpe, Johan Andersson, Max Colson, Stamatis Zografos, Samir Singh, Henrietta Williams, Jonathan Gardner, Thireshen Govender & Andrew Charman, Tilly Fowler & Anna Hart, Alistair Steele, and Michele Acuto.

Max Colson's performative photographic practice dramatises the use of security features in public space, questioning how design engenders feelings of safety or a sense of individual or collective distrust. The project aims to heighten viewers' awareness of the way that security design, surveillance and paranoia interact within the urban environment. They also use humour to emphasise the limits of photographs as documentary evidence and suggest the influence of human bias on photojournalistic investigation, questioning issues around surveillance and security design in relation to the credibility of the investigation itself. The Leverhulme Trust provides grants and scholarships for research and education across academic disciplines, supporting talented individuals in the arts, humanities, sciences and social sciences to realise their personal vision in research and professional training.  This follows the previous academic year artist residency based at UCL Urban Laboratory by Rab Harling, also funded by the Leverhulme Trust, for the project Inversion/Reflection: Turning Balfron Tower Inside Out.

It will be used for the project, 'Making sense of digital data' - inclusive visualisation workshops as a component of participatory urban regeneration in Brixton. Research Associate Clare Melhuish will work with colleagues in ICRI Cities at UCL (Han Pham, Christian Jetter, and Lisa Koeman), and the Brixton Green community benefit society, to organise two inclusive workshops for local residents at Somerleyton Road, Brixton. The workshops will provide participants with an opportunity to engage with and visualise digital data relating to air quality generated by two bespoke sensors mounted at the site. This will be used as an entry point to local environmental data collection over time, and in order to engage residents in a more tangible way in changes taking place at the site. The workshops will form part of the process of community engagement and participation in the ongoing community-led urban regeneration project led by Brixton Green, Lambeth Council and Ovalhouse Theatre. The results will be presented at a street fair in Somerleyton Road on June 26th. The initiative is intended to promote data literacy in the urban environment, and an understanding of what it might mean to be a 'smart citizen' in the context of urban regeneration debates."

Highlights include a seminar on the life and work of Ruth Glass, the UCL sociologist who 50 years ago coined the influential term 'gentrification', drawing together scholars who knew or were taught by her. Cross-disciplinary groups of researchers and practitioners will also present novel approaches to heritage, as the built environment takes on new social, cultural and economic importance as a repository of collective memory - in tension with the increasing threat of erasure through new development. Emerging scholars and artists will lead ground-breaking critical guided walks through London, focusing on the City, the River Fleet and King's Cross, and explicitly reflecting on walking as a way of better understanding cities and urban experience.Dr Ben Campkin, Director of UCL Urban Laboratory, comments:""For the past six years, as an experimental space for presenting new methods, Cities Methodologies has hosted an exciting array of events and installations, fostering radical and rigorous cross-disciplinary urban research.This year, leading scholars, built environment practitioners, community groups, artists, writers and others will collaborate to produce new ideas and develop new methods focused on the most pressing urban questions - from the relationship between housing and wellbeing, to the definition of cultural heritage, to the history and study of gentrification - engaging with cities worldwide.""Cities Methodologies events are free to attend, with some requiring pre-registration. Three installations - on architecture and fire, urban walking and the photography of Balfron House - will be open throughout the week from 10am to 6pm in the Slade Research Centre.

It is available to listen to on the BBC iPlayer until Tuesday 8 April via this link. The programme takes the form of a despatch from the future, sketching out the contours of independent London in 2030 - an affluent country with more liberal attitudes, and far more diverse, transient population than Britain, but with a lopsided economy all too dependent on financial services and an increasingly hollowed-out society.

210,Ben Campkin on Derek Jarman's King's Cross in 3:AM Magazine,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2014/mar/ben-campkin-derek-jarmans-kings-cross-3am-magazine,6 March 2014,"The talk introduced footage of King's Cross made by Jarman and his collaborators for the Pet Shop Boys. These images comprised a promo for 'Rent' (1987) and a later Super 8 film that was made to be back-projected during the Pet Shop Boys' 1989 tour as they performed the track 'King's Cross'. Completed before the King's Cross tube station fire (November 1987) the song uses the area as a downbeat emblem of Margaret Thatcher's Britain, around the time that media hysteria on the AIDS crisis peaked. The elegiac footage imbues an everyday city space with poetic tension, echoing the track's sense of suspension and disorientation. The essay can be read on 3:AM Magazine here. The Derek Jarman: Sites and Spaces study day also included talks with Alan Hollinghurst (Author, The Swimming-Pool Library; The Line of Beauty), Henry Miller (film historian and critic), Dr Hilary Powell (artist and AHRC Fellow, UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Richard Maguire (Lecturer, Arcadia University in London), Professor Jonathan Hill (architect, academic and author), Dr Bob Mills (UCL History of Art), Nigel Green (photographer), and Professor Stephen Farthing RA (Co-editor, Derek Jarman's Sketchbooks).

His talk titled 'Gray Space and the New Urban Regime: Between Liberalism and a Creeping Apartheid', focused on the causes of what he terms as 'gray spaces' - the unregulated urbanisation of people who are neither integrated into nor eliminated from society, are on the fringes and grey areas of legality and at the will of metropolitan politics. Introduced by editor-in-chief of CITY Journal, Bob Catterall, Professor Yiftachel focused largely on the Israel-Palestine region as a site of marginalisation of 'unwanted' communities.  Jerusalem is an obvious metropolitan example of this - once among the most cosmopolitan of world cities, a wall now physically divides it, drawing a line between different groups of people. Professor Yiftachel explained that this was a wasted opportunity for planners, arguing that the spirit of planning (both in the city and in rural areas) is to make society better. For Palestinians, planning is now seen as an expression of oppression. He contended that 'wild capitalism' and the growth of socio-political urbanisation were contributing to this creeping apartheid in other cities too, largely in the developing south and east, and to an extent, the west. The Bedouin village was given as an example of gray spacing's 'permanent temporariness' - the management of unwanted or irremovable communities in a system designed to cater exclusively for the wanted or untameable. Professor Yiftachel presented the case of implementing Israeli metropolitan planning over a Bedouin area which triggered a response from the Bedouin community with a counter-planning initiative. He described unregulated housing projects, largely in the Middle East, as something between the 'lightness' of legality and safety, and the 'darkness' of eviction, destruction and death. He remarked that this shows ""we are in neo-colonialism, not post-colonialism."" He concluded by reciting lyrics from an Arab-Israeli rapper Tamer Nafar. Translated from Arabic, it focused on the political situation for gray space (""Cos' the Gov has a wish / Max Arabs on minimum land / And min Jews on max land"") and the legal implications (""Yes, my shack never received any approval / But NO, you will not live to see my removal""). Dr. Camillo Boano (Development Planning Unit) acted as a respondent, followed by a brief Q&A with the audience. For reading on the concept of 'gray space' and the significance of Oren Yiftachel's work, please follow the link for free access to this paper by Marcela Lopes de Souza entitled 'Marxists, libertarians and the city: a necessary debate' (CITY, June 2012, 16.3).

215,Urban Pamphleteer #3: Design and Trust Call for Contributions,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2014/jan/urban-pamphleteer-3-design-and-trust-call-contributions,23 January 2014,"Each illustrated pamphlet in this series collates and presents expert voices across disciplines, professions, and community groups around one pressing contemporary urban challenge. The intention is to draw out and confront the complexities of each subject from diverse perspectives, in a direct and accessible-but not reductive or didactic-tone. In the tradition of radical pamphleteering, the broader aim is to empower citizens and inform professionals, organisations, institutions and policy-makers, with a view to actively influencing urban debate and positively shaping change. The pamphlets are being economically produced, carefully designed and widely circulated, both as hard copy and digitally. The first issues have been published. Urban Pamphleteer #1 Future & Smart Cities (April 2013) Urban Pamphleteer #2 Regeneration Realities (December 2013) We are now soliciting contributions of 400-800 words and/or images/visual essays for Urban Pamphleteer #3: Design and Trust. This issue aims to stimulate a critical discussion about the role of design in ensuring safety-often indistinguishable from perceptions of safety-and facilitating trust, in urban environments. Contributions are invited that consider the history and contexts in which defensible space, crime prevention through environmental design and other 'design against crime' strategies emerged in different places; and which examine the ways these strategies became embedded in a range of legal, policy, regulatory, community and practice frameworks. The aim of the issue is to understand and critically engage with the assumptions and evidence on which such theories have been based, their intended and unintended effects, their physical imprint on cities, likely future scenarios and alternative approaches. What are the consequences of prioritising defence and security as a first principle in design? What forces-social, professional, commercial, technological-have shaped such strategies? Where have they actually prevented or reduced crime, or promoted feelings of safety, security and responsibility, and where may they have jeopardised trust or sociability or eroded potentials for public life? New perspectives on these themes might include, for example, projects that document, contextualise and comment on existing design features and urban practices associated with security and crime prevention, as well as those that enhance public life by fostering trust and an inclusive sense of community in the public realm. Submissions to Urban Pamphleteer are peer reviewed and edited by a small team of series and individual issue editors. We are looking to select approximately 15 contributions that directly address one or more of the questions or issues above. In making the final selection, we will be looking to feature the widest possible range of perspectives, through high quality writing and images, with ideas presented rigorously and accessibly. Space is limited by our budget-so we encourage concise and incisive texts and even single-image contributions. Please have a look at Urban Pamphleteer #1 and #2 to get an idea of the overall format. If you would like to propose a text or image or visual project please send us a 150 word proposal by Monday 10 February 2014 5pm within the body of an e-mail to urbanlaboratory@ucl.ac.uk. Contributors will need to be in a position to submit final copy by 10 March. You must own the copyright for any text or material submitted (which you will retain).

216,New 'Change by Design' report now available,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2014/jan/new-change-design-report-now-available,21 January 2014,"A new report based on the findings of an Architecture Sans Frontières UK (ASF-UK) Change by Design workshop in Ecuador, 'Nueva Imaginaciones Espaciales en Los Pinos' is now available. The report outlines the findings of a 2-week workshop that took place in Quito in August 2013, resulting from a collaboration between ASF-UK, Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, El Institute de Altos Estudios Nacionales (IAEN) and the Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario 'Los Pinos', with the support of The Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU) and the research project Scarcity and Creativity in the Built Environment (SCIBE). The report is in Spanish and aimed at communicating findings to local residents and contributing towards discussions in Ecuador on the issue. The workshop was coordinated by Alexandre Apsan Frediani (UCL Development Planning Unit and UCL Urban Laboratory Steering Committee), Beatrice De Carli (Bartlett Visiting Research Fellow at the DPU and UCL Urban Laboratory), Isis Nuñez Ferrera (DPU alumni, PhD candidate Westminster University) and  Naomi Shinkins (ASF-UK Associate). The workshop was aimed at defining cross-scalar design options for the future upgrading of Los Pinos, a peri-urban informal settlement located in the municipality of Mejia, south of Quito. Based on the exploration of residents' spatial practices and imaginations, the workshop investigated ways in which present occupiers can be meaningfully involved in an integrated design/development process as active agents of change, rather than beneficiaries of top-down visions and spatial solutions. The workshop carried out a series of activities to facilitate a participatory articulation of residents' layered needs and aspirations, which aims to contribute to the elaboration of an open-ended, neighbourhood-wide development strategy. Such practices of participatory design, called Change by Design (CbD), aim to contribute to on-going debates about democratizing the production of spaces in Quito and therefore contribute to the realization of the national development agenda 'Buen Vivir' (Good Living) in an urban context and pursue goals expressed at the 'Contrato Social por la Vivienda' (2005). After the workshop, two participants continued working in Los Pinos as ASF-UK interns for five months, supporting the elaboration of the community management plan that is needed in the process of tenure regularisation. The interns were supervised by the team from Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, who since the workshop has set up a technical assistance group to support Los Pinos' residents, and who will be continuing to work alongside the community once the interns finish their engagement. ASF-UK and DPU hope to keep supporting this process remotely and in future visits, with the objective of exploring the role of this case in realising the 'Buen Vivir' agenda in the urban context.

This major five-year cross-disciplinary project involves the employment of three postdoctoral researchers and two doctoral students to study forms of urban nature in Berlin, Chennai, London and Tallinn. The idea behind this ground-breaking project is to challenge existing understandings of urban nature using an innovative interdisciplinary framework in a comparative international context. The project provides a new theoretical approach that moves beyond existing research to provide a novel synthesis between advances in urban ecology and original insights into cultural and political dimensions to the production of urban space. The core hypothesis is that in order to understand the dynamics of urban nature we must link the independent agency of nature with a renewed urban environmental history that takes full account of changing conceptions of human subjectivity, the ideological dimensions to scientific metaphors, and the need to develop new critical engagements with the global South. The emphasis of the research will be on spontaneous forms of urban nature such as wastelands and other spaces that emerge at the intersections between cities and bio-physical processes. These will be studied through a range of innovative methods that researchers at the Urban Laboratory have been developing in previous cross-disciplinary work on urban nature, including film-making, oral history, site surveys and collaborations with artists, underpinned by critical theoretical scholarship. Further details will be posted on the Urban Laboratory's website in due course."

Designed by renowned architect Ernö Goldfinger, Balfron Tower is a 27-storey tower block, situated in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Conceived and built to alleviate slum-dwelling, this 'Brutalist' concrete structure was recently saved from demolition by its Grade-II listed status, and is currently the focus of 'regeneration'. This will be accompanied by a fundamental change to the building's original function of social housing provision. To fund its restoration, Balfron's housing association owner will sell off the refurbished flats, completing its transformation to private ownership. As the tower enters the final phase of its life prior to refurbishment, developing his photographic works in collaboration with housing experts at UCL, Rab will record this pivotal moment. He will represent the building's final occupation by long-term social housing tenants, its use by newer short-term occupants, the gradual process of 'decanting' and dispersal, and the building's reoccupation as private housing. Rab Harling specialises in experimental large-format photography and photographic installations. He investigates how people construct a sense of place in urban environments. Film industry trained, with extensive expertise in large-format and low-level light techniques, Rab turned to fine-art photography in 2006. Following an MA (2010), he has exhibited in the UK and overseas, including 'Reports from an Ordinary Satellite', curated by Val Williams (Rhubarb International Photography Festival/Galerie Der Fachhochschule, Germany 2010), and large-scale installations (Tower Hamlets Spring Open, Mile End Art Pavilion 2011/12). He has recently presented a solo exhibition of his ongoing project 'A Delicate Sense of Terror' at Lubomirov-Easton in London. Image: Rab Harling "

Over the last four decades Harvey has illuminated a new geographical and cultural understanding of the way capitalism operates. Beyond his extraordinary scholarly contributions however perhaps what is equally remarkable is the public reach of his writing and teaching. David Harvey's recent online lecture courses and interventions not only reassert the legacy of Marx's theory, his work inspires something quite new - a spirit of autodidactism, organic learning and a sense that the public realm is a field of education and political optimism. Prior to David's talk Louis Moreno of UCL's Urban Laboratory considered some of the ways in which David's body of work provides a fresh starting point for a creative and practical response to a new era of civil unrest and geo-political uncertainty. Following David's talk there was a Q&A chaired by Professor Jeremy Till, Head of Central Saint Martins. A podcast of the event is available here.

231,Apps and urban space: call for interviewees,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2013/may/apps-and-urban-space-call-interviewees,31 May 2013,"His research focuses on the apps' spatial qualities and their effect on users' identities. Mappiness and Grindr users are sought out to participate in a short, confidential interview, to get a wider scope on the way the apps are used, how they relate to urban space, and how their users construct virtual personas. In the case of Grindr, the research also explores how Grindr-users perceive their sexual identity/orientation in relation to urban spaces.  The interview involves one session lasting approximately 30-40  minutes and will take place at UCL or at public space in London, such as the Royal Festival Hall, but participants are welcome to select the location which best suits them. The confidential findings from the interviews will be used to design an event as part of the PhD. If you are interested in confidentially taking part, or would like to know more about the study or the apps, please send an email to regner.ramos.11[at]ucl.ac.uk or visit http://ucl-research.tumblr.com for more information."

236,Margit Mayer paper in CITY journal,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2013/mar/margit-mayer-paper-city-journal,25 March 2013,"An article based on this talk is published in volume 17, issue 1 of CITY journal. Abstract: The paper looks at contemporary urban activism as it mobilizes around policies and conflicts characteristic of the comparatively privileged Western cities of the global North. It first analyzes the particularities of neoliberal urbanism and its implications for (divisions between) urban social movements, and secondly looks at how today's movements might move beyond their current predicaments, which lie in the tensions between more and less privileged movement groups occupying rather different strategic positions. Corresponding to the widespread trend of creative city politics, a sector of urban movements has flourished that benefits from innovative policies fostering alternative and (sub)cultural activism; on the other hand, various movements mobilizing around the intensifying trends of austerity urbanism have largely remained at a distance from leftist, autonomous and countercultural movements. The divides are beginning to be bridged in new forms of (post-)Occupy collaborations that bring together austerity victims and other groups of urban 'outcasts' with (frequently middle-class-based) radical activists, allowing both to acknowledge their differences. This, it is argued, constitutes a necessary condition for struggles against the exclusivity of neoliberal urbanism to be effective."

During August and September 2012, the DPU summerLabs were held in Zurich and in Rome. In Zurich DPU summerLab saw the exploration of renewed ways of 'mapping' and 'interpreting' as a gesture of complex lines of movement, a series of spatial storytelling along the edges of the spaces that contains it, creating, like in a musical plot, a sequence of distinct intervals of silence, emptiness and thresholds. DPU summerLab in Zurich tried to understand the Langstrasse Quarter and the Altstetten site across a package of thematic notions: visibility, thresholds, juxtaposition, inheritance, temporary, and public as potentially reconfiguring elements for mapping the phenomenological characteristics of these areas that lead to the interpretation of potential tactics and interventions of a spatial design thinking. Link to Zurich publication. In Rome, for the second year DPU summerLab had the privilege of being exposed to the rich political galaxy of squat-occupations spaces network in Rome. Guided by extremely committed activists, citizens and friends, the participants were exposed to the challenges and the potentialities of the ""act of occupying"", from memorable personal narrative of inclusiveness to the making and remaking of anti-entropic and anti-obsolescing spaces. DPU summerLab in Rome took place mainly in Porto Fluviale, a squat-occupation whose community is currently building on its complex past to re-write a different future: for its space, for its city. A new Porto Fluviale, the ""piazza del Porto Fluviale"" made possible to invert the processes that has formed the occupation - emptiness and obsolescence - through an act of opening and re-programming.

In this article, I propose studying these plans as cosmograms, this is, as diagrams of the entities and the relationships among entities articulating a common urban cosmos. By following the work of experts involved in their elaboration, I describe and discuss the establishment of 'common boundaries' regarding the territories and entities representing common matters of concern, and the transformation of urban projects into 'common things', ie. projects that give form to this world by means of a surplus of connections to other entities. I also look in detail at how master plans are aimed to act upon the world. Thus, by taking their existence as PowerPoints seriously, I show how master plans operate as resources for action in the present rather than for the structuration of the future. Michael Guggenheim: Sacralizing and De-Sacralizing Buildings. Notes on the Theory of Technology What does a church do? What do mosques do? Constructivist sociology has usually argued that buildings don't do anything, but are enacted by users. Conversely, actor-network theory has interpreted buildings as actants that are stabilised by architect-controlled networks. In this article, I attempt a theory, which uses these opposing ideas about the agency of buildings in an ethnographic way, by observing how buildings do different theories in different situations. I use two different kinds of change of use to show that buildings do different things. First, I show that in the case of churches that are changed to other uses, the church attempts to associate the buildings to religion primarily with discursive means.  Second, I show that in the case of factories that are turned into mosques, very small material interventions with furniture I close with some observations of the relationship of buildings and power. *Please circulate this notice to interested people (they can register for notices on the website www.theurbansalon.org), and feel free to bring along some snacks or drinks to fortify informal discussions after the talks. About the The Urban Salon The Urban Salon is a London based seminar series aimed at scholars, artists, practitioners and others who are exploring urban experiences within an international and comparative frame. The seminars are informal and open, with relatively short presentations supporting circulated or visual material and plenty of time for discussion. We want to allow the diversity of urban experiences in different contexts to inform thinking about cities; we hope that narratives taken-for-granted in one context will disturb and be disrupted by experiences in other places. Or that accounts of the circulations of people and practices will expose commonalities across apparently quite divergent contexts. All the while, we want to decentre the dominance of European and North American urban experiences in understanding urbanity, while keeping them in sight, but coming to them through a wider world of cities and urban experience. We welcome suggestions for future events. Please contact one of the organizers."

But with the rise of austerity as a political agenda, the downsizing of the state poses significant tests for a continued emphasis on urban creativity in stimulating growth and rejuvenating urban communities. Creative City Limits is a new UCL Urban Laboratory pamphlet that considers the urban and cultural impact of the new era of austerity, and questions the ambiguous social and political assumptions of 'creative city' policy making.  Aiming to provide a concise and provocative summary of contemporary debates currently underway in academia, the authors outline ways that the notion of the creative city might be challenged and reformulated in light of current economic difficulties and new social priorities.

It will be suggested that the theoretical synthesis represented by queer ecology serves to expand the conceptual and material scope of both fields: queer theory is revealed to have only a partially developed engagement with urban nature whilst critical strands of urban ecology such as urban political ecology have yet to connect in a systematic way with queer theory, posthumanism, or new conceptions of complexity emerging from within the science of ecology itself. It is concluded that queer ecology may enrich our understanding of both urban materiality and the role of metaphors in urban theory. In particular, the idea of queer ecology illuminates the possibility for site-specific 'heterotopic alliances' in the contemporary city. https://doi.org/10.1068/d10511"

251,UCL's Stratford proposition,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2012/oct/ucls-stratford-proposition,23 October 2012,"The London Borough of Newham's Cabinet will this week consider UCL's proposition to develop a university quarter in Stratford on the site of the Carpenters Estate, currently occupied by 318 households. The UCL Urban Laboratory has not been involved in the development of the proposals. However, some staff associated with the Urban Laboratory have had meetings with the team who have developed UCL's vision document, in order to emphasise the need for the estate's residents and other community groups to lead discussions regarding the future of their estate and neighbourhood. At a public meeting held on the estate on 24 September the Carpenters Joint Residents Steering Group - a body of residents including a mix of tenants, leaseholders and freeholders, with representatives from the Tenant Management Organisation and CARP - voted to adopt a statement which opposes a UCL-led development on the basis of a range of concerns regarding the proposals UCL had at that time presented to them. Drawing on the research of scholars connected with the Urban Laboratory, and on evidence from wider urban studies scholarship, we contend that ethical regeneration is only possible if community-led. That would mean, in this case, empowering both the on-site and wider Newham communities, and listening to and responding to residents' objections. We strongly urge UCL to undertake such negotiations - as has been agreed by the UCL Council in correspondence with residents. The wider UCL community has so far not been involved in the decision to pursue this new development. If Newham and UCL decide to proceed to develop the proposals further, an open debate will ensue, and UCL has made a commitment that during this time residents and other community groups, and UCL staff and students, will be able to engage seriously in the discussions regarding a potential UCL-led development. This will provide further opportunities to draw on UCL's wide-ranging world-leading research on housing, regeneration, and community participation in urban development to ensure that any regeneration proposed or undertaken by UCL is ethical and follows sustainable principles. Note: A diverse range of UCL staff members and students are associated with the UCL Urban Laboratory. This statement reflects the views of the Urban Laboratory Steering Committee, but individuals may take different standpoints on the UCL Stratford proposals.

The current crisis is caused and exacerbated by a combination of factors such as an increase in population and in numbers of households, planning restrictions on urban expansion, rising rents and house prices driven up by the credit boom, added pressures on household incomes from the economic downturn, inequalities in access to housing, a decline of the affordable housing stock, and the reinforcement of the general trend to exclude lower to middle income households from living in central London. The problem of creating adequate homes for a growing demand is not new. On 27 and 28 June 2013 the Centre for Metropolitan History (Institute of Historical Research, University of London), in association with the Survey of London (English Heritage) and the UCL Urban Laboratory, will hold a two day conference to explore issues relating to the history of urban or suburban housing from the mid-19th century to the present day. Keynote speakers will include Professor Andrew Saint (Survey of London, English Heritage) and Professor Jerry White (Birkbeck). The conference will seek to examine the history of housing provision in London, and how historical research may be mobilised to address the contemporary crisis. Contributions from other major cities that make direct comparisons with London are also welcomed. To date, research on the history of housing has often remained in the silos of particular disciplines. Academics from a range of fields, as well as professionals, politicians, journalists and activists have developed their own methods to research the subject from their own particular perspectives. The aim of this conference is to bring together delegates from different disciplines to stimulate exchange of knowledge and discussion, encouraging cross-disciplinary approaches from various fields, including but not limited to urban studies, architecture, economics, planning, and urban geography. The conference will consider past approaches to housing provision, both from the state and the private sector, and their relevance to the understanding and improvement of models of housing development today. The conference organisers invite proposals for papers or presentations of 20 minutes in length. Submissions are welcomed on any subject related to the general theme. Topics may include, for example: Planning and Design • Roles of developers, planners, architects, builders, users • Role of government, regulations and policies • Increasing density, provision of amenities • Conservation and conversion of existing buildings Development and Finance • Speculation, financing of developments • Modes of occupation, i.e. renting, ownership • Productivity, low cost housing • Community land trusts Cultural and Social • Everyday life and experiences, i.e. high rise living, local identity • Gentrification • Migrations • Crime and 'design against crime' • Regeneration • Marketing and the language of housing Please send abstracts and an author biography (including institutional affiliation) each of no more than 250 words by 14 December 2012 by email to the Centre for Metropolitan History at ihrcmh@sas.ac.uk. The call for papers is open to both established and early career researchers."
253,Stadtkolloquium 2013 Call for Papers,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2012/oct/stadtkolloquium-2013-call-papers,10 October 2012,"Stadtkolloquium, in conjunction with UCL's Urban Laboratory, is pleased to announce its annual 2-day work shop for PhD research students in urban-related disciplines. The workshop will provide an open, informal and intimate space to collaborate and discuss progress amongst peers with regard to topical, theoretical, practical or methodological concerns. We therefore welcome contributions from students at all stages of the dissertation process. Stadtkolloquium aims to create a supportive environment for urban researchers who to develop their work and meet PhD students from other departments and universities. The workshop is unique in that all participants agree to both present their work and support others in doing so in small group sessions. Organizers hope to generate lively round-table discussions on diverse urban questions across various academic disciplines including Geography, Architecture, History, Anthropology, Literature, Cultural Studies, Development Studies, Fine Arts, Environmental Studies, Gender Studies, Health Sciences, Planning, Engineering and beyond. The four thematic tracks for the 2013 workshop are: A. Re-thinking urban economies Explaining the growth and development of cities has been called 'one of the great challenges for social science' (Storper, 2011, p.33). But what is specifically 'urban' about the range of problems facing economies today? The increasing recognition of the partiality of urban development and growth policies (e.g. global cities; creative cities), the decoupling of economic growth from social and environmental development, the ongoing financial crisis and the emergence of austerity urbanism, as well as decreasing confidence in mainstream economics more generally, suggests that the scope for new ways of theorising, measuring and intervening in urban economies is significant. Contributions are welcomed from PhD students who are exploring some of the diverse ways in which we might re-think urban economies. Key Words: urban economies; re-thinking economy; global cities; creative cities; ordinary cities; development; well-being; financial crisis; austerity urbanism Chairs: Alvaro Sanchez Jimenez, Louis Moreno, Myfanwy Taylor B. Post-colonial approaches to the city An increasing amount of scholarship (Robinson 2006, Roy 2011) has emerged as a critique of the ways in which cities in the global South have been studied. This session aims to discuss cities in ways that respond to this post-colonial questioning of urban theory. How can concepts that emerged in the South, such as informality, be used in cities of the global North? How can empirical studies of cities beyond the West inform urban theory in general? How do concepts such as neo-liberalism or gentrification, change when examined in a non-Western context? The session is interested in theoretical approaches as well as methods of thinking 'comparatively' through both multi- and single case studies. Key Words: Post-colonial theory, comparative urbanism, sub-altern theory Chairs: Hanna Hilbrandt, Susana Neves Alves, Tauri Tuvikene C. Managing the complex city This session will explore pragmatic responses to the problem of managing cities and urban spaces understood to be complex. Such matters arise in the fields of urban design and planning, infrastructure, municipal governance and policy making where the unexpected, contingent, emergent and the nonquantifiable variously problematise efforts to control, order or regulate urban space and process. The session seeks to facilitate discussion of both empirical case studies and theoretical resources for dealing with such issues in urban scholarship. Key words: complexity theory, contingency, emergence, urban governance, co-ordination Chairs: Ine Steenmans, Regan Koch D. Urban Assemblages A dynamic worldview of flux and flow, uncertainty and complexity is being recognised more and more across all disciplines (Whatmore, 2006; De Landa 2006; Lash 2006; Deleuze and Guattari, 1987). But can these post-human, relational and flat ontologies cast a doubt at the appropriateness of the city as the unit of analysis for urban research? This track looks at the application of these approaches to specific cases of empirical urban research through attending to the rich array of human-nonhuman, material-immaterial, and mobile-immobile entanglements. It is specifically concerned with the empirical application of theoretical approaches like assemblages, networks, meshworks and constellations to urban research and the methodological and empirical challenges they bring about. Keywords: Complexity, post-human, relational, materiality, assemblages, networks. Chairs: Hayley Peacock, Pooya Ghoddousi The workshop will take place on 25 & 26 March 2013 at University College London. On the first day, each participant will be given 20 minutes to present their work in small groups of 8 people, followed by 25 minutes of feedback and discussion. The second day will be dedicated to a plenary discussion, two keynote lectures and small group workshops based on accepted participant's suggestions. Call for papers - If you are interested in discussing your work, please send us an abstract (no more than 250 words) of the project you would like to present. Past participants have presented work ranging from upgrade documents, PhD outlines, sample dissertations chapters and journal papers in progress. Please note that while the intimate nature of the workshop provides a uniquely engaging experience, it also significantly limits the number of proposals we are able to accept. Competition for spaces in years past has been very tight. In submitting an abstract, please include the following: - A title and 250 word abstract - Your name, university, department, and year of study. - Abstracts should be emailed to the respective track email: Track A: myfanwy.taylor.09@ucl.ac.uk Track B: tauri.tuvikene.10@ucl.ac.uk Track C: ine.steenmans.09@ucl.ac.uk Track D: pooya.ghoddousi.10@ucl.ac.uk Deadline for proposals: 15th of January 2013 A small conference fee will apply (15 GBP).

254,Urban Laboratory and DPU open letter to UCL Council,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2012/sep/urban-laboratory-and-dpu-open-letter-ucl-council,22 September 2012,"The letter will be considered at the Council's meeting on Wednesday 28th November 2012. 22 November 2012 UCL Urban Laboratory open letter to UCL Council, endorsed by UCL Bartlett Development Planning Unit Dear UCL Council Members We are writing to alert you to our serious concerns with the current version of the ""UCL Stratford Proposition"", which in its current form constitutes a missed opportunity to draw on the expertise of the UCL community and show leadership in developing a sustainable and socially equitable approach to regeneration. UCL Urban Laboratory is a cross-faculty centre for interdisciplinary research and teaching on cities and urbanization. It comprises a network for urban researchers and students, and it promotes UCL's work on cities widely amongst urban scholars, practitioners and the public. We have a particular focus on London, and on housing, regeneration and community engagement, as well as extensive networks internationally, and a wealth of knowledge of cities across the globe. Our work draws from and promotes UCL's rich heritage of pioneering urbanism, evidenced in the work of thinkers and practitioners such as Patrick Abercrombie, Reyner Banham, Ruth Glass, Peter Hall, Otto Königsberger and Walter Segal. We have seen only the public document UCL Stratford Proposition (11 October 2012) and we have not had access to the information on which these proposals have been based. Some of us attended Academic Board (24 October 2012) when a summary of UCL's vision for expansion was presented, albeit without reference to the site, its existing use as the Carpenters Estate, or the opposition of the estate's residents to UCL's proposals. We are united in our view that UCL should not go ahead with a project in which it becomes the replacement use for what has been the home of a settled community with 700 housing units. The dispossession of council estates in London is now a widespread phenomenon. We see this as an aggressive and unethical process, and a major contributing factor to the UK's severe housing crisis, which is concentrated in Newham. UCL cannot legitimately hide behind Newham Council by arguing that the estate was already going to be cleared, or that if it does not go ahead another developer will. If it does proceed without changing direction the College will be operating in a way that contradicts its stated values, and runs counter to the findings of its own researchers, past and present. Severe reputational damage will be inevitable, with UCL being seen as a powerful but destructive external force, with actions that contradict the principles it articulates. Some of us consider, however, that it is not too late for UCL to re-think its approach and to try, in a quite different and more original and creative way, to work with residents and surrounding communities to develop a new proposal. It would, for example, be possible for the quantum of social and affordable housing to be maintained, and the existing and recently-displaced residents to remain alongside teaching, research and UCL residential activity. We therefore urge Council Members to insist that any further decisions on the UCL Stratford Proposition be opened to full debate in UCL, and that the proposals for Stratford be restructured in reference to the wealth of relevant academic, practical and planning expertise held within the UCL community.

255,UCL Engineering co-sponsors Urban Lab,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2012/jun/ucl-engineering-co-sponsors-urban-lab,28 June 2012,"Dr Sarah Bell, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, and a member of the Urban Laboratory's steering committee, comments: ""This sponsorship demonstrates UCL Engineering's commitment to interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and influencing the forces that are shaping cities. Research agendas around 'smart' and 'connected' cities provide a particular point of focus for Engineering and the Urban Lab, bringing together critical, creative and technical approaches"". Dr Ben Campkin, Director of the Urban Lab, welcomed new opportunities for collaboration with colleagues in UCL Engineering, noting that ""knowledge of urban infrastructure and technology within the Engineering Faculty will compliment the Urban Lab's existing built environment expertise, and strengths in the social, cultural and historical understanding of cities and urbanization""."
256,UCL proposals for a Newham campus,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-lab/news/2012/apr/ucl-proposals-newham-campus,25 April 2012,"The site is within the Greater Carpenters Neighbourhood, east of the Olympic Park. The proposals are expected to be considered by the Mayor and the Cabinet of Newham in mid-2012 and a decision made by them and by UCL on whether to proceed to a next stage. Professor Alan Penn, Dean of UCL's Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, and a member of the UCL feasibility team of academics, has recently issued a statement on the plans. Professor Penn is encouraging colleagues with relevant expertise to help ""ensure that UCL fully engages with local communities"". He has also put forward the possibility of UCL developing ""new kinds of education of direct relevance to the communities of East London"", with the aim of transforming ""UCL's reach to the local community, as well as the diversity of our student body."" Similarly, a recent UCL press release quotes Newham Council saying that they are: ""committed to redeveloping the Carpenters Neighbourhood to ensure the delivery of a high quality, educational community for the benefit of existing residents and the wider community. In any negotiations going forward, local residents will not lose out."" The UCL Urban Laboratory - a cross faculty interdisciplinary centre for research and teaching about cities - welcomes these statements, and the ambition for UCL to enhance Newham's community infrastructure and local economy. Dr Ben Campkin, Director of the Urban Laboratory, comments that ""it is vital for UCL's proposals to embody an exemplary approach to regeneration, with the primary aim of benefitting Newham's existing communities. There is a strong tradition of pioneering socially progressive urbanism and rigorous research on London housing at UCL, as represented by Ruth Glass's research on 'gentrification', as well as a wealth of current UCL research on social housing, regeneration and community engagement. The proposals will be strongest if developed outwards from this body of knowledge, and if they respond to work that has been critical of recent regeneration and housing strategies for their failure to benefit lower-income groups"". Michael Edwards, Senior Lecturer in the Bartlett, member of the Urban Laboratory, and expert on London planning economics and community engagement, has suggested that benefits to the existing community will best be achieved through ""in situ training, education and securing more jobs which offer progression;  collaboration with local schools and colleges;  and ensuring that parts of the site are committed to housing (retained or new) which will be genuinely affordable to existing communities"". He argues that it is ""only in this way that 'regeneration' can actually benefit the people in whose name it is done"". Since hearing of the proposals, staff affiliated with the UCL Urban Laboratory have been actively involved in discussions with colleagues across UCL, and particularly UCL's Public Engagement Unit, with a view to enhancing communications with Newham's communities, and ensuring that they are involved in developing UCL's plans, in line with the university's wider public engagement strategy. Drawing residents in all tenure categories and building types within and adjoining the Carpenters' Estate into genuine dialogue about the proposals is clearly vital in order to produce the best possible results."
