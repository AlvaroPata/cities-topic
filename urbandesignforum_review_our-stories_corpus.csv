0,Fellows Spotlight: Dorraine Duncan and Jhordan Channer,https://urbandesignforum.org/fellow-spotlight-jhordan-channer-and-dorraine-duncan/,"March 25, 2022","For this month’s Fellow Spotlight, we spoke with Jhordan Channer and Dorraine Duncan, co-founders of Island City Lab. Island City Lab is a think-tank that confronts the defining issues affecting the built environment of island nations co-founded by Urban Design Forum Fellows Jhordan Channer and Dorraine Duncan. Aiming to develop a network of urbanists, Island City Lab sees the need for the creation and dissemination of best practices in the urban development of Caribbean towns and cities. A major goal for the organization will be to convene stakeholders and break down silos across design, real estate, transit, housing, sustainability, and policy sectors to share new ideas around major urban issues and interrogate commonly held ones. Below, we talk with Jhordan and Dorraine about what’s to come from Island City Lab. At Island City Lab, you’re convening stakeholders and sharing knowledge around critical issues affecting island cities. Why is there a need–specifically in the Caribbean–for a center that encourages a network-based approach to urban issues? DD: Right now–especially in the climate space–there is a lot of attention on the islands. There is this ideology that the islands are the “canary in the coalmine.” That as the populations on the frontlines we will be experiencing the impacts of climate change the fastest and the hardest. And that only from observing our experiences, people outside the region can then learn what to expect and hopefully act. This type of attention means that most of the research and expertise still comes from outside the region and relies on external dollars. Yet, there are lots of talented people here who understand the way our cities operate and the particular vulnerabilities that we face. The real hope is that we’ll build this network of researchers and start collating this knowledge. We want to be the space where that research and experience is held, housed, and disseminated, which is important in order to achieve what we want to see in the Caribbean. JC: What we also want to do is create more transparency around the processes that produce our cities and environments and challenge ideas about who has a voice in how our cities form. One thing we really emphasize is tapping into lived and learned experience and creating connections across class and professional barriers. Tapping into the people who are experiencing the environment is as important as the people who are studying it from a high level. How did your experiences in New York lead you to create Island City Lab? DD: We moved to New York in 2018 and very early on became embedded in these multidisciplinary networks of people who work on the built environment. Whether it was through our jobs or through professional societies like DivComm, we got very used to the idea of working with a broad slew of professions across the sector. Tackling urban challenges necessitated a broad, silo-breaking approach. Seeing that work in New York got us into thinking what that approach would look like for the Caribbean.JC: New York has really strong civil society groups which expanded our ideas about our role as urbanists. During the Forefront Fellowship, we got to interact with a lot of these groups for our projects. Groups like Blackspace, for example, really fostered us as urban professionals. Blackspace’s manifesto is really foundational to how we think about Island City Lab. Dorraine Duncan with members of her 2019 Forefront cohort at “Invisible Networks: Everyday and In Times of Crisis“ You were both Forefront Fellows–Jhordan in 2020 and Dorraine in 2019. Was that experience helpful in informing your approach? DD: Forefront was a very unique and transformative experience for us. The power of convening people is underestimated. The simple benefit of saying, ‘alright, I’m creating a space for you guys to come here together and learn and explore,’ is a big deal. So many people are excited to explore urban issues; different, or broader than the issues they focus on for their jobs and unfortunately a space for that type of urban learning doesn’t really exist regionally in the Caribbean. The other benefit of creating this type of space is that you realize the limitations of your own skills and profession and become a bit humbled. JC: Even as a methodology, this network based approach that we learned in Forefront taught us that you don’t always have to be the expert, but you can talk to the expert. That kind of approach is really inspiring. We can apply it to the Caribbean – there’s a lot of expertise on the ground here. This can create real transformation in the governance of our urban environment. How are you hoping to expand interest in this work to the general public? JC: Our vision is to be a resource for good urban governance, specific to our context, and really bridge this gap across the Caribbean. Each person living in a city is an urbanist and they should have a say on how their environments are produced. We really want to think about the Caribbean regionally and foster this network for people engaged in urban life. To build a base of urban research that acts as a repository of assets that people can tap into that is digestible and understandable by the public as well as specific audiences. DD: Being a Fellow, there is an understanding that there is a strength in this network. The most exciting and inspiring part of UDF is your ability to extend that network in service of your Fellows and their aspirations and pursuits. I really hope that we’re able to do that at Island City Lab as well. I hope we can make those connections across the region because it is a very useful resource and something we are dedicated to growing and developing. “Caribbean Women in Architecture,” a lecture series presented by CASA in association with Island City Lab Tell us about the series on Caribbean women in architecture and what you have coming up in the next few months? JC: The Caribbean Women in Architecture series is a collaboration between us and the Caribbean Architecture Students Association (CASA), a student group within the Caribbean School of Architecture. When I was teaching there, there was no real space for us to have professional discourse around the state of practice. With this series, the students want to bridge the gap between academia and professional practice and another gap between the islands on issues affecting the profession of architecture. These are intelligent, visionary students, and we believe leadership comes from diverse places. I really want the Lab to help youth leaders create a platform for themselves. DD: The other event series we are planning is “Water is Life: Climate Adapted Cities.” The IPCC reports say that water security is going to be the defining issue for small islands. With this series, we’re trying to bring in different professionals to discuss solutions to island level water security. We want to explore how updated building codes, zoning, density laws, and green infrastructure can help protect, preserve and recharge our water resources. Solutions to these challenges already exist already in the Caribbean. For example, Bermuda has mandated rainwater catchment in all homes for decades. There are islands out here that have very innovative solutions and indigenous approaches and designs. We’re excited because we’re looking across the Caribbean for innovation and expertise and discussing in what context these solutions may be feasible for other islands. ""As urbanists, we talk a lot about climate migration, and it can seem very abstract and long-term. However, it is a reality now in the Caribbean."" What lessons do you think that practitioners here in New York could probably learn from island cities? JC: One is that New York is a major financial center, so it can produce a lot of funding and innovation hubs for technology and large infrastructure projects that are advertised as the solution to urban ills. However, we’re finding in our conversations on the Caribbean that the key is really about good governance of our urban environment and the institutions that manage it. With limited resources, the first reaction here is usually not to spend money, but to think about how to strengthen the institutions that manage and steward the urban environment. New York could really learn from the Caribbean in this sense. I also think New York is going to learn that if the island situation isn’t sorted, immigration from our islands into US cities is going to be major. Investing in research around loss and damage in the Caribbean is extremely important. DD: As urbanists, we talk a lot about climate migration, and it can seem very abstract and long-term. However, it is a reality now in the Caribbean. It’s a very dangerous confluence of climate-based migration followed by disaster capitalism. Barbuda, an island in the Eastern Caribbean where the majority of the population has been displaced because of Hurricane Irma now has to fight off billionaire real-estate investors who are snatching their land to set up luxury hotels. You can almost imagine hearing a story like this in NYC too, where displacement of the marginalized is worsened by extreme vulnerabilities to weather combined with extreme unfettered wealth. New York may not be a [Caribbean] island, and is definitely not as vulnerable as we are – but the same climatic and economic forces that affect us will definitely also impact you all. What are the personal habits and activities that help inspire and motivate you on a day to day basis? DD: We’ve moved to a bit of a more suburban lifestyle in Jamaica that is very different from our Flatbush apartment. We have a lot of yard space and we were like, ‘what are we going to do?’ So, we took up gardening, and it’s been the most therapeutic and meditative act. As someone who is trying to start an organization, patience is something that I’m not very good at…!JC: Gardening really taught me to foster and anticipate things. I feel like our successes in gardening filters into other successes and teaches you how to deal with failure. It’s an amazing metaphor. Jhordan Channer prepping soil to plant a tamarind tree in their yard in Jamaica Anything you’d like to share with the UDF network? DD: Both Jhordan and I were on student visas for the entire time we were in the US. We applied for work visas and both of us were unsuccessful. In New York, there are so many immigrants doing really exciting things, but their immigration status is so fickle. It’s based on policies, but also luck of the draw. Being unsuccessful and having to leave the country was a shock to our system. Jhordan and I were starting to make so many plans for our future in NYC and then all of that was suddenly taken away from us. It was sad, but that’s a common story for lots of immigrants across the US. That kind of heartbreak led us to this moment. I feel like it’s valuable to know that after that sadness there are opportunities to find your footing back home. JC: Also getting reacquainted with your city–the city that you were born in–is an incredible process. Understanding the city again, loving it for taking care of you before you went away, and ultimately wanting the best for it… in a way, that inspired us to start Island City Lab. Immigration is part of the Caribbean experience–if you’re privileged enough to do so–and now we want to foster what we have here. I want that for all Caribbean people.

1,Neighborhoods Now: In Conversation with Ryan Gilliam,https://urbandesignforum.org/neighborhoods-now-in-conversation-with-ryan-gilliam/,"April 30, 2021","We are excited to continue our Neighborhoods Now initiative with Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) and Think!Chinatown in Chinatown and Banana Kelly in the South Bronx. Additionally, we expanded our partnership with FABnyc in the Lower East Side. These working groups will reenergize outdoor spaces to support community programming and cultural revitalization. These next few weeks, we will be rolling out interviews with the representatives of each organization to learn more about their history, some neighborhood insights, and what they hope to achieve through Neighborhoods Now. Check out our feature below with Ryan Gilliam, Executive Director of FABnyc. Marvel, SHoP, and Buro Happold will be helping FABnyc expand their Neighborhoods Now collaboration with four new member organizations: Frankel Theatre, KGB Bar / Red Room, Loisaida Inc., and Performance Space New York. Together they will develop reopening strategies tailored to needs of smaller performing arts organizations, including ways to participate in New York City’s Open Culture program. Tell us a little bit about your organization. Ryan Gilliam: FABnyc began as a coalition of arts and community organizations on East 4th Street working together to stay in a handful of city buildings which we’d fixed up over several decades. With broad community support, we were successful in stopping them from going to auction and instead transferred to local groups, establishing the East 4th Street Cultural District, the densest single block of arts activity in NYC. FABnyc’s mission grew and today we focus on the cultural vitality of the entire Lower East Side. Site visit at Loisaida, Inc. Photo: Jonathan Molloy What types of work has your organization been involved in and what are some issues that this community still faces? RG: The Lower East Side has been struggling with the ongoing impacts of gentrification and displacement. Despite tremendous pressure, residents have organized successfully in ways that have protected affordable housing, supported small businesses, deepened resilience, and preserved the diverse cultural character of the community. FABnyc is a partner to the community, bringing artists and arts practices to creatively collaborate in addressing community issues. Site visit at the Gene Frankel Theater. Photo: Jonathan Molloy What makes this neighborhood special? RG: The Lower East Side — which we define by its historic boundaries from 14th Street to Canal, the East River to Chinatown — has a remarkable history as a home to working class and poor immigrants, artists, radicals, and visionaries. The LES has a long history as an inclusive, welcoming place with a creative spirit and commitment to social justice. The murals, bodegas, community gardens, active social service organizations, small theaters, restaurants, political vibrancy, and street life all reflect that character. What are some neighborhood spots that are most important to people in this community? RG: Honestly, there are too many to name. We love our open spaces like Tompkins Square, festivals like the Loisaida Festival, hole-in-the-wall bars, tiny restaurants where they know you. We have a lot to mourn that’s been lost to displacement, so we tend to make strong attachments to those who have deep roots here — the theaters of 4th Street, the settlement houses, the entire bustling hub that is Chinatown — but also the people, so many of whom have spoken out, organized, and fought to keep the spirit and connectedness of community alive. Site visit at the Gene Frankel Theater. Photo: Jonathan Molloy What are you hoping to achieve through this partnership and where are you now in your work with Neighborhoods Now? RG: We have not only been able to prepare more than a dozen performing arts organizations for re-opening after a year of closure, but we are now working with our design partners to celebrate FABnyc’s 20th year, by imagining the next 20. It’s a unique opportunity to create a real vision of our mission — to imagine ways to support the cultural life of a community while centering that vision in equity, access, and resiliency. We’ve just had our first brainstorm together and are excited for what’s to come. Photos: Jonathan Molloy"
2,Neighborhoods Now: In Conversation with Ian Gray-Stack,https://urbandesignforum.org/neighborhoods-now-in-conversation-with-ian-gray-stack/,"April 1, 2021","We are excited to continue our Neighborhoods Now initiative with Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) and Think!Chinatown in Chinatown and Banana Kelly in the South Bronx. Additionally, we expanded our partnership with Fourth Arts Block in the Lower East Side. These working groups will reenergize outdoor spaces to support community programming and cultural revitalization. These next few weeks, we will be rolling out interviews with the representatives of each organization to learn more about their history, some neighborhood insights, and what they hope to achieve through Neighborhoods Now. Read an interview with Ian Gray-Stack, Director of Community Organizing at Banana Kelly. The South Bronx working group will reactivate community gardens in Longwood, Hunts Point, Morrisania, and Mott Haven, allowing for safe outdoor activities and services that address neighborhood needs. Tell us a little bit about your organization. Ian Gray-Stack: Battling city intentions to demolish every building that was not slated for renovation through a federal program, the residents on that section of Kelly Street known as “Banana Kelly” took matters into their own hands and, in 1978, “liberated” three buildings to begin the long process of rehabilitation through “sweat equity.” Over 40 years later, Banana Kelly has expanded its portfolio to around 65 affordable housing buildings across the Hunts Point and Longwood neighborhoods and continues to fight for high-quality affordable housing by organizing residents and other community members and providing the direct services and resources necessary for residents to come together and take action. What types of work has your organization been involved in and what are some issues that this community still faces? IG: We have three main departments: property management, direct services, and community organizing. We provide tenants with wrap around services like eviction protection and rental assistance, while also organizing them into tenant associations and block associations so that they can deepen relationships with their neighbors, identify common issues, and begin to strategize possible actions that will lead to concrete changes. Several of our buildings are also connected to community gardens which serve as hubs in those areas for the work that residents are steering. Most recently, our work has focused on providing families with direct COVID-19 relief such as emergency food deliveries, PPE supplies, and virtual workshops focusing on various aspects of the current pandemic. What makes this neighborhood special? IG: There is a lot that makes our neighborhood special, but in my personal opinion I think it’s the diverse mixture of people that has always made it such a unique place. So many different people from across the country and the globe living side by side has led to amazing new artistic and culinary creations that have gone on to become globally sensationalized: hip hop, graffiti, breakdancing, and salsa to name a few. What are some neighborhood spots that are most important to people in this community? IG: This is a difficult one for me to answer because I’ve been working in these two particular neighborhoods for only a year and all during a pandemic, but one that jumps to mind is Concrete Plant Park, a recently redesigned stretch along the Bronx River with seating areas, a bike pathway, and diverse grasslands plants. Another important neighborhood spot is Casita Maria, which provides a wide range of youth and arts programming. What are you hoping to achieve through this partnership? IG: With this partnership, I hope to work with residents to design short, medium, and long-term visions for each of our 5 community gardens, as well as a plan for implementation. I’d like to use the design process to facilitate the development of garden committees and tenant associations that can help design the vision for their garden and then facilitate the implementation of this vision going forward. Right now, we have conducted site visits and have begun to formulate these visions for all of our gardens and in doing so have re-engaged some of our long-standing garden leaders. Some of the pieces of these visions will be implemented before the end of the Neighborhoods Now partnership and some pieces will be ongoing organizing projects taking us at least to the end of this year.

3,Neighborhoods Now: In Conversation with Yin Kong and Thomas Yu,https://urbandesignforum.org/neighborhoods-now-in-conversation-with-yin-kong-and-thomas-yu/,"March 24, 2021","We are excited to continue our Neighborhoods Now initiative with Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) and Think!Chinatown in Chinatown and Banana Kelly in the South Bronx. Additionally, we expanded our partnership with Fourth Arts Block in the Lower East Side. These working groups will reenergize outdoor spaces to support community programming and cultural revitalization. These next few weeks, we will be rolling out interviews with the representatives of each organization to learn more about their history, some neighborhood insights, and what they hope to achieve through Neighborhoods Now. Check out our first feature below with Yin Kong, Director of Think!Chinatown, and Thomas Yu, Co-Executive Director of AAFE. The Chinatown working group will develop a proposal to adapt Forsyth Street Plaza into an open-air market supporting local Chinatown businesses and cultural groups. Tell us a little bit about your organization. Thomas Yu: Asian Americans for Equality, or AAFE, was founded nearly five decades ago by local residents and activists who rallied for racial justice and equal opportunities in Chinatown and for all communities in need. Yin Kong: Think!Chinatown is an intergenerational nonprofit. We’ve been growing steadily and rapidly since we started about four years ago. Our aim is to overcome barriers of community organizing where socioeconomic factors, language, and cultural barriers create challenges for immigrant communities’ autonomy to make decisions in their own neighborhood. What types of work has your organization been involved in and what are some issues that this community still faces? TY: AAFE advances the lives of low-income, immigrant and minority New Yorkers through social services, affordable housing development, economic opportunity, and advocacy. Our core communities, such as Chinatown, still face disinvestment from the City for fair share of resources, diminishing affordable housing, economic impact from pandemic, lack of access to capital, poverty, and racial discrimination. YK: Led by myself and Board President Amy Chin, T!C’s Chinatown Arts Week produces several cultural events throughout the week, all of them free to the public. By presenting grassroots Chinatown artists and emerging Asian American artists together in a collaborative partnership, we hope to bring the generations together and connect with a wider arts audience. With the pandemic, there has been both increased need and increased attention and support for our community. Our output in the past year has sharply increased, and we need to build our organization so it can continue to do this work. What makes this neighborhood special? TY: Chinatown is the spiritual and cultural core of one of the largest Chinese American communities in the Western Hemisphere. YK: It not only serves the local residents, but also a greater API community who finds a sense of home in the neighborhood. In this difficult time, it’s been wonderful to see how the greater community has supported the neighborhood to ensure the survival of our collective cultural home. Once businesses or cultural organizations are gone, that cultural knowledge goes with them. What are some neighborhood spots that are most important to people in this community? TY: All our public spaces are precious to our community, because we have one of the fewest open space ratios per person in the entire city. YK: Because we don’t have a ton of open space, our restaurants and small businesses are really the hotspots of our community. With our ‘Assembly for Chinatown’ project, we constructed fully subsidized, code compliant outdoor dining solutions for Chinatown restaurants. By taking on the design challenges of adjusting to post-COVID set-ups, we aim to protect these important cultural hubs throughout our neighborhood. What are you hoping to achieve through this partnership? TY: [We want to] activate that scarce public space in Forsyth Plaza to be a cultural sanctuary for local residents and all New Yorkers. YK: We’re hoping to work on creating infrastructure for a night market in the plaza — financial mechanisms, marketing, design & construction of vending carts, administration of regulations — that will support a night market of food vendors along Forsyth. We fear inequity in the recovery period will result in accelerated displacement in Chinatown. By connecting mom & pop immigrant businesses and grassroots arts groups with the technical support of architects or the language and communication support of bilingual volunteers, we hope to give these businesses the tools they need to survive the economic crisis.

4,Turning the Heat Collection of Proposals: Introduction,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-collection-of-proposals-introduction/,"December 15, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways how urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. Read the full compilation of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. By Katherine Sacco This collection presents the work completed by the Urban Design Forum addressing climate justice issues in New York City through the 2019-2020 Forefront Fellowship. Created in 2016, the Forefront Fellowship is an annual program cultivating emerging leaders in urban design, advocacy, development, and policy. Our 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, explored how urban design can confront the climate risks facing vulnerable neighborhoods in New York City. In the first phase of the Fellowship, our work focused on extreme heat. From May to July 2019, our Fellows partnered with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency (MOR) to address how urban design can mitigate the impacts of extreme heat in New York City’s most heat vulnerable neighborhoods. Fellows spent three months studying diverse building typologies, surveying five neighborhoods, and interviewing nearly 40 New York-based and international stakeholders, to produce recommendations for strengthening heat resiliency across the city. Equipped with the knowledge from their summer work with MOR, our Fellows then developed independent projects exploring how design can advance climate justice across New York’s housing, health, food, waste, and water systems. From September 2019 to March 2020, Fellows organized evening events, interviewed community leaders, studied case studies, and developed original design and policy proposals that are presented here. This compilation collects the original design and policy proposals developed by the Fellows on mitigating the public health impacts of climate change; closing the loop on the city’s food, waste, and water systems; supporting community-led resiliency strategies; and taking a fair-share approach to solving the housing crisis while also strengthening climate resiliency. Each proposal is accompanied by interviews with leaders in climate justice and design, including Gretchen West, Will Sibia, Jeffrey Moelis, and Chloe Arnow. Our aim in presenting these ideas is to ignite a debate about how to build a more just, resilient, and equitable city for New Yorkers facing the increasingly urgent impacts of climate change. We hope you will share your ideas with us."
5,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Chloe Arnow,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-chloe-arnow/,"December 14, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Chloe Arnow, Project Manager at Enterprise Community Partners, accompanies Community Resiliency. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Dorraine Duncan: Could you talk about what Enterprise Community Partners is and your role there? Chloe Arnow: Enterprise is a national affordable housing organization and has been around for 40+ years. We have an investment arm, we have a policy arm, and we have a program arm. I work on the program side with the public housing team. Previously, I was working in different aspects of kind of food systems, and came into housing interested in the food conditions of the communities that we serve. I realized it was an untapped area of opportunity for the programmatic model that Enterprise used to create healthy and connected communities. We have a strong health and housing platform so I started advocating for including food conditions as part of how we define health and housing. In 2014, Enterprise produced a report that outlined a number of barriers that public housing residents face with food access and affordability. NYC has one of the most prolific delivery infrastructures in the world. Time is money and for low income New Yorkers, time is even more so, money. More and more folks are getting groceries delivered, but because of a number of barriers, public housing residents typically have been locked out from the usage of this. More and more folks are getting groceries delivered, but because of a number of barriers, public housing residents typically have been locked out from the usage of this. How can housing be used as a platform to address some of the food insecurity? DD: In 2019, Enterprise organized a pilot project for NYCHA residents to access grocery delivery using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. What sparked this pilot project at the Farragut Houses? CA: The footprint of public housing overlays perfectly in New York City with the most food insecure conditions. The population that lives within NYCHA is the same as the population of Atlanta, Georgia—500,000+ people. They should actually be some of the most powerful consumers in New York City with a customer segment of that size. But these are the consumers with the least power. They have been completely isolated and cut off from quality goods and services, including access to quality, affordable groceries. There is now a wave of corporations that are turning their attention to tapping the low-income market as the last frontier. How do we ensure that residents as users are represented at the table to negotiate the maximum benefit and set the terms of those relationships as they begin to form? We started fundraising around our idea and gained a good amount of funder interest. We then started building a project team of Enterprise, the Fund for Public Housing, NYCHA, and the CUNY Urban Food Policy Institute as our evaluators. We raised around $400,000 over 11 months. In August of 2018, the project team kicked off the site selection process and narrowed down from six hundred prospective sites to the Farragut Houses. To do that, we created a massive scorecard of criteria, aggregating data on all of the developments and Farragut came out on top. DD: Could you speak to what criteria you used to look for which complex to look to work with? CA: We looked at demographics and made sure that the development was representative of other NYCHA developments. For example, making sure there wasn’t a disproportionate ratio of seniors to youth. Another criteria within the long list was making sure that the food conditions in the community were not extreme one way or the other. In August 2018, we decided on Farragut and then in October 2018, we started going on site to engage and recruit residents. The pilot was really founded on a philosophy of user-centered design. When users design solutions, they’re exponentially more effective and outcomes are exponentially more impactful. We brought these general hypotheses, resources and expertise to the table for the residents of Farragut to design their own food access and affordability solution. Photo: Jules Antonio Our first job was to create relationships and build trust with influencers in the community, whether that’s the Tenant Association or people who are known to be involved in different organizing efforts. We started to work with Brooklyn Community Services– they are the local operators of the community center at Farragut and they work in a number of different NYCHA communities. They assisted us with the recruitment events and met every Thursday for seven months. We landed with a Leadership Committee of seven residents who would operate the club. Currently, four of the original leaders remain and two new leaders are coming on board. The residents then used our expertise to create a service model that worked for them. They chose to work with Amazon as it was one of three firms that have the rights to pilot the rollout of online SNAP benefits in New York City. Walmart was not an option as they do not have physical stores in NYC and theirs is a store based model. Wakefern was unresponsive. The residents chose Amazon because, if they’re buying groceries online, it’s an absolute necessity for a majority of the population to be able to use their SNAP and Amazon was responsive and eager to partner. In the partnership with Amazon, the residents pointed out a number of usage and access barriers that needed to be solved in order for online delivery to be successful. In public housing developments, there are no door personnel to accept deliveries. If you’re not home, there’s no safe, secure delivery infrastructure that’s flexible for pickup at your convenience. No one wants fresh groceries sitting on your doormat while you are at work. Also, for seniors or other homebound individuals, there was a lack of comfort to open the door for delivery personnel that they didn’t know. Virginia, the director of distribution, received all the orders at the community center. We have a commercial fridge and we have a lock storage. She receives all the deliveries, sorts them, makes sure they’re stored equally, and keeps them fresh. She also coordinates either a familiar face to make the home delivery or she coordinates a convenient pickup time for folks to come to the community center. The other barriers that had to be addressed in the partnership with Amazon were all of the fees with buying groceries online and getting them delivered. The Farragut Food Club said we need the Prime membership fee waived and delivery minimums lowered. Amazon eliminated minimums in all grocery categories except Amazon Fresh. They also requested that the packages come at a desired day and at a desired time. Amazon built out an aggregation mechanism to ensure all the packages came in an efficient manner. Service is also provided with their second partner, which they selected as Western Beef. The residents love the price and quality, and wanted to be able to get that delivered. That partnership is actually made possible through a third party. Instacart also agreed to waive the membership fees and the delivery fees, and they deliver the Western Beef groceries to the food club. There’s a ton of computer literacy and digital equity issues that go into enabling this population to take advantage of online SNAP and grocery delivery. The food club helps people register, make Amazon or Instacart accounts, make an email to make those accounts, and make sure folks have access to a computer, either in the computer lab of the community center or using a hotspot in their home. An important role is also assisting members in price comparisons and other bargain hunting tactics which are not easy to navigate on Amazon’s platform. They will also go and make home visits to make sure that people know how to use their EBT card on Amazon. There’s a wealth of computer literacy training that needs to happen to connect these dots. DD: This is an amazing program. What kind of metrics are you using to evaluate the impact? Are cost-saving or timesaving metrics taken into account? CA: From July to November, we operated the prototype. During that time, over 250 orders had gone through the club. We had originally had metrics of serving 30 to 50 people in that window, but we don’t actually know how many unique users are in that 250 number because Amazon didn’t give that to us. Still, 250 orders going through was far beyond kind of our metrics of success. Having such a short pilot didn’t give us the ability to measure health outcomes. However, I think we all agree on the philosophy that if people can afford healthy food and it is very convenient for them, their chances of actually making healthier choices go up. In terms of actually quantifying the time and money saved, we know that people who shop are using an entire Saturday to get onto trains and a bus to go to your Costco or BJs, or go and bargain hunt at four different supermarkets, and then pay to transport groceries with a car service. We know for a fact that this intervention eliminates that time and those transportation costs for folks. If you compare that to the 30 minutes that it takes someone to shop online, time savings there is helpful. We did see that the price points aren’t radically different, so I think the money savings really comes with the lack of need to pay for transportation going to and from the store. How do you actually quantify those values? How do you quantify being able to spend a whole day with your family? In the long run, it’s going to be interesting to see how we can quantify time and money savings that we see over a longer period of time. DD: As this pilot study moves on and you begin assessing it with the funders, have you talked about the idea of scaling up and the ability to then negotiate more favorable terms with either Western Beef or Amazon? CA: The goal is to find how we can position housing residents to design and own their own solutions, and then create value and revenue to sustain them, creating income and potential job opportunities. The goal is to find how we can position housing residents to design and own their own solutions, and then create value and revenue to sustain them, creating income and potential job opportunities. Essentially, the Farragut Food Club realized that convincing their neighbors to try something new translates to people essentially being the brand ambassadors for this new service. Brand ambassadors and influencers get paid to introduce new services and they will kind of be the currency of trust that’s behind behavior change. The residents realize that the brand ambassador service that they’re providing— outreach, awareness, education, screening, and computer literacy —are what people in the marketplace get paid for. We’re currently exploring the different revenue streams that could potentially turn into a sustainable business model, the mechanism that will allow for replication and scaling, and providing an incentive to grow it at the current site. The Farragut Food Club model is the only current model that is dealing with this gap in the consumer chain that is crippling uptake of Online SNAP. There is a huge opportunity to negotiate with retailers that are rolling out online SNAP in some other cities. We have a massive opportunity to also collectivize our leverage to create standards and negotiate the maximum community benefits and investment in these models. We are advocating for residents that is based on all of the areas I described: brand ambassadorship, the theater with the digital access, the last mile delivery, and the exploration of employment pathways. We are also looking at other cities and serving as an example to roll out similar models such as Seattle and Baltimore. Coordinating with other cities is important so that when these retailers like Amazon do approach, there are standardized terms and communication infrastructure to reply upon. One thing I want to point out is that as we explore a revenue stream that would be possible to support this, where we’re also in parallel exploring a cooperative model as a viable structure. DD: As this pilot grows and maybe other cities jump on board, do you think that this kind of delivery model is transferable to other goods and services outside of food, such as resilience-related services? CA: The Farragut Food Club created a hub of collective advocacy within a community. It doesn’t matter that food was the impetus for this. What matters is the strength that all-women-run groups have created between themselves and with their community members. What if everyone had a monthly or bi-monthly purchasing match of an extra canned good and it was stockpiled in a reserve in case of any extreme event facing the community? Could we use this Farragut Food Club network as a communication hub in times of emergencies such as extreme weather events? It’s a grassroots form of creating really strong networks and communication networks for maintenance that are trusted and community based. DD: How do you attract someone to something like this? What’s the organizing mentality? CA: I see it in a multitude of ways. The president of the club has had this organizing spirit her whole life, which is very unique. I also think the club gives a sense of purpose and a sense of community in some of these women’s lives that are extremely difficult in a lot of other ways. They have gotten to know each other and they’ve gotten to know a lot of their other community members that they didn’t get to before. I think on a human level, it’s what people look for.

6,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Tina Johnson,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-tina-johnson/,"December 14, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Tina Johnson, founding member of the We Act for Environmental Justice membership steering committee, accompanies Community Resiliency. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Rhonda-Lee Davis: How could we foster discussions around resident-led strategies for resiliency on NYCHA campuses? Tina Johnson: There’s a problem with how people look at NYCHA like, “NYCHA is over there. They’re on that campus.” It replicates the isolation that people experience when they’re living there, because the problem is always “over there.” If you want to talk about issues with NYCHA buildings, people don’t understand that NYCHA is subject to different rules than a private landlord. NYCHA is governed by rules that come from HUD. For many years, we were told, “Oh, you should call 311 about that.” Actually, I can’t call 311. “Yes, you can.” These discussions deteriorate into an assumption that the NYCHA resident hasn’t tried to follow through. Now, sometimes that is the case. But in many cases, people are actively trying to address their issues. Once these issues started coming out into the media, and there were all these scandals, many people were apologetic, like, “I didn’t know that was it.” Well, you would have known that was it if you looked at me as a person, and you listened to me, and you didn’t see NYCHA tattooed across my forehead. NYCHA residents are also afraid to talk to each other. I’ve lived there my whole life, so my story in the Grant Houses is intergenerational. I have to know people, because I have to keep face, I come from a big family. I have a different foundation to hold on to. But some of the people that move in are not keyed into that core. Maybe they came out of a homeless shelter, or maybe they’re coming from another development somewhere else. A lot of people look for a way to distinguish themselves, to say, “I’m one of the good ones. I’m not part of all those stereotypes.” The problems that exist with NYCHA are certainly around physical plan, but there is also a mental health burden. It’s coming into public spaces and feeling like you have to hide where you’re from, or coming up against stereotypes. The way that things are now, it’s going to take too long to coax these stereotypes out of people. That’s why I feel like an urban design structure would be the best way to tackle this problem, because it’s dynamic. You could talk about things like: what is the value of the campus? What are the values of the old growth trees? Out of the percentage of old growth trees in Manhattan, how many of them are on NYCHA campuses? What about if we split it up and we start building buildings on parking lots and parks, is that going to decrease the value of the land? Can we reinterpret the green space so that people can have growing beds, or gardens and take ownership? So that’s one part. But then you also could get past the stereotypes, and people could start to conceptualize the value of NYCHA campuses. RLD: My team has been thinking extensively about the idea of a social hub and the intricacies that go into successfully creating social cohesion. We’ve also been thinking about what that means for the large senior population of NYCHA. TJ: I have found that it’s better to think of social cohesion in the process of other activities. Rather than just thinking that we need a center where people can meet, we need to first think about what would make a center work. We’d have to have babysitters. We’d have to have food. If you think about all those other things that go with it, then maybe you can find other arenas for those activities. If I had a community center, maybe I would have the groups run by seniors. I would have some of the youth teach seniors how to use computers. If there were seniors that didn’t want to do computers, maybe they wanted to help the little kids with their homework. This would foster an atmosphere of social cohesion between the old people, the young people, and the middle generation. Grant Houses, Photo: Creative Commons RLD: What way is there for people to NYCHA residents engage in community action? TJ: There’s the typical way that people would engage: identifying the issue, organizing around it, and putting pressure on the people that can make decisions. It’s possible to do that within NYCHA. But at the same time as that is happening inside NYCHA, it is equally as important for the outside community to embrace it. For that to happen, social cohesion activities should also invite interaction with the surrounding community. For instance, where I live, people will come over to the NYCHA campus to walk their dogs. I would not be against having a dog run where the people who own dogs in NYCHA, and the people who own dogs outside come together and foster relationships. For every problem, there’s an opportunity. The land is part of a community. The rules and the laws would have to be changed internally. But if we can make the ownership of NYCHA campuses happen by the community and by the taxpayers, that’s also a way to take it out of the realm of the tenants against NYCHA. Even though I live in NYCHA and NYCHA makes the rules that govern living in the apartment, NYCHA doesn’t control my humanity. It doesn’t control who I’m able to talk to, who I’m able to work with. Working across the table to increase pressure from rank and file citizens would help the rank and file tenants. Right now, all the discussions are in the realm of policy-speak, legal-speak, and no one really understands. But the issues are very simple. RLD: I’m really interested in questions, legalese, issues, and concerns around repairs. Do you have any insight on the process and improvements that need to be made to how repairs are handled? TJ: My development had the highest number of pest complaints and none of them were addressed. Then, when the media asked NYCHA why they weren’t addressing them, they said, “We didn’t have the money.” But it did not stop an assistant manager from telling me, “That’s not our fault. It’s your fault. This is the way you live.” We have to advance the conversation past that. People need to say, “Enough is enough.” When you go to these websites, and you look at the repair schedule and budget, you have the developments with the worst problems getting the attention first. But they’re not going to be righted until four years from now, and then they still have to do the people who weren’t at the top of the list. In the meantime, there’s all this pressure for privatization. It’s a scheme that only covers maybe 20% of the budget shortfall in exchange for a 35-year lease and a new development. If you’re going to build a new building, it makes more sense to me to build the building, take the people out of the worst buildings, put them in the new building, and then fix the old building and bring homeless people in there or whatever the case is. Create a dynamic pipeline. But right now, the problem is being looked at in a linear manner. RLD: When I was looking at these repair charts, the number of repairs are going up and up, and people are waiting longer each year. TJ: I have a ticket open that will be going on being open for three years in March or April. About five or six people have come to my house over this three-year period to verify that I need this work done. They’re not fixing anything. As a tenant, you wonder where the breakdown in communication is happening. There’s no transparency with the repairs. I should be able to go to the MyNYCHA website and see what’s happening in real time. If I can’t do that, then I can’t trust that the work that you did was done. This has been one of the major issues between NYCHA and their tenants. There is a mental load. I feel it from my neighbors as well. It keeps them from wanting to get involved and try to fix things, because they feel like no one’s listening to them. RLD: It seems like people are trying to do this work on behalf of the community, but it doesn’t seem like NYCHA is supporting these efforts. TJ: Yes. For example, there have been several people who have tried to tackle the recycling issue. NYCHA claims that it recycles, but it doesn’t. When there are people that want to come in and actually do the work, for some reason, it’s not allowed. The recycling trainings were insufficient, and the equipment required to have a successful recycling program was not in place. It’s almost like the tenants are being held to a higher standard that you can’t meet. And people are using it to degrade you. RLD: The idea of NYCHA now residents having to be the ones who are arguing for recycling or having food co-ops, on top of addressing basic needs, seems like just another level of mental stress. TJ: I agree. I think that many people of color who moved into NYCHA came here during certain periods. When the opportunity became available to move into NYCHA, many communities moved in together. I consider my buildings like a small town and small community. There’s this cultural continuum that is very strong. People are replicating the systems that they brought to the city as a way to organize themselves and to have support systems. Through this lens, you see public housing not just purely from a socioeconomic standpoint, but also as a place of internationalism, because now we have Africans, South Asians— it mimics the larger society. But there are survival systems from the historic movement of people that persist. And those survival systems, unfortunately, instead of being celebrated, understood, shared and respected, have become a code. Public housing has been developing out of sight and people have known for a long time ,“I’m on my own.” So they organize accordingly. RLD: How did you become a community organizer? What are some of the recommendations you have for us when engaging with tenant organizers? TJ: I started to react around 2010 when I realized that repairs were needed in my apartment that weren’t just basic maintenance. These are things that I had been dealing with for decades. I had the wall taken apart between my kitchen and my bathroom, and then I had to wait nine months for them to close it up. But then it wasn’t over— it was just slowly coming back as if they did all of that for nothing. Then I started noticing and taking pictures of the outside of buildings. And I thought, I wonder if there’s a correlation between the two. I know a lot of the older seniors that are politically active and one of them suggested that I run for Tenant Association (TA) president. Little by little I started getting involved. I wrote a grant to provide free CPR and first aid training to people that ran home daycares and also to youth who were interested in some sort of entrepreneurial employment experience. After I did that, I decided to get involved in the TA Association. I later decided that I was going to get involved with WE ACT. At the time, WE ACT was doing the Northern Manhattan Climate Action Plan envisioning. I wanted to learn more about what was happening around me to see if there were other people going through what I’m going through. After the Climate Action plan was finished, I got involved in building an emergency preparedness kiosk on the Manhattanville campus. We wanted to reimagine the space so that it would function as an area for social cohesion, for education, and for community engagement. I later decided to become an employee of WE ACT because I love the organization. Whatever I do, whatever I accomplish, is going to benefit my community. That was a huge factor in deciding to apply for a position, but the biggest thing was the opportunity to learn, grow, get experience, and become more powerful to affect change. I feel gratitude to be able to do this work, and I want to make sure that this kind of work is available. We need sounding boards for the community. They might not be called WE ACT, but this is a model that needs to be perpetuated and that I’m dedicated to that right now.

7,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Jeffrey Moelis,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-jeffrey-moelis/,"December 11, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City.

The following interview with Jeffrey Moelis, Managing Director of Preservation at L+M Development, accompanies Just Climate, Just Housing. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Mallory Taub: Could you tell us how your work addresses equitable low carbon building design? Jeffrey Moelis: As a firm, we recognized, like most sane people have, that climate change is real, and we need to do our part to lower our carbon footprint. For the past decade, we have gotten better at designing more energy efficient buildings and trying to use renewable sources. We’ve used wind turbines, solar in a number of buildings, and built a microgrid at one of our properties, Marcus Garvey Apartments. In Harlem, we are now constructing the city’s largest residential affordable housing development ever built to Passive House standards. As a firm, it’s really important to us. We are long-term owners, we are developers, and we’re our own general contractor.We are willing to put in a few extra dollars on the front end with the expectation that we’re going to see some cost savings down the road. I think a lot of the policies that the city is implementing tend to be more of a stick rather than a carrot. I was speaking to someone recently and they were surprised that our numbers are a little bit higher than they thought. Part of it is that we are designing for the future of Local Law 97 so that we don’t end up in a position 15 years from now where we’re paying large fines because our buildings are carbon intensive. And as for myself, my particular expertise within L+M is related to acquisitions and rehabilitations. It’s important to the city to try to make older buildings more efficient. It’s quite challenging, but we do whatever we can to upgrade and change the infrastructure and to make it more energy efficient for the future. A lot of it also has to do with air quality. Bringing in fresh air and better air quality really has made a difference. I think some of our residents don’t know why things feel better, but they do feel better. MT: Are there certain policies that would help incentivize low carbon retrofits that keep buildings affordable? JM: Yes, there are some NYSERDA funds out there, but I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg. These things do cost more money. If you’re buying an existing building to renovate, after you get over the initial construction costs, and you start making repairs, there’s not a lot in your budget to do extra work to make the building more energy efficient. Being able to tap into some subsidy or low-cost loans at the city or state level would really help. New Jersey has some really great incentive programs for solar right now that are better than New York City. It’s also incumbent upon the government to look to other government agencies or other places to see what’s working better. We have found that even with building to Passive House standards, lender underwriting is not keeping pace with the savings. MT: What are the challenges in prioritizing both equity and carbon in the built environment? JM: Even on new construction, there are definitely systems that are more expensive than others. The premium to build something to Passive House standards is somewhere between five and ten percent. That could be the difference between making a profit and not. At the end of the day, there’s a budget. Where do you find the money to do it? At some point in time, someone’s going to build market rate housing to Passive House standards and get premium rents because people want to live in it because of their values, the better air quality, and the lower utility bills. That market-driven dynamic doesn’t exist on the affordable side. HPD has their term sheet with subsidy levels and you’re trying to always fit into that. A lot of times, with the additional costs to build to Passive House standards, you need additional subsidy beyond what the city is willing to allocate. It’s not always the case, but it makes it harder and you’re cobbling together more sources of funds. I think less sophisticated developers are going to struggle. Courtesy L+M Development Partners MT: Is there a mixed-income scenario that could make building a multifamily development to Passive House standards more appealing financially? JM: I think you can do mixed income, and even some of the affordable Passive House developments have higher tiers of incomes so the rents are higher. There are developers that are willing to put more equity in a deal knowing that there’ll be more cash flow down the road. We’re willing to do that and put up more cash, or we’ll defer more of our fee because we know that we’re going to get operational savings when we build to Passive House standards. I’m just not sure everyone will do that, but if you take the cost side and rent everything at 60% of AMI and below, it’s going to be really difficult. If you have a tiered mixed income, where you’ve got between 40% and 120% of an AMI, it’s easier to make those work even if you can’t get a premium rent because your rents are restricted. It’s going to be interesting to see if market rate developers start moving down the path of building to Passive House standards. It’s going to be interesting to see if market rate developers start moving down the path of building to Passive House standards. Does a building like that get a premium in rent? I would like to think so. MT: Our team has been studying the case for upzoning a neighborhood like Soho/Noho, where the strength of the market may be an opportunity for sustainable mixed-income housing development. Do you think upzoning can be a useful tool to expand the number of low carbon affordable units? I think your hypothesis is correct. If you’re in a neighborhood like that, while land prices would go up with a rezoning, you would probably be able to support more sustainable building with affordability in it through market rents. But we’ve been beat up a lot on zoning and upzoning, so I’m probably not the most optimistic person at any sort of rezoning that will happen in those neighborhoods. If you look at recent history with rezonings around the city, with few exceptions, they just keep getting shut down. No one seems to want more density in their neighborhood.. For example, at Marcus Garvey Apartments, we were developing seven vacant lots. This is a transit oriented, all affordable development, which was a perfect story for the Mayor’s housing plan. We came in with a plan to build seven buildings between 10 and 12 stories, and received pushback from the community and ended up having buildings between five and seven stories, with lots of setbacks and parking requirements. We ended up building about half the amount of affordable housing we could have. While there is general agreement in the city for the need to increase the amount of quality affordable housing, there’s a movement at the local level to not allow density and tall buildings. MT: If you could wave a magic wand and have all of those barriers and current zoning restrictions go away, in what parts of New York City would you dream of building affordable and low carbon multifamily developments? JM: I think you would want to do it everywhere. Ideally, you get away from putting it all in the same neighborhood—there’s fear of gentrification in lower income neighborhoods and some of that is well-founded. You don’t really want to concentrate your low-income housing in those neighborhoods. I would say I’d want to focus on the island of Manhattan. I live on the Upper West Side—why couldn’t they make it such that if you want an additional floor area bonus, you had to put in 20% affordable? Also, I’d want to focus where there are good schools. We tend to build affordable housing in neighborhoods with low performing and underfunded schools. Why shouldn’t a low income family live in my neighborhood and go to the good public schools in TriBeCa or the Upper East Side? MT: One idea you mentioned was giving FAR bonuses for increasing the number of affordable units in the development. Do you think it would be possible to require a certain carbon performance to get this policy incentive that drives both carbon and affordability goals? JM: At the end of the day, I guess it’s not just FAR, it’s also height restrictions. If you give a developer a bonus to build more and build higher, those upper apartments are worth a lot more money, so they’re making more money. Forcing them to meet some sort of sustainability metrics, as well as affordability, would seem like a no brainer. Think about all the value that the city creates for land owners when they built the Highline or the Second Avenue subway. There is enormous value created, but it’s not always captured. If you make it such that the incentive is worth it, then they’ll do it. Maybe there are other things too, like common community benefit money that goes to help out a local public school or fix a park. There are a lot of things you can do, but I think some municipalities have gone overboard with some of these requirements. There needs to be a balance as you run the risk that the requirements make it infeasible to build. MT: How do you feel about neighborhoods being able to create carbon performance requirements for buildings that developers would have to adhere to in order to construct a building in that area? JM: Conceptually it is a good idea but I fear that neighborhoods that don’t want any new development will put in incredibly stringent requirements, so no one will build anything new. In my mind, a lot of it has to be market driven too. Mandating things and putting in strict requirements sometimes has unintended consequences. By creating incentives and giving people bonuses for doing certain things, you’ll get more creative developers and more people probably latching on than you would otherwise. That’s what I would encourage our policymakers to think about. Jeffrey Moelis began his career with L+M twelve years ago when he co-founded C+C Apartment Management, the management affiliate of L+M.

8,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Will Thomas,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-will-thomas/,"December 11, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City.

Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Will Thomas, Member of Open New York, accompanies Just Climate, Just Housing. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Renée Crowley: Can you tell us a little bit about Open New York and what their mission is? Will Thomas: Open New York focuses on allowing more housing in high opportunity neighborhoods. We see that being as important for equity reasons, for affordability reasons, for environmental reasons. Usually, we advocate for two swords. We’ll show up for individual ULURPs in Bronx or Brooklyn or Manhattan or western Queens. Generally, we try to focus our advocacy on higher opportunity neighborhoods, so wealthy neighborhoods, transit rich neighborhoods, neighborhoods with good schools. We also advocate for neighborhood rezonings as well. When we started, we were focusing mainly on those individual projects. We’ve also advocated for the Gowanus rezoning as well as the Soho/Noho rezoning. Unfortunately, those are the only two neighborhood rezonings that have been proposed for wealthy neighborhoods, but we’re hoping that will change obviously. RC: Could you talk about Open New York’s position on the Soho/Noho upzoning? WT: The city essentially started this process with the aim of just legalizing retail. We went to the original rezoning hearings and they weren’t pushing housing. I think it’s clear in other places like Southern Boulevard, or Bushwick, that the city representatives came strictly to advocate for housing. In Soho at the meetings, it was pretty evident that what they wanted to legalize retail, which is kind of odd that retail isn’t legal in Soho. We thought it was ridiculous that the city was planning on rezoning two of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country without that housing focus, without any plans for increased density or affordable housing. The mayor has been pushing those rezonings in Bushwick and in Southern Boulevard where the council members are obviously opposed. By contrast, Margaret Chin hasn’t taken a position on Soho at all, so it was this big opportunity that we were leaving on the table. We attended these meetings and it was clear we weren’t going to see the progress that we wanted to see within the process that they had set up. In July, we decided to go outside the process a little bit and release our own plan. We essentially proposed two separate rezonings—one is outside the historic district and the other is inside. Outside the historic district, we planned to rezone more generously to allow sort of the same densities that are allowed in Yorkville on the Upper East Side. Within the historic district, we realized there was a lot we could still work with given that the existing buildings in Soho are actually quite dense. We proposed allowing new construction on non-conforming sites to the density of the densest building on the block. We found that those two proposals together, both the more generous rezoning outside the historic district and the more limited rezoning within the historic district, would deliver 3,400 units of housing and almost 700 units of deeply affordable housing. RC: How do we prioritize housing for the population of workers in the Soho/Noho area? What kind of mechanism could be put in place to meet their needs? WT: We started from the point of wanting to expand the community preference proposal because we’ve heard a lot of criticism about it. When it’s in these very wealthy neighborhoods, you’re preserving a lot of affordable housing strictly for people who were already in those neighborhoods. A lot of times, that means that NYU students, because their income levels are technically low, get preference in affordable housing compared to people who are working in retail shops in Soho. The proposal was to open it up to all of Margaret Chin’s district so that people in the Lower East Side and in Chinatown would definitively be able to get preference for it. It is ridiculous that people who work in these neighborhoods don’t get preference for the affordable housing in it. It is tricky in that people do change jobs. However, a big motivating factor was that building more affordable housing in high opportunity neighborhoods might mean that a job change might be a change for the better. When your commute is much shorter, and you’re much closer to Midtown and the financial district, maybe you can get a higher paying job somewhere else. RC: Why is it important to upzone a neighborhood? What’s the big takeaway message from doing this? WT: I think there are three major opportunities that we get from upzoning Soho. The key benefit is integration—Soho is 72% white and the median income is well over $100K. We have demographic analyses that show that upzoning would increase the low-income people living at Soho by 40%. In terms of education, in Soho and Noho have the best school district in the city, according to the Furman Center. When you’re opening up the neighborhood, you’re giving 700 families the chance to enroll in that excellent school. There are also environmental benefits—you have 3,400 households in an incredibly transit rich neighborhood. This is a region of Manhattan where the subways are under capacity. It’s a very natural place to allow growth. You won’t have as many people driving from Staten Island, so it’s a huge improvement on in terms of emissions. Soho/Noho are also very important in terms of symbols. We see it is as very important to change the politics of development. The administration has only upsold low-income and gentrifying neighborhoods. They do this because they see wealthy neighborhoods as being politically impossible to upzone. Asking for an industrial neighborhood to take all the city’s growth has understandably generated a lot of resentment, but it’s not getting us the housing. Showing that this can happen in both rich and poorer neighborhoods would be very meaningful. RC: What would you say is a high opportunity neighborhood? How do you clarify that and what your criteria? WT: We have understood it to be a loose metric of whether the median income is above that of the average for New York City. We haven’t defined it super strictly. I think everyone would agree that Soho and Noho are high opportunity neighborhoods, in addition to the other neighborhoods that we’ve advocated for like Kips Bay and Boerum Hill. They all have very high income and amazing schools. As we turn our advocacy to more of the city, I think we’ll define what high opportunity means more strictly. RC: Does your team have any neighborhoods that you’ve considered working with that could be the next? WT: We have discussed the Village and Tribeca, which is right next to Soho. I think all of brownstone Brooklyn as well. There are other neighborhoods that aren’t as well served by transit, like Bayside. There are a lot of neighborhoods that can be doing a lot better, from Greenwich Village to Bay Ridge. Both of these neighborhoods aren’t building anywhere close to the amount of housing that Bushwick is even without a rezoning. RC: What are the major opposition points that folks in the community bring up about the Soho/Noho plan, or in general on upzoning in wealthy neighborhoods? WT: In Soho, the major two points of opposition are local homeowners and organized in groups like the Soho Alliance and the Bowery Alliance of Neighbors. There are also preservationists like the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. Their major motivation is preserving the character of the neighborhood and local property values play into that. We went to a community board hearing and recorded the co-chair of Community Board 2 saying, “With all the historic character of the neighborhood, I don’t think Soho should be as responsible in terms of building more affordable housing as other neighborhoods.” I think that captured a lot— the important thing is protecting the history rather than expanding opportunity. Even beyond that, people don’t want the subways to get more crowded and people don’t want the schools to be more crowded. It’s a classic opportunity hoarding playbook. RC: If we’re going to be able to upzone the neighborhood, build new buildings, or renovate existing buildings to be compliant with the city’s goal to reduce energy and carbon production by 2050, what does that look like? WT: There are a lot of us within Open New York that strongly support sustainable building. In order to get that sustainable building, we need to first allow building. Newer buildings are much more energy efficient and environmentally friendly than even retrofitting an older building would be. Enabling density is a first step—it’s important alongside strengthening those regulations and it might help also to expand some regulations of older buildings. We want to look at per capita emissions metrics. If we were to double New York’s population, we probably blow past our current emissions in total. But our national emissions would likely plummet because New Yorkers have 30% of the carbon emissions of the average American. Having the right measuring stick is very important here. Right now, the current development that is happening nationally is that the Sunbelt is exploding in places like Phoenix and Tampa. They are rapidly sprawling and creating these terrible infrastructure messes that we’ll be living with for 30 years. Even without reform to New York’s building regulations, allowing for high rise development would decrease carbon emissions and could redirect the sprawl in this city. There are improvements that we could make in terms of our regulations, but it’s always important to have in mind what’s currently happening RC: Has Open New York referred to any other cities or neighborhoods that have been adopting pretty progressive policies or practices? WT: The big one is Minneapolis and how they got rid of single-family zoning—that’s a big example of how we might use comprehensive planning. LA has a robust transit-oriented development program. In California more broadly, in terms of statewide initiatives, they have EDU laws that have pried open exclusionary suburbs. Also, Massachusetts has a really interesting anti-snob zoning law, which I think is how most development happens in a lot of cities, unfortunately—that is a more of an equitable solution. The Mount Laurel court system in New Jersey opened up a lot of exclusionary subgroups as well. I think these examples show that these issues need to be addressed on a statewide plan, as opposed to on the individual council district level. Will Thomas is one of seven board members at Open New York, an all-volunteer, independent, pro-housing nonprofit.

9,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Gretchen West,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-gretchen-west/,"December 10, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Gretchen West, Executive Director of Healthy Homes, accompanies Design as Preventative Care. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Amritha Mahesh: What is the mission of Healthy Homes? What was the impetus for the hospital to start this initiative? Gretchen West: Healthy Homes is an affordable housing nonprofit that was established by Nationwide Children’s Hospital and the local community development corporation, Community Development for All People, in 2008, in response to the widespread foreclosure crisis, which caused a huge amount of vacant, abandoned dilapidated homes in the neighborhood just south of the hospital’s main campus. Healthy Homes was established primarily to address vacancy by buying those homes, fully rehabbing them, and then offering them as affordable homeownership opportunities. In conjunction, we also started a home repair program where we provided grants to existing homeowners to do exterior improvements to their home up to $20,000. In 2017, we established a rental program in response to what we believed was impending gentrification of the neighborhood. Private investment has come back to the community and was causing housing pricing to skyrocket. We still do homeownership, but it’s at a much smaller scale. Now we are mostly developing affordable rental properties, and we still do our home repair program. AM: How does the funding for these initiatives work? GW: That has changed over time. During the Obama administration, in response to a large amount of foreclosed properties, HUD’s Neighborhood Stabilization Program channeled money to states and municipalities for groups like ours to buy vacant homes, rehab them, and sell them as owner-occupied or lease-to-own. For the first three to four years, we received funding through NSP. When we do rehabs, there is always a gap between the cost of doing a full gut rehab and what we sell the home for. We’re never making money when we sell a home. In some cases, that was fully covered by the hospital. We also have some private philanthropy dollars. AM: In terms of how things are structured and working currently, do you see any challenges? Are there other avenues that you’d like to explore or new policy programs? GW: In 2018, we announced the South Side Renaissance Fund, which is $15 million loan fund that the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing built for us. We are now using that fund to do what we hope will be about 130 units over the next two and a half years. Most of those will be scattered-site, single families and duplexes on the south side. AM: Have you remained focused on the census tracts around the hospital over time, or you are seeing this expand? GW: We originally started in just one census tract just south of the hospital. We are now in seven or eight census tracts that are all very close to the hospital’s main campus. AM: How is the city of Columbus involved with these efforts? GW: Second only to the hospital, they are our largest contributor in terms of funding to get projects done. In addition to NSP, we draw down HOME funds for rental construction and unrestricted city bond funds. Those funds fill a lot of gaps for us in order to complete housing. AM: How do these efforts relate to the goal of improving social and economic determinants of health and addressing blight? GW: It depends on who you ask. Our goal is to improve children’s health. We have some preliminary data that we’re hoping to release later this year that shows that children from the geographic areas in which our housing is built are going to the emergency room less frequently and spending less time in the hospital for inpatient stays. However, the data shows that those less frequent visits are marginal. We’re not tracking the health of individual folks living in just our housing; we haven’t done that and we aren’t doing that. It is hard to say how much of an impact our housing has had on individual people. Right now we are only measuring at the neighborhood level. AM: What protections are in place for tenants for rent and affordability levels? GW: First, we have leases that prohibit us from raising rents on people except for once a year when their previous lease ends. We do raise rents 2% every year because expenses go up every year. We’re not making any money on this, but at the very minimum, the we don’t want to lose money. Rents tend to go up about $15 to $20 per month per year. For the units where we have taken HOME funds from the city that come from HUD, there are very specific terms for the maximum allowable rental rate. AM: What role does the CDC play as a partner? GW: The CDC has been vital to our success. They were doing some housing work in 2008 before this even started and I think that what attracted the hospital to them is that they have an expertise in this field. They also bring a lot of credibility to our work because they are so strongly rooted in the community. They do a lot of direct services. They have a fresh produce mart. They have a free store. They have a lot of direct services where they see over 22,000 people come through their doors in a year. They use their social services and direct services to form relationships with people. It’s not just, “Here’s your free food and you can leave now.” It’s, “Hey, how are you?” There’s a relationship. It’s through that relationship that they’re able to understand clearly what folks in this community need and desire. When the hospital formed this relationship, they brought a lot of validity to our work. I can tell you in 2009, when I was knocking on people’s doors, trying to get people to sign up for our home repair program, I had a lot of people tell me to get off the front porch. It’s only through saying, “Hey, I work at the CDC” that folks were more trusting of who we were. AM: We’ve touched on some of the data and metrics that you’re currently tracking. Is there other data you would like to be tracking in the future to help with decision-making? GW: That’s a really good question. I’m sure there’s something I would like them to be tracking, but I rely very heavily on the hospital’s research team to figure that out. I’m more consumed with trying to get projects across the finish line, which is becoming harder and harder. I’m more consumed with trying to get projects across the finish line, which is becoming harder and harder. I think the hospital would love to be able to track other things besides children’s health outcome data. The hospital is in charge of the care of 300,000 Medicaid children in Columbus and the surrounding region, so we have access to this data. But we do not have access to the data for adults. It’s been really hard getting the adult systems to agree to that kind of shared data. AM: What are some of the lessons learned since the program came into existence nearly 12 years ago? GW: In retrospect, I wish we had acquired more properties before the private market decided this was the hot place to be. Things would be a lot easier for us right about now, but we became the victims of our own success and didn’t anticipate it would change so rapidly. There was a period of twelve months where all of a sudden housing had become hard to come by at the prices that we need to acquire things for. I wish we would have planned better when it came to that. AM: Looking ahead, what are some of the longer term goals for the program? GW: I mentioned that the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing built a $15 million loan fund for us. We’re about halfway through the time period we have to spend those funds and the end is coming up very soon. I am worried we might not make it, knowing how long it takes to get a funding review by the City of Columbus and to get other partners to come together before you can actually go build something. It’s become a mad dash. Gretchen West serves as the Executive Director of Healthy Homes, a nonprofit housing organization and collaboration between Community Development for All People and Nationwide Children’s Hospital. The goal of Healthy Homes is to provide high-quality, affordable housing throughout Columbus, Ohio. Gretchen leads the housing team responsible for managing the homeownership, rental, and home repair programs. Since 2008, more than 375 housing units have been improved, representing an investment of $33 million. Gretchen has been with Healthy Homes since its inception, starting as an AmeriCorps VISTA worker. Gretchen earned a bachelor’s degree and a Master of City and Regional Planning from The Ohio State University. Header image credit: Dan DeLuca va Flickr"
10,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Nupur Chaudhury,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-napur-chaudhury/,"December 3, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Napur Chaudury, Program Officer for the New York State Health Foundation, accompanies Design as Preventative Care. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Catherine Joseph: In your current work, how do you bring together your expertise across urban planning and public health? Nupur Chaudhury: I have a background in both urban planning and public health. For the past 10 years I’ve worked mostly within the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut regions to think through the intersections of urban planning, urban design built environment work and how that affects health. In my current role at the New York State Health Foundation, I allocate funding to specific neighborhoods based on health disparities and also by identifying community based organizations that may not necessarily have a health background, but have a background and connection with specific residents, specific community organizations, and are able to leverage and organize in a way that health systems won’t be able to. CJ: We have found that communicating among disciplines can be tricky, in part because people use different definitions of the same word. Have come across any sort of best practices for communicating across public health and urban planning? NC: What I have found to be effective is being able to talk about the work in very, very straightforward terms, so that people don’t get tied up in any sort of jargon or acronyms. When talking to people who are not health professionals, saying that where you live actually affects how long you live is a pretty dramatic statistic. When talking to people who are not health professionals, saying that where you live actually affects how long you live is a pretty dramatic statistic. When talking to people who are not health professionals, saying that where you live actually affects how long you live is a pretty dramatic statistic. And it’s very different to say that than to say that there are disparities and health outcomes as related to specific zip codes. As a health funder, it is important to state that we know that health is defined very little by the healthcare system, and much more by all of the spaces and places where people live, work, play, pray, and spend time in general. Therefore, we need to be investing in other spaces, because we know that will get the biggest bang for our buck. I could say that in a completely differently way, but if you state it in the most direct way, I’ve found you get the most direct results. Eileen Chen: Could you tell us about your work with the City’s Health Action Centers? What was the vision behind that initiative? NYU Langone NC: Commissioner [Mary] Bassett, the former health commissioner, was really interested in reactivating buildings owned by the Health Department across the city to provide a space for co-location, so that the Health Department could work shoulder-to-shoulder with key community-based organizations and provide a space for residents to utilize the building in certain ways. We completed an analysis of the location of these buildings and found that the buildings that weren’t being utilized to their highest and best use were in the neighborhoods that had the lowest health outcomes in the city. There was also an opportunity to be working on health in different ways. The buildings were in the South Bronx, East Harlem, and Central Brooklyn. The Health Department had District Public Health Offices (DPHOs) for specific regions, and each DPHO had a specific focus. Central Brooklyn at that time was focused on maternal and infant mortality. East Harlem was focused on asthma. The South Bronx was focused on teen pregnancy. In addition to co-location, what would it look like if, within the lease agreements providing subsidized rent for these community-based organizations, we made it a requirement that folks had to work together to develop a health priority plan for the neighborhood? And how do we measure success around that? So, for 18 months, I was part of the team that got funding from the Mayor’s office to explore this. We opened up one of the Health Action Centers in Harlem, one in the Bronx, one in central Brooklyn. There are plans to open more because there are a couple more buildings. I think it’ll depend on the city administration. It was an approach to health that asked what it would look like if the government, federally-qualified health clinics, nonprofits and community members collaborated to achieve specific health outcomes. CJ: It sounds like those goals were similar to the state’s goals with DSRIP, which we know was recently denied an extension by the federal government.. For those who may not know, could you explain how DSRIP worked? NC: DSRIP, which stands for Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment, was a pilot program that included New York State and a few other states across the country. The overall goal was rethinking Medicaid. The way that the health system is set up here in the US, every single time you walk through the doors for medical care, a physician gets paid. The goal was to rethink that incentive of the per visit payment, because every single time you walk through the health systems doors, it means that you are still unwell, you still have that diagnosis or you have a flare up of the chronic disease you were treated for the last time. Instead of incentivizing people to come back and come back and come back for treatment, how do you get them to not come back because they are better? DSIRP was a payment system that was not based on visits, but was based on the value of care. A single visit to a health system or a doctor prevents the next visit, which means that that health system gets paid more. The idea of DSRIP is that the health system gets paid more because they did their job. To set up DSRIP, they identified hospital systems across the state to serve as the PPSs, the Performing Provider Systems. Each PPS had to make a decision about what aspect to focus on during the life of the DSRIP program. For example, the focus might be reduced emergency room admissions related to asthma flare ups or reduced emergency room admissions related to chronic diabetes care. The PPSs were encouraged to work with nonprofits and community-based organizations that could support their goals—that was a very, very, very progressive and different approach. Five years ago, the health systems had their own programs for diabetes management or asthma management. And community-based organizations had, for example, community health workers making home visits. Typically, the health systems and community-based organizations informed each other about their work, but they didn’t really work together. The state encouraging that collaboration through DSRIP was a huge step toward acknowledging the influence that community-based organizations and nonprofits have on health. DSRIP also provided the ability to pay those nonprofits for the health-related work that they were doing. Usually NGOs come to someone like me, a program officer at a foundation, for funding. To get money from a health system to be able to do that work was pretty awesome. CJ: What were some of the issues with DSRIP, that we know at this time? Could it be adapted in another form in the future and what adaptations would make it particularly attractive? NC: A challenge for a large-scale program like this is determining how to measure impact. In this case, they were trying to figure out whether or not they could reduce the utilization of emergency rooms. Inherently, that means patients must be tracked, and you need to have a strong level of data management. Health systems were able to do the tracking, primarily because they are already built to do that. It was a lot more complicated for community-based organizations, because community-based organizations had to prove to the health system that the work could be done, but without the initial investment. At some smaller community-based organizations, there is barely enough money for a Windows upgrade, let alone an entire database management system. When health systems started approaching community-based organizations and asking a lot of questions—”I understand that you guys are running an exercise program. How many people come? Where do they live? How often do they come? Are they repeat exercisers taking their vitals?”—the community-based organizations were not prepared and didn’t have the capacity to have that information before receiving money. Nor did they receive the funding that was needed, at the speed that it was needed, to build the capacity to be able to provide that data. Nonprofits and community-based organizations felt that although their work in public health had been identified, they were still not being provided the resources that they needed to do the work. Nonprofits and community-based organizations felt that although their work in public health had been identified, they were still not being provided the resources that they needed to do the work. The clearest example of this is God’s Love We Deliver, a large nonprofit that provides meal delivery services throughout New York City. They were able to build up their database management system and essentially build out a DSRIP team. And they still couldn’t get on a contract with a PPS. The good thing about DSRIP was that the state has started thinking about health in a different way; the bad thing was that the state wasn’t able to provide resources to the groups that could help them do the work. Eileen Chen: We have learned about a long-standing working partnership between Mount Sinai Hospital and Little Sisters of Assumption (LSA), a nonprofit that works in East Harlem, where specific departments at Mount Sinai can direct funding to LSA, which does work such as retrofits and repairs in the homes of asthma sufferers. Does this kind of partnership sound atypical to you? NC: I don’t think it’s atypical, but it is not the norm, which is a challenge. Sometimes it happens but it’s not a requirement. How partnerships are funded and how they are implemented is piecemeal. When it does happen, it is because the health system decides it is something they would like to pursue for a specific reason, not because it is something that health systems see as their charge to do. Even when you do have a certain percentage of required action or investment in the community, there isn’t a lot of regulation around how effective that investment is. Is a community health center more effective than an outreach program around stroke awareness, for example? There isn’t a lot of data on that. For DSRIP, one of the exciting aspects was that they had to show how the investment was improving health outcomes, how much it was changing the numbers. Amritha Mahesh: We came across quite a few examples of healthcare providers partnering with or forming development subsidiaries. Do you think that type of model would work in New York City, given the challenges with land availability and acquisition costs? NC: It’s an entirely different scenario in New York City. There is a conversation happening nationally asking how hospitals can act as anchor institutions in neighborhoods. That conversation is largely absent from New York City because of the sheer density of the city. But that conversation is really interesting. It helps us to start asking, “Okay, if we are the largest procurer of food, what are ways we can be more responsible around what we’re purchasing? If we are the largest employer, if we were to do work around worksite wellness, the effect in the neighboring communities is completely different than if we were just one employer out of many.” Nupur Chaudhury is a bridge builder and translator in the fields of urban planning and public health.

11,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Jennifer McDonnell,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-jennifer-mcdonnell/,"December 3, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Jennifer McDonnell, Resource Recovery Program Manager for the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, accompanies Circular Systems. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Rebecca Macklis: Could give a quick introduction to yourself and speak to how you entered the sustainability and circular systems world? Jennifer McDonnell: I have been in the field of what I call resource recovery for about 15 years. I had a bit of a circuitous route to my current role, which is as the resource recovery program manager for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). My job here is to develop programs to recover the resources within the scope of our operations, which are water and wastewater treatment for NYC. I primarily focus on biosolids here at DEP. As the backstory of how I got to DEP, I recently came from a company that was in the biosolids management industry serving 85 customers on the East Coast making all different kinds of biosolids and residuals that we worked to recover. Prior to that, I was the, so-called, Green Mission Specialist, for Whole Foods Market in the Northeast region – loose translation is that I was the environmental coordinator. There, I worked on recycling and composting programs at the retail stores. I started in retail, got interested in food resource recovery, ended up in a food waste recovery company that actually was a biosolids management company first and foremost, and then became really interested in biosolids, and then came to DEP. RM: For those who aren’t familiar with biosolids resource recovery, would you be able to give your elevator pitch of what that is? JM: Sure. Biosolids are the solid byproduct of wastewater treatment, in the sense that they result from the processes within a treatment facility. Advanced wastewater treatment, which is what’s in place in New York City, is a multi-step process that involves physics, chemistry, and biology, with the ultimate goal of cleaning water and returning it to the waterways. As part of that process solids are separated. Those solids can be recovered as a resource – for energy, nutrients, and more. RM: Great. Thinking of how the world of biosolids is plugged into circular systems thinking, can you provide background on how you interpret circular systems thinking, and how your experience, both at DEP and your previous experience at Whole Foods, has helped you inform how you approach the topic of biosolids as part of this larger puzzle? In short, do you view biosolids as one sphere of circular systems thinking, or part of a larger whole? JM: At the heart of my personal passion on this resource recovery or circular systems thinking is efficiency, and in the acknowledgement that the resources around us have value, that everything has value in some context. The challenge is finding that value, realizing that value, and trying to use it in the most efficient way. Efficiency for me means both financial and logistical. I’m a fan of the McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry thinking which focuses on biological and technical nutrients, and trying to keep things in their cycles. The concept of “resource optimization” is the fundamental way I approach the topic of circularity, both in the work that I did before and here at DEP. It’s astonishing how much energy and effort we put into moving things around rather than thinking of ways to use what we have. Perhaps a simplified way of putting that circular thinking into context; when you think about everything in the modern conveniences of life, how much stuff that you consume is actually produced near you? How much is recovered near you? Very little. Biosolids are an example of this. In NYC, they are produced locally and shipped “away.” RM: Expanding upon that and looking to opportunities for further efficiency, could you provide an example of an approach or principle that you utilize in your current role? And perhaps speak on an approach that you are utilizing in your current role that you wish you had in your past private sector roles, and vice versa? JM: One thing that is very important to the planning that we’re doing now is using the same concepts familiar in our world but applying them in different ways. For sustainable biosolids management we realize that we’re going to need diversity. We’re going to need a lot of different uses and different products. So diversity but not in the way maybe most commonly thought of, as in of people. The city makes a lot of biosolids, every day, and we need to be creatively thinking about all the different ways that we can use it rather than an all eggs in one basket approach. That’s something that I’m using now and that I wasn’t as aware of in past roles. In my private sector work I was involved in a number of successful partnerships. This is much more difficult in the government sector. There’s movement, I’d say in governments – not just New York City – to tap into “public private partnerships”, particularly as we go into this more circular economy and try to engage with functions that are outside the core functions of government. I think government in general is kind of siloed, and that does not lend to a circle. I think it’s fair to say that the private sector is a little more nimble in partnering and figuring out business relationships, and that’s not the same structure that government utilities work in. RM: Would you say that that ability to be nimble and partner cross-sector and cost discipline is one of the biggest roadblocks standing in the way of expanding this type of practice? Or is that just one piece of the puzzle? JM: I think it’s really just one puzzle piece. A larger one is the way that the economic drivers exist in our society, and that’s translated into demand for products. Aside from biosolids, yet a similar story, is other commodity recycling. For example, glass. There’s not a high demand for recovered glass, it’s cheaper, often, to make new glass. And cumbersome and challenging to recover used glass for reuse and recycling. For biosolids, an example would be trying to tap into its value as fertilizer. It may not necessarily be cheaper to get “virgin” or fossil based fertilizers, but the whole distribution system is set up around them. The governing rules are set up around their use, and the farmers are comfortable using them so it becomes a herculean effort of shifting entire circles within the economy. RM: You speak about these larger networks and relationships of supply and demand. Taking a broader look at these topics perhaps outside of the lens of biosolids and resource recovery, can you speak to an approach that you would suggest for regular folks across the city that would like to engage in these topics and help move the needle? Or perhaps to others working in the city but not directly engaging in these systems? JM: It definitely requires cross sector collaboration and leaders within those sectors that are willing and able to collaborate. A design thinking exercise would be to look at our assets in place and how we can transform them. How can we use what we already have? That’s a very circular thinking approach to solving problems and that’s what DEP can do with the wastewater facilities – how can we optimize them? Can we put food waste into the digesters and get more gas? Yes we can, let’s do that. RM: You mentioned political movement and incentive. Could you speak more about the political movements required for this in addition to the social movements. Can you speak to how communications ties into this thinking, both how the government and City agencies are communicating our thinking about these topics, and how the general public is being communicated to about these topics? JM: Different types of communication are going to resonate with different groups. In order to be effective, you’re going to have to have a multitude of communication styles and mediums that can reach different audiences to resonate with them, whatever that means for that group. That’s really challenging, especially in a very diverse urban environment, and New York City is exactly that. In the work I did with food waste recovery, prior to coming to DEP, it was such a challenge to communicate to people what was compostable; it kind of blew my mind. It was one of the most frustrating things for me – I didn’t understand why people didn’t understand. I was trying to retrain folks who had been indoctrinated to throw stuff “away”. “Why can’t you put the bag of food in the trash?” Which is ironic because there is now technology that will separate the food from the packaging so that line has been blurred, but back when I was doing this education role for Whole Foods, that was bad and we couldn’t get it right. We tried communicating all different ways; different languages, images, in-person training, buddy systems. If we’re talking about communicating to get people to change behavior, you somehow have to find something that makes them want to do it, a motivating factor. RM: Yeah, we have heard that line of “motivating factor” when speaking to others as well. To your point, some of the lines are blurred and it is complicated. I myself did a tour of the Sims Recycling Facility I think last spring, and it wasn’t until I did that tour that realized that compostable things aren’t actually recyclable. JM: Yeah, it is complex and it’s very hard to communicate all these things. I think one of my personal challenges is that I want to be the best, I want to do the most, but my career has taught me that sometimes good enough is really good and better than not at all. Accepting less than perfect because perfect is not possible. I had a taxation professor who drove home the point that simplicity is at the expense of equity. It’s kind of the same thing with resource recovery, simplicity is at the expense of granularity – but in that space it’s better to get great participation on milk jugs and aluminum cans than try to have everyone know what to do with everything. That’s one approach. RM: To your point, as a group our preliminary exploration of this topic seemed to show that a general social roadblock to this movement is that people get really jazzed about these ideas and want to do them, and then it seems so hard in the current environment to get to the perfect solution that the solution ends up being not necessarily mobilizing at all. Would you say that’s correct? JM: Yeah, or they start arguing about what’s the best way, and get stuck on that and fail to move forward. RM: On the flip side, for the skeptic conversation, which we talked a little bit about offline as well, what do you think is the most successful way, or what have you found successful approaches to try to sway skeptics that these systems are worth the investment and behavior change? Does this convincing require a communications game again, a political movement, financial movement, social movement, all of the above? JM: I think it’s probably all the above. I was reading an article earlier today about the federal government telling states that if you don’t move people out of the floodplain we’re not going to give you money for resiliency. You think about whose responsibility it becomes to communicate with those people who must relocate. They are the ones who are going to lose, who are not happy with the result and you can’t blame them really. When I think this through, conceptually I’m on board with the idea that we should not continue to invest in areas where it’s not worth it; we’ve lost the battle. Why would we do that? But then I try to put on those people’s shoes and say well how would I feel if the Army Corps was coming to me and telling me that I had to leave? I don’t know how I would feel. I’m not sure that really answers your question but for me it is an example that reminds me that transitions, especially big ones, are not easy. As far as communicating with skeptics, opposition to biosolids reuse has been an ongoing challenge ever since the Clean Water Act required biosolids to not be dumped in waterways. The answer is science and sharing facts. What has proven valuable in charged debates (and court cases) is having information validated by a trusted third party. Trust takes time and if you don’t have time, then it’s difficult. I didn’t start out a biosolids believer. Colleagues and mentors in the industry and years of following science and research made me one. I imagine this would apply for private sector corporations who have things to “lose” as well – such as the fossil fuel industry. It’s probably easier for someone with a seat at their table to say, ‘hey, let’s get behind this’ rather than feeling like it’s coming from the outside. Maybe it’s too emotional for some people, emotional decision making is another aspect. That said, I think compassion goes a long way, and back to communicating, to understanding the different values that each party is trying to maintain. That said, I think compassion goes a long way, and back to communicating, to understanding the different values that each party is trying to maintain. Maybe the surface appearance of what’s important really isn’t the underlying thing. It’s taking the time to analyze that and get to the bottom of it. Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. Courtesy NYC Water via Flickr RM: Definitely. And can you expand on some of the ways that DEP is doing that now, or how you’re doing that in your current role, as far as analyzing bottom line values, priorities, and co-benefits? JM: Well for biosolids we are exploring the concept of partnering – within the limitations that exist. We’re engaging with the industry. We’ve hired someone to help us with that process as we go about it in an open and fair manner to have conversations with service providers to develop solutions. For example, we need market capacity for biosolids recovery and it needs to be built. The industry needs to feel comfortable investing, or building something, with some security around a relationship with the City and other generators of biosolids. Biosolids is a global space– everybody poops. Some of the macro trends are positive and exciting as the industry continues to mature. Emerging technologies such as pyrolysis or gasification, or extracting elements from the solids – like phosphorus. That’s one that the industry talks about a lot. Another thing we are doing is connecting with colleagues globally and sharing information and ideas for innovation in resource recovery. The more traditional uses, e.g. compost or direct land application, are certainly things that are proven and beneficial and worth pursuing, but back to that diversity comment, the idea is to try to look at a number of different things as part of a robust program. RM: Where is the type of innovation coming from? JM: These technologies aren’t necessarily new, but based on what’s been happening with biosolids in the past decade or so as far as constrained landfill capacity and changing federal and state rules about some of the management techniques that used to be, “easier”, incineration being one of them, driving up management fees -there is a business opportunity. Technology that maybe 25-30 years ago was cost prohibitive. People wouldn’t invest R&D money in it, but that’s not really the case anymore. Rising prices are certainly a driver. Couple that with advancements in equipment and digitization of processes and monitoring – now some of these latent concepts are really taking off. RM: That speaks to what we were saying earlier, the mix -of political, financial, and social incentives; that mixed basket rumble. JM: When combined it’s quite effective to move the wheels forward. I would say the Regional Greenhouse Gas initiative is an interesting case study where the Northeast states banded together to try to limit emissions within their geography. I think there’ll be more models like this as people are trying to solve the climate problem. There really are a lot of people who are working on that. RM: What do you think is the most exciting example, or best example of these applied circular principles that people are working on now? JM: Our colleagues in the Netherlands at Waternet forged a public private partnership to make a face scrub out of calcite that was recovered from their water treatment residuals. Basically, a beauty product, and that’s a trending industry- that was super cool, and really my favorite right now. Although my work is focused in the organics resource recovery space, the glass people have been working hard too because there is a lot of glass in the system that is not being reused. There are some creative uses being worked on there – such as a medium for growing microorganisms. Another one is the use of plastics to make roads. A few examples of folks in the non-biological commodity space. I try to follow many industries for inspiration on what’s possible. RM: For these people that are innovating abroad or outside of New York City, what is preventing the direct application of this innovation within NYC? Can you speak to the overlaps and differences between where these things are happening and here in the city? JM: What keeps coming up, not surprisingly, is the personalities and leadership that advanced some of these concepts. You have to have these champions and cheerleaders, you’re not going to get there without it. People have to be committed and have the energy to put into it and the motivation. Public policies are certainly another effective driver. I don’t think there’s a shortage of those people, it’s just that they’re needed. I think that many of these shifts to circularity are not without headwinds, and you have to persevere and have the commitment to your goal. A lot of people that I run into, and internationally or otherwise in this line of work, they’re truly committed and passionate, that’s definitely a shared thing. The differences are sometimes cultural, sometimes political, and sometimes purely economical. RM: So what do you think the next steps are for DEP as an agency, you personally, and the city as a whole? Where do we, we go from here? JM: We’re going to have to enter into some new agreements, fundamentally different than those we’ve had before, to leverage the value of resources. Personally, I want to crack the code on the economics, policy, and communication combo that works to shift the role of public utilities in NYC into circularity. Personally, I want to crack the code on the economics, policy, and communication combo that works to shift the role of public utilities in NYC into circularity. I obviously can’t do this alone. I’m lucky to be part of a talented team – at DEP and in the City overall. We also must continue to talk. The more people who start to understand these concepts and want to advance them, even if you can’t advance them in your own personal work. I think a lot of real change happens at the grassroots level. RM: What advice would you give to those at a grassroots level currently struggling with a very linear economy that they’re trying to do something about either, in a different industry, different discipline, or in their own lives? JM: I guess I would say, you’re not alone. Don’t feel alone. I have to remind myself of is that incremental progress is progress. One of the hardest things for me and my career has been figuring out what that next step is, but the more you try to figure that out, the easier it gets. And you develop skill sets that help you figure out all kinds of different next steps. Is it meeting new people? Is it changing your point of view, is it going to a conference, is it focused thinking or finding someone else who’s done something that you can learn from? Is it talking it out with someone to help you figure out what that next step is? I think the next step is a tool that people may not realize. Figure out what that next step that is needed is and then you can move forward. Sometimes it takes a group to figure that out. RM: There are these systems in plain sight that people who aren’t in the industry, but who are looking for something to take and learn from, often don’t realize that some of these systems are already in play in their everyday life. Could you speak to one or a couple of these systems that are hiding in plain sight that people perhaps don’t realize that they’re engaging with? JM: Yeah, I think there’s an opportunity for us all to share more. We are all engaging with sharing opportunities. I carpool. I share my vegetables with my neighbors when we can’t use them. I share childcare with my fellow parents. I don’t know if it’s necessarily circular, but it starts to open your eyes to the interdependency of yourself on the world around you and being more open to those types of things. I think that can lead to more ideas and inspiration on what next steps might be. Interdependency is a foundation of circularity. I’m also a big fan of really thinking about every resource that becomes yours to manage and owning the responsibility of finding it its highest and best use. I say that and my apartment is not full of crap! I really try not to consume very much. If I need something, I want to really need it, and go out of my way to get it (I do not Amazon) so that I appreciate it and am responsible for it until I’m done with it, and then try to figure out the best thing to do with it. And you can apply that thinking to your work also. And then that opens up possibilities around connecting things in a circular way. RM: Something you had touched on in December was that historically our approach to these systems, across scales, has been to share and have accountability, which is really to have circularity. We have moved away from these patterns and now we’re kind of stepping back to them. Are we reinventing the wheel? JM: Having the fortune to have visited parts of the world that aspire to be more, American if you will, and trying to understand really what that means, it became clear that this culture of consumption and convenience for whatever reason is seen as desirable. For example, meeting people who come to America and they’re so excited about being able to buy tons of disposable plates and cups and cutlery because they just don’t want to wash dishes anymore, and how easy that is and how there’s no “reason” really not to, especially if you can afford it. One of the things I did when I was at Whole Foods was ask how we move away from disposables, because that’s not circular. The discussions about bringing real cutlery into the cafes were protracted and unsuccessful in the end. It’s really this culture of entitlement. You want a salad. I’m going to give you a fork, too. For free. There was an effort to try to either get rid of [the forks] all together or have reusable ones. It was too difficult to have reusable ones because of the cost and the loss and the washing and the labor and it just didn’t work out, and it wasn’t even seen as an option to not give someone the utensil. I think there’s a simplicity in places that haven’t migrated to a disposable consumer culture, simplicity in the sense of less things. Life’s maybe not less complex, and that’s maybe a challenge in the way we define it as “more” work to wash your silverware, but I only have to buy it once and I don’t have to lug it home and take the trash out all the time. People are somehow comfortable with certain behaviors and not others. Maybe if we did some sort of mass balance or work study, is it really less effort in the end? Is it really easier to use disposable? RM: I would say not. But it seems like there is work to be done to have the majority come around. Perhaps as a call to action, what do you think the future definition of these systems will be? What is the big takeaway next chapter for both the work of DEP and our city at large as we continue to think and work in this space? JM: I guess this is supposed to be the high note end of our conversation, but I feel we have a long way to go. I think we’re going to be able to do more things with circularity here in NYC because we’re lucky enough to be in a place where setting up those types of systems would make sense. For example, back to the biosolids; we have so many nutrients centralized here already, because of our population. If it would make economic sense for anyone to become an urban nitrogen or phosphorus mine, it would be us. If we start to think about those things, and pick a few to act on, I think we could be on to something. There was a professor at Rutgers, Kevin Lyons, he did this great study of mapping industry in Newark, and found out that there was a T-shirt manufacturer and a fabric supplier, but they weren’t connected so the T-shirt company was buying fabric direct from China. We don’t even know what’s going on around us. There are simpler steps just connecting to advance some of these concepts. Unfortunately I think we’re really far way away from where we need to be and sometimes I get disillusioned because people talk so positively and grandly but it’s not real, and I prefer to talk maybe a little more softly about conceptual things and a little more loudly about things that are actually working and happening. I’d be really interested if the reduced fare Metrocards got people out of their cars. I’d be really interested in hearing some stats on the plastic bag ban. I’d be really interested to see if the City’s commitment to electric vehicles pans out and how many gallons of fuel we’ve saved by making that switch ..starting to really highlight things that are working, rather than talking at very high levels about somewhat abstract concepts like circularity. I don’t know if that’s really inspirational, but I’m impressed with the number of people who are working in this space, and that’s why I always agree to participate in conversations because I don’t think there can be too much connection, and some of the things are going to turn into new things, and projects will happen and successes will be had and ideas will grow and flourish. I also am a big believer in diversity in the sense of cross-pollinating what we’re doing. I was so glad you invited me to join your group because I guess I’m a non “traditional” type participant. That’s what needs to happen, conversations across types of participants. Another Whole Foods example, we were focused on change around the end of the supply chain with resources that came into the store. I’ll pick on the fish people, we would say “Hey fish people, stop sending us fish in Styrofoam boxes”. Fish people said “well what do you want us to send it in?” We would say “something that is not Styrofoam and is recyclable”, and they said “okay but we don’t know anything else that will keep your fish cold and fresh without falling apart and costing lots of money.” So then we kind of looked at each other and realized, oh to really solve this problem we have to talk to the Styrofoam box maker, and we have to talk to the health code people about proper temperature holding time, etc,etc. So it becomes an exercise of bringing all the people together who have to solve a problem. On a positive note, the company did have a reusable tote program for a portion of the seafood supply chain that they had vertically integrated. Another great story is how New York City joined with Chicago to shift from plastic to compostable cutlery in schools. With the two significant quantities of purchasing power they were able to get a manufacturer to commit to production. Sometimes you really have to do these things at scale. That is the way we tend to operate as a society. I think small scale stuff is totally awesome and it needs to happen. If you can, compost in your backyard – by far preferable to trucking it somewhere. But not everybody can do that. And we’re in a dense urban system so we’re a place where bigger things can happen. RM: So it sounds like we have a long way to go but there are some tangible next steps that we could all take; sharing being paramount. JM: And thinking about resources, taking ownership of your resources, and responsibility for them. Also having more transparency or general knowledge about what those resources truly are, and/or what their path to life has been; where they come from and what will actually happen to them after they leave you. RM: Great. Well, thank you. Is there anything that you hoped I’d asked you we didn’t cover? JM: I don’t think so, but I do want to give a shout out to design, because it solves many challenges when done well, and its potential shouldn’t be overlooked. That’s what I’m excited about in the future; tapping into the creativity that’s out there, and using design to help people who have ideas about circular projects make them happen. This interview was originally conducted in the first weeks of March, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before publication, we caught up with Jennifer to see if she had anything to add in light of shifted context and amidst the pandemic. Here is what she had to say: JM: The impacts of the 2020 pandemic on resource recovery efforts will be lasting. The most immediate impact is a constriction of municipal funding for projects as cost savings measures direct limited resources to core services. In my opinion, the need for innovative financing mechanisms and the ability for public resources to have their value realized is more important. This poses new challenges for bureaucracy, traditional utility service models, and the skill sets required in a more complex and interconnected working environment. Perfect conditions for innovation and industry disruption. It is going to be an exciting few years as we look to recover – and, as some have said, build it back better!

12,Turning the Heat: An Interview with Will Sibia,https://urbandesignforum.org/turning-the-heat-an-interview-with-will-sibia/,"December 3, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2019 Forefront Fellowship, Turning the Heat, addressed ways urban practitioners can advance climate justice principles across New York City. In partnership with the Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, Fellows surveyed neighborhoods, studied buildings, interviewed local and international stakeholders, and produced creative research on mitigating heat. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on creating circular economic and sustainable models in NYC, developing community resiliency within NYCHA housing, factoring design into preventative care, and establishing a climate first approach to housing which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Will Sibia, founder of Urban System and Co-Founder of Urban Tech Sweden, accompanies Circular Systems. Read the full set of Turning the Heat proposals and interviews here. Michael Izzo: Can you describe what circular systems are? How have the Nordic countries adopted this approach? Is it a political or societal movement, or did some other factor lead to thinking in this way? Will Sibia: The first time I was exposed to this kind of thinking was in the context of creating infrastructure that is very democratic, meaning that any infrastructure should be created for the majority of the population to be used. I did my masters program at Royal Institute in Stockholm, where I got in touch with the development of the Hammarby Sjöstad Lake District in Stockholm and learned about how they started to think about converging waste, water and energy. One of the most striking things was that since it was socialistic system and society, equality was ingrained. Instead of making infrastructure that looked good or would allow a certain section of population to use the maximum amount of infrastructure, which is seen a lot, they started investing in infrastructure that will be used by the maximum number of people. When you do that, you allow the majority of the population to use the maximum of all infrastructure you create, so the bottom pyramid of a society has access to the best facilities and when the bottom of the pyramid lifts up, the whole society lifts up. When they wanted to take this approach further, they wanted it to be fossil fuel free, because creating infrastructure that is based on fossil fuel is not addressing the problem for the majority of citizens. This is how the term circular systems or circular infrastructure came about, around 15 years ago. Before that, the approach was integrated infrastructure. Now, since circular infrastructure is also creating economic progression without adding more resources to the economy, or without consuming more resources, it’s being also termed a circular economy. What it means is essentially creating infrastructure that is adding to and driving the downstream economy without consuming more resources to generate economic prosperity for everyone. Credit: Hans Kylberg MI: What are the key elements to embarking on a more circular approach? Does it happen at the design phase? Do we need capital pressure, legislative pressure? WS: When it comes to infrastructure, unfortunately, regulatory requirements or political will is the key. Of course, it’s sort of a chicken and egg story. Political pressure will come if the market or the people are informed enough to drive the politicians to meet that goal. But in the end, creating a new type of infrastructure will require massive political will and support from the regulatory side rather than the market. We’re seeing some of the market drivers that can influence that. But it is still driven mostly by the public sector segments in the society. MI: Currently, we have the capital pressure, the legislative pressure, and it seems like we have this societal pressure. What do you think the missing link is in order to truly enact change in the timeframes we are targeting, whether it’s 2030, 2040 or 2050? WS: I believe that the two fundamental barriers are how we finance and how we procure. We have been using the same financial products and procurement methodologies for decades. The financial products do not take into consideration the procurement of the technology and the knowledge at the project level. This gap needs to end. The people investing in the projects should be aligned with the people who are procuring the project. They cannot say, “We will pass the risk on and whatever you do, it’s up to you.” One of the biggest problems with infrastructure is also the early stage investment in infrastructure. That’s the most costly part of developing infrastructure. And that is because no one wants to spend enough money to create the feasibility of the techno-economic analysis. They only do enough so the capital markets can release the money and then the work starts. Whereas if you take away the intermediaries in the process, and the decision is to be made on the final outcome, and the capital markets’ decisions are based on this outcome, you will promote a more equitable infrastructure. Instead of having an economic outcome, then the outcome would be the positive effects on the climate, positive effects return on climate equity, return on reduction in carbon, return on reduction in air pollution. These things need to move up when you design the financial product. MI: In the Nordic countries, have you seen a lot of other co-benefits that can resonate with the population itself? What has the communication or messaging been? WS: There’s massive pressure from the public. The private sector, the occupants, and citizens are pushing the government and organizations to do more. There’s a lot of communication, and sometimes over-communication that ends up greenwashing rather than creating action. That’s the other side: everyone starts over-communicating because that’s the right thing to do, rather than actually taking measures. But communication has not been a problem in this part of the world. MI: Are circular systems held back by incumbents, such as energy providers? Are they barriers or they have adopted this strategy as well? WS: In reality, the energy utility companies will lose by adding more renewable energy in the system. The total infrastructure has not been made for decentralized energy production; it’s made for large scale energy production and distribution. It’s a very linear system. That’s why the uptake of renewable energy is not as significant as it should be. From the communications point of view, the existing utility companies are highlighting and marketing every little advancement and investment in renewable energy, but in reality, they’re not as proactive as their marketing would indicate. MI: In circular design, where’s the innovation coming from? What are the best examples that you’ve seen lately on the leading edge of this? WS: We have seen very good, small scale districts getting made in Holland and in Denmark. Even in the UK, they are making a small community that is consuming what is being produced on site. If you go back 200 years ago, that’s how we are supposed to live. Everyone was circular. Just take the oil out, take the external energy source out, you will have to be circular. The Nordic countries took that to heart. They made a decision and put into law that we don’t have oil, so our systems should not use an energy source that we don’t have. MI: How do you think places like New York City, which are very financially outcome driven, turn to a more circular approach? We have old infrastructure that keeps getting repaired over time. How do you get over the financial hurdle in order to replace the infrastructure to something that’s more equitable? WS: In a way, New York has all the right ingredients to be able to transform itself because it’s a service economy. In a service economy, the key ingredient is human resource. And that resource New York is already sitting on. If you combine innovation, human resources for less, and a common vision, the transformation can be done very easily. And once you start moving towards transformation, so many more people can operate in such a small footprint and produce such a large transactional volume in terms of the infrastructure required. Imagine if you started consuming with the same mindset and using the transportation system with the same mindset, then you have a super sustainable mega city. MI: What do you see as the next chapter in sustainability and circular systems? WS: It’s very hard to comment on where it is headed. But the majority of technological innovations in recent times have allowed the bottlenecks between consumption and production to be eliminated. Uber has allowed people to use cars more. Amazon has allowed people to consume more. Apple, Samsung, and these companies have allowed people to start relying on more gadgets, food, transportation services the same with the content. We’re living in a world where the consumption has increased manyfold. I think we need to come to the realization that we have to accept the biophysical limits of the boundary at the country level, city level, planet level — whichever level — and limit ourselves to that and create systems to allow that. For example, you can have dynamic pricing. The more you consume, the more expensive it will be. You can have the bottom of the pyramid have the best of the infrastructure at the least cost, but in dynamic pricing, the more you use, the more you have to pay. MI: I know Sweden had a carbon tax back in the 90s, which really didn’t work. Is there an example of what worked in lieu of a carbon tax, whether it’s supply and demand pricing or dynamic pricing or something else? WS: Yes, there’s actually a very good example. The road tax in Stockholm is dynamic during the peak hours or predicted peak hours, and if more cars are coming you have to pay more. During the vacation periods when people don’t want to go to the city, the tax reduces. Instead of just jamming the road, maximizing the stress on the infrastructure, and creating the loss of time from many people, either you don’t go into peak hours or you take public transportation only and not use the car. This could be done in public transportation as well, during the peak hours versus in the day when it’s empty. Why do people have to pay the same amount during the peak hours? This model has been evaluated for many cities and how they create the infrastructure. MI: That makes all the sense. Basically, limit the amount of use of the physical infrastructure we have today. It has its limitations. We just keep trying to push it more and more as time goes on. WS: Think of the building infrastructure. Even the physical infrastructure, we’re making for the peaks. MI: It comes back to the utilization rate that we’ve talked a lot about. Offices are occupied during the day and not at night and residents are the opposite. Utilization of your vehicle is something like 2%. We have a lot of infrastructure that hardly gets used. WS: Exactly. Imagine you start creating an equity for that and creating a business model that has a cost for that. Imagine taxes. You only pay tax on how much you use. So if you use more, you pay more. I mean, imagine schools and university that sit empty for half the year. Such big buildings, so much infrastructure sitting there. MI: Given your experience in the New York market more recently, what lessons learned or advice would you provide to others struggling within a very linear economy with many incumbents who believe infrastructure change would be too difficult and too many obstacles? WS: For most people change is always difficult. No one likes change. But persistence, perseverance, and patience is the key. You can’t be impatient. You can’t say that this is too hard if you want to do it, and for the people who are not convinced it’s just a matter of time.

Nadina Galle: I’m doing a PhD in ecological engineering jointly at University College Dublin’s Dynamics Lab, the MIT Senseable City Lab, and Trinity College Dublin. I am the co-founder and CEO of a geo-AI firm, which is specialized in urban ecological engineering, called Green City Watch. I’ve also been developing a number of concepts, one of which I’m most proud is called the Internet of Nature, and how we can use technology to better enhance and improve urban nature. I previously worked at the Metabolic Institute for three and a half years, working mainly as an urban and industrial ecologist helping cities, regions, buildings, festivals, hotels and large organizations, to transition to a more circular state. LA: We’ve seen the concept of circular economy and urbanism take off in different ways in different places. I’m curious how you in your own words would define what a circular city is. NG: I like sticking as close to the definition of a circular economy as possible, and then simply applying that to the urban context. For me, a circular economy is one that is regenerative and waste free by design. In the same tune, a circular city would be one that is regenerative at least by design. I think the best way to break that down a little bit more is how the Metabolic Institute has defined this framework called the Seven Pillars of the Circular Economy. These seven pillars speak to just how holistic a circular city should be. When we read about circular cities, we may read about recycling or more broadly about material flows. That’s often how people view a circular economy — that it’s all about reducing waste. Nature knows no waste and therefore a circular city should know no waste. But it really goes a lot further than that. Of course materials should be able to be recycled at continuous high value, but a circular city should also mean that all energy is coming from renewable sources. It should mean that water is being extracted at a sustainable rate. It shouldn’t mean that things like biodiversity and society and culture are preserved. It should mean that the health and well-being of humans is supported, and it should mean that human activities are generating more value than just the financial symbols. A circular city includes looking at things like aesthetic value and other things that give humans a lot of joy and adds value to their lives without necessarily having a monetary stamp on it. It’s important to frame circular economy in that holistic sense. Metabolic is really a leader in systems thinking, going further than this reductionist thinking so that instead, it’s all about looking at these different factors within a holistic framework. One of my favorite analogies to use is the analogy of a Rubik’s cube. If you wanted to, for example, make sure that all your energy was renewable, you might look to install solar panels on your roof. If you look at a Rubik’s cube, think about that problem as one square on that Rubik’s Cube. If you had to get that one square on the Rubik’s cube to the other side of the cube, you will have to move so many other different colored squares before that one square is in the right place. What you’ve really done is created all these other unintended consequences, or as we like to say, you’ve shifted the burden. You might have installed solar panels on your roof, but have you taken away the function of that roof for something else like a green roof? Or have you installed solar panels that might not actually be recyclable at the end of their lifespan? Or maybe you installed solar panels that include toxic materials which came from a mine in China where you could not protect the health and the rights of those workers. I know that it quickly becomes really complex and really scary but I think until we embrace that complexity, we won’t really have circular cities that work and function in the long run. LA: As a fellow systems thinker, that feels intuitive to me. But I’ve noticed that, among different actors within these complex and dynamic urban systems, that can feel overwhelming, like you said. Given all that complexity and the different levers that have all these ripple effects across a city, where would you start or make your first move? Courtesy Steve Jurvetson NG: The first move is always to understand where you are. There’s one more quote that I think really helps to ease the complexity of all that systems thinking. Pete Seeger said, “If it can’t be reduced, reused, repaired, rebuilt, refurbished, refinished, resold, recycled, or composted, then it should be restricted, redesigned or removed from production.” I really like that because immediately you can take one thing, whether it’s a product or process, and you can apply that quote and then see where you land. In that same tune, when it comes to developing a circular city or circular urbanism of any kind, you really can’t come up with interventions or a vision until you really understand where you are. The first method that you can apply to understanding where you are is something called an “urban metabolism.” It has actually been around for a really, really long time. Abel Wolman, an American sanitation engineer, first came up with it. He talked about how humans and processes within urban environments metabolize resources. A city will have inputs, there will be different processes that take place within that city, and then there will be outputs from that. LA: That’s helpful. I’m also thinking a bit about examples of success and where this movement has gone. Having experience in both the European and the North American context, what do you see as the cutting edge right now in Europe? Are there are any takeaways or strategies that could translate over here in the States? NG: The Netherlands, for one, is completely saturated with circular economy knowledge and consultancies and think tanks and government-funded research programs and cities applying circularity and having circularity visions and roadmaps and action from a theoretical perspective. But it is also saturated from a business perspective. I think the Netherlands has done a lot, whether that’s through subsidies or subsidized accelerators, or whether that’s through the culture. The government has been quite influential in getting the terminology and ideas of circularity into the hands of regular citizens. An uncle of mine who has absolutely nothing to do with this industry was mentioning how he had read about circularity in the papers and he knew all about circular economy. In North America, concepts like circularity or circular economy are still very much in the ivory tower. Although, I’m very wary of making generalizations between the Netherlands and the US because the Netherlands is tiny in comparison. Knowledge dissemination is a lot easier in a country that only has 17 million people. In terms of other really exciting European examples, there’s actually a ton happening in the east as well, in countries like the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, there’s a ton of really grassroots action happening from a metabolic standpoint. There’s been a ton of really entrepreneurial spirit there. The Scandinavian countries have historically had a lot of funding and subsidies available to not only research and get feasibility studies done, but also implement a lot of this work. I’m amazed at how circularity has spread just in the last five to six years across Europe In Europe, we see three main types of actors working on accelerating that transition. There are companies that have a circular business model. That could be a company that’s growing mushrooms oyster mushrooms on used coffee grounds, or a brewery that exclusively brews its beer from the hops of old bread. Companies like that have instigated a circular business model and act as these beacons of inspiration to other entrepreneurs. Then there are the nonprofits, which are disseminating knowledge and serve as information hubs. A great example of this is the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in the UK. The third group is the consultancies and think tanks working with clients directly. Sometimes it’s not made public because when it comes to doing material flow analysis, especially with a corporation, that’s actually some pretty sensitive information. All three of these groups also work together in different ways. LA: I think about the different types of strategies or solutions within circular cities: on the one hand you see a lot of high tech tools used to monitor flows and evaluate in real time, which lends itself to technological solutions, and then there are a lot of conceptually simple solutions like returning to nature and different urban forestry and green infrastructure strategies. I think it’s interesting how in your work now you’re marrying the two. Do you have any reflections on how either or both — the technological approach to utilizing this kind of data, as well as the relatively old school solution of planting and maintaining healthy urban forests — fits into these broader ideals of circular city urbanism? NG: In a lot of the circular economy talk, we’re mapping all of these different flows, but you have this baseline assumption that the city is a blank canvas. We often forget that there was an ecosystem and there is currently an ecosystem in cities. There are native species, there are different soil types, there’s a geography, there’s a geology, there are watersheds. I’d love to see more of is just more of an integration of urban metabolism scans and actual urban ecology into circular city literature and work. Technology is going to be quite critical in terms of prioritizing what we do in terms of which natural areas do need help, and so on. Whether we do that with remote sensing or opinion data mining based on people’s Tweets or their reviews on Google, technology plays a role. But we need to remember that there were ecosystems before there were cities, and if we really want to get back to this regenerative concept inspired by nature, this biophilic kind of civil design, that is critical to remember.

14,Neighborhoods Now Spotlight: Libreria Barco de Papel,https://urbandesignforum.org/neighborhoods-now-spotlight-libreria-barco-de-papel/,"October 8, 2020","Libreria Barco de Papel is a nonprofit bookstore and cultural center mere footsteps from the bustling Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens. Founded in 2003, it is now the last Spanish-language bookstore left in New York City and is a beloved cultural hub in the neighborhood. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Barco de Papel has faced an economic crisis and is currently raising support on GoFundMe. While more than 10,000 restaurants in New York City are participating in the city’s Open Restaurants program, there is not a similar program for other types of businesses. As part of Neighborhoods Now, the Jackson Heights working group created a proposal for the city’s Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement street seating for Libreria Barco de Papel. DOT informed them that the city is now exploring avenues for outdoor seating for non-restaurant businesses and to submit an application at a later date. At the time of publication, that application process is not yet in place. Launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Neighborhoods Now is a collaboration between the Urban Design Forum and Van Alen Institute to channel pro-bono resources from New York-based design firms into community-driven recovery. Emma Silverblatt of SO-IL, one of the participating designers in Neighborhoods Now, recently spoke to Paula Ortiz of Libreria Barco de Papel about the center’s history, role in the community, and challenges in the wake of the pandemic. Interview with Paula Ortiz ↓ Paula Ortiz. Photo: Accra Shepp Emma Silverblatt, SO-IL: I understand the bookstore began in 2003. Why did you choose to open it in Jackson Heights? What is your relationship to the area? Paula Ortiz, Libreria Barco del Papel: Ramon Caraballo is the founder of the bookstore. The only Spanish-language bookstore [in New York City] was in Manhattan, and many Spanish-speakers living in Queens didn’t have the time to go all the way there. He started by selling books in the street. From there, he got to know the needs of the neighborhood and thought about a children’s bookstore, because many parents were looking for books for their kids to reconnect with their culture and for the folktales that they read. There was a need for a program for kids to connect their parents’ roots, so we started doing La Hora del Cuento (Storytelling Hour). Each month, we highlighted stories, artists, festivities, and holidays that were relevant to the Hispanic community. It was all free — what we were doing was to promote the culture. We then started our program La Centro Cultural to connect our community to communities elsewhere. We started with open mics and readings, and then we began hearing from writers in Spain, Belgium, and Mexico, saying, “I have my book, I’m coming to New York, can I present it there?” Because we give opportunities to authors who are not well-known, they have a space to share their knowledge with others. If people can gather here, get to know your work, and access your book for a decent price, that’s what it’s about. This is our humble philosophy. Our community started seeing us not just as a business, but as a place where they’re able to connect with their culture, a place where they can meet, a place that people feel is part of their everyday. It’s not just the inventory — although we have an inventory that is unique in the city, because we are the only Spanish bookstore left. It’s the persistence and resilience of our community that makes us stay. Libreria Barco de Papel, Jackson Heights, Queens. Photo: Daniel Kuehn, ARO ES: How do you engage with the community here in Jackson Heights today? PO: Jackson Heights is the most diverse neighborhood in New York City. You can be in so many countries at the same time just by walking in one block — it’s magical to be here. [When you come to New York City as an immigrant,] you come here with one goal: to work and to help your families succeed in their country. That can create a sort of individualism, because you need to fight for your own survival. There can be a lack of communication as to how our communities can help each other. We come here to work, but we also bring our culture with us. We bring our food, our stories, our history. So Barco del Papel is a hub and venue for people to maintain their roots, to have a place where they can pass their traditions to others. If we have spaces that promote our culture, people will feel connected. That’s the value that any cultural center has. It’s a spot where you can learn about and connect to your past. This space is always welcoming for whoever wants to come. We evolve as the community has been evolving. We went from having children’s books to having adult and children’s books; from having only Spanish books, now to having Spanish and English books. The community is growing and parents want their kids to learn a second language. So we have been evolving into a store that is adapting to the needs of the community. ES: How can people support you through this time? Libreria Barco de Papel, Jackson Heights, Queens. Photo: Daniel Kuehn, ARO PO: Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and Corona were among the most hard-hit neighborhoods in New York City by COVID-19. We’re one block away from Elmhurst Hospital, and the pandemic has had a huge impact on our community. We lost a lot of people, a lot of close friends. We’re good at supporting each other, but it’s been a rough road. Before the pandemic, all this dust was under the carpet. What the pandemic did was to lift the carpet and expose our social differences — including economic differences, differences in food access, and the lack of access to resources for small, minority-owned businesses. As a small business, we tried to get an SBA loan but didn’t receive one. We encountered a lot of red tape, and many loans went to businesses with more employees. We’re not a big bookstore, so we have to deal with that. Instead, we started a GoFundMe campaign and have gotten a lot of support. People can donate books and we are looking for new inventory software. But the main needs of the store right now are our rent and utilities. Donations — it can be five or ten dollars — can help us a lot. We appreciate what Neighborhoods Now is doing for us so much. As immigrants, there are not a lot of people that are going to advocate for us. There’s a preconception and a presumption that immigrants have a lack of ownership or care for their communities. But there are a lot of immigrants doing good in our community, and they need to be supported. We need to make sure they’re getting help, advice, and ideas on how to navigate the pandemic. This interview was adapted from a conversation with Emma Silverblatt, and has been edited for clarity."
15,Care for Hudson Square: Winner Announcement,https://urbandesignforum.org/care-for-hudson-square-winner-announcement/,"September 15, 2020","Urban Design Forum is pleased to announce that WIP Collaborative is the winner of Care for Hudson Square, a recovery initiative in partnership with Hudson Square Properties and Hudson Square Business Improvement District. Over the summer, the Urban Design Forum joined forces with Hudson Square Properties and Hudson Square BID to launch Care for Hudson Square, a recovery initiative to reactivate the public realm with a site-specific installation. Urban Design Forum invited proposals to strategize using the streetscape as a site for cultural reawakening after months of social isolation. After a two-round design competition that invited small and M/WBE firms based in New York City, three teams–WIP Collaborative, Taller KEN, and Dash Marshall with Public Policy Lab–proposed vibrant and community-centered designs to reimagine a placemaking installation on one of three sites: King Street between Hudson and Greenwich Streets; Sixth Avenue (“Little Sixth Avenue”) between Spring and Broome Streets, and a Privately-Owned Public Space adjacent to 375 Hudson Street. The competition’s finalists and winner were selected by an interdisciplinary jury from the Urban Design Forum’s network of fellows and judged proposals based on physical presence, evolving public health guidance, and inclusive design. Care for Hudson Square–and the breadth of innovation, creativity, and community-centered approaches–serves as a call to action to replicate in other neighborhoods with new community partners in this evolving public health landscape. Explore the winning and runner-up proposals below: Winner ↓ WIP Collaborative WIP Collaborative’s Restorative Ground proposal for King Street in Hudson Square.

16,Cooperatives in Construction: An Interview with Rebecca Lurie,https://urbandesignforum.org/cooperatives-in-construction-an-interview-with-rebecca-lurie/,"September 10, 2020","This fall, the Urban Design Forum is launching Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery. In partnership with Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson and the Mayor’s Office of M/WBE, our Fellows will conduct research on how to create economic opportunity for MWBEs and employee-owned businesses through climate investment, leveraging the new market for building energy retrofits created by Local Law 97. Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Rebecca Lurie, Coordinator of the Community & Worker Ownership Project at the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies, we discuss building infrastructure for small cooperatives, opportunities to strengthen the cooperative movement in the construction industry, and how cooperatives pay it forward. Katherine Sacco: How did you get involved with working in cooperative models and equitable economic development? Rebecca Lurie: After college, I was offered a job by a cooperative that did delivery to food coops in the Northeast. They were expanding into a new warehouse, and when they put the job out for bid for a contractor, they required that whoever got the job hired and trained a woman or “minority.” So, I became a carpenter because a business that was cooperatively owned and run decided that when they spent their development dollars to renovate, they also wanted to have some efficacy for people of color or a woman. I became a carpenter for a very small company in upstate New York. A few years later, I applied to the union upstate and became an apprentice in the carpenters union. My first career was as a union carpenter, which I did for about ten more years. Then I started doing training and education for the union, writing grants, and paying attention to opportunity and access issues, like pre-apprenticeship programs and access to the trades. Around 2008, there was money available as part of the Recovery Act to do green jobs, energy efficiency, and sustainability, and I got involved in that work. For the past six or seven years, the city has put money towards coop development. I moved to the City University of New York at the School of Labor and Urban Studies, where I started a project called Community and Worker Ownership Project. We’re putting together a curriculum and trying to support the cooperative movement in any way we can at university level. This movement is about a just and economically equitable system that might take us more towards economic democracy, and away from a capitalism that is hierarchical and gives preference to the few at the top. Then, I said “yes” to some old friends who I did construction with in the ‘80s, and we started a coop called New Deal Home Improvement, which was targeted to the home improvement sector. It helped me understand this whole market of people who work outside of the union or contested non-union spaces of commercial construction and affordable housing. The home improvement market is just a sliver of the construction market, but a lot of people in their homes need things fixed. This movement is about a just and economically equitable system that might take us more towards economic democracy, and away from a capitalism that is hierarchical and gives preference to the few at the top. KS: What where some of the learnings you took away from New Deal Home Improvement? RL: New Deal Home Improvement has suffered in the home improvement market. We identified a number of problems for ourselves as a small company after three years, issues like a strong back office, marketing, business development. In that space, a lot of things end up under the table, not necessarily following all the regulations and codes for employment. We were trying following all the rules and regulations, but we were competing in a market where there were a lot of people who weren’t doing that. We’re in the process of closing down fully, but in the interim, we got funded by the Workers Lab for a project called City Roots Contractors Guild. The idea is that the problems we faced are probably very common to any small groups trying to be in this market. A robust organization always has a back office, but if you’re strapping on your tools and going with your van to do work, you might not have the ability at the end of the day to pay attention to all the billing, invoicing, paying attention to the regulations. Can we help solve these problems collectively? We hope to provide that. When I was working for New Deal and driving around, I saw this engine of tradespeople in the outer boroughs all the time, from eight to five. I tried to understand how those small businesses function. A lot of people rush home at the end of the day to do some paperwork. When I spoke to some of my business colleagues, I found that if they were able to afford someone back at the office— a secretary, receptionist, bookkeeper—and put that into their financial model, they were doing better. The jury is still out on what we are designing with City Roots Contractors Guild. But we are talking to businesses, seeing if they can afford us, and explaining to them that even though there’s a cost to those back-office services, we think that cost is much less than hiring a full-time person. KS: How does a racial justice framework shape the work that you are doing to support cooperative models? RL: With these small home improvement businesses, many of the workers and businesses who are in the shadows are people of color. I want to align the workers and businesses, because often these are people who do the work themselves, they’re worker-owners. They are trying to pursue their American dream, but achieving success is very hard, so they’re pushed into the black market. Everybody is happy to get to work, and in their circle, nobody cares about taxes or workers comp. That is an economic engine for people in that community, and it’s vital. But this model concerns me. We’ve learned that sometimes when you rush work, you might sacrifice safety or quality, or people might not have the right skills. We’re hearing a lot of people say they want training for themselves and their workers, that they’re hired to do a good job but they don’t know how to do a good job, and may be learning it on YouTube at night. How do we strengthen this sliver of the market, and build a model in which everybody can work in their own neighborhood to make their community stronger? My vision for this market to be vital in every community. KS: What are particular challenges or opportunities you would expect with building cooperatives in the part of the construction industry that Local Law 97 targets, which is energy efficiency retrofits for the city’s largest buildings? RL: I don’t see the coops as they are currently sized as a solution here. But looking at businesses that are privately owned and looking at owners that are aging out, there’s a movement within the economic democracy movement to help businesses convert to cooperative ownership. How do we strengthen this sliver of the market, and build a model in which everybody can work in their own neighborhood to make their community stronger? The old world of community wealth building was a union job with good pay, pension, annuity, health insurance, training. Another paradigm of wealth building is ownership and control. With some companies, for instance, if the owner is ready to retire, could they consider selling to the workers rather than the next biggest company? Right now, there’s no relationship between the commercial market and the home improvement market, except that when people who work in the commercial market hit unemployment, they turn to the home improvement market. There’s a relationship from the more developed market down to the repair and maintenance of homes, but not the other way around. For people who are stuck in the home improvement market, who can’t find robust employment and are not able to move out into the other market, maybe something could be done to build that relationship, with intentionality. KS: Are there particular barriers to meeting the occupational training requirements for worker cooperatives or particular strategies that you’ve identified to strengthen training? RL: Cooperatives are small right now. Training happens in big spaces, with union-affiliated companies; with large companies who can afford to pull people out for a day here or there for their training; or at universities where people might pay for their training. If you don’t have enough nickels to rub together, you’re learning on the job. Without training, you learn from your mistakes, which means you’re making mistakes and they cost you money. CUNY’s Community and Worker Ownership Project brings together collaborators from around the world working in cooperative ownership. Image credit: CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. How do you get the smaller companies trained? The unions are doing all this training just for their members. How do you think about membership more broadly? There’s not an easy way to figure out the training. We’re looking at it now because through City Roots Contractors Guild, we want to make that available to some of the smaller companies, and it’s part of what they’re asking for. But we’re having trouble finding the right lab in New York City. Having worked with apprenticeship, I know that certified apprenticeship means two things: it means you get classroom training, like in a shop, and you get on-the-job training that’s guaranteed by the employer. It’s a great model, but it’s hard to figure out how to put that into a small company because it requires an investment of dollars, too. KS: What role do unions play in a vision for a future with flourishing cooperative ownership? RL: I’m very active in the Union-Coop Council of the US Federation of Worker Coops, which has people from all over the country who are unionists involved in coops. There’s a natural alignment, but people don’t always see it. They see it as either/or. The either/or model is because we come out of a union movement that was very tied to an employer at the bargaining table to fight for rights, not a labor movement to own the means of production. If unionists can see that we might be able to shift to owning and controlling the work, it would be a very different model.

17,Centering Energy Equity: An Interview with Daphany Rose Sanchez,https://urbandesignforum.org/centering-energy-equity-an-interview-with-daphany-rose-sanchez/,"September 10, 2020","This fall, the Urban Design Forum is launching Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery. In partnership with Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson and the Mayor’s Office of M/WBE, our Fellows will conduct research on how to create economic opportunity for MWBEs and employee-owned businesses through climate investment, leveraging the new market for building energy retrofits created by Local Law 97. Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Daphany Rose Sanchez, Executive Director of Kinetic Communities Consulting, we discuss building a small business in the energy efficiency sector, supporting MWBEs as part of a just transition, and achieving energy equity. Katherine Sacco: How did you get involved in energy equity work? Daphany Rose Sanchez: It was honestly completely accidental. I’ve been working in the New York space for 12 years now. I started working with Councilmember Julissa Ferraras on supporting community constituents that had environmental housing issues, and that led me to studying construction management and civil engineering in undergrad. I’m a proud native New Yorker, and I’m a third generation NYCHA resident. Growing up in public housing, there’s a mentality that you are less than everyone else because you live in public housing and it’s decrepit. But you don’t really understand the context of why it is decrepit. It wasn’t until undergrad that I started learning about disinvestment and everything the government has done to create this context, from using eminent domain to take away Black people’s homes to building this public housing and then not investing in operation and maintenance or capital improvements. It was infuriating to learn that at such an older age. I started saying to my family, “Listen, we’re really being fed a narrative from before we were born, and it’s not okay. And it’s a very racist narrative that’s created intentionally to keep our communities down.” My parents were aggressively trying to fight that narrative. In 2011 they purchased a home. They were the first ones in our family to buy a home, and everyone was so excited because it was a huge achievement. In October 2012, we were in the house, and I was working on my final thesis paper for undergrad, and water just started pouring in from everywhere. It was Hurricane Sandy. My windows broke, my floors broke. We waited and waited on the roof for hours, and we got rescued by boat. We were fortunate enough that we get rescued because our house was completely submerged after we were rescued. It took about two weeks for us to go back to the house because they weren’t allowing anyone into the neighborhood. And when we went back, I was in shock. I remember thinking, I don’t know what to do. I’ve learned about my history: being a public housing resident, being Puerto Rican in New York City, my black ancestors. My choice could be to give up and say, “This isn’t worth it, because the system is already designed for me and my family to not move forward.” What’s the point of fighting a 400-year-old system? It took me about a month to get myself up, with my family and friends’ help. I went back to school, and my civil engineering professors offered to come do some structural analysis for my family and the people in my neighborhood. I started working at Make the Road, because they were providing social services to people in the neighborhood but they didn’t have a technical person on their team who knew about structural analysis and engineering. I got the folks from my university to work with Make the Road and Occupy Staten Island to help people. I was literally translating in Spanish: “They are saying your frames are damaged.” It was not that hard to translate technical language from English to Spanish. But there was another type of translation: actually translating the technical terminology into something very basic. I continued working in translating resiliency and efficiency to common-sense English and also worked on sustainability program design and implementation that supports rather than displaces Black and brown communities. As I’ve continued diving deeper and deeper into this work at DEP, at Solar One, and then at a firm called ICF, my teams started becoming more and more white, and fewer and fewer New Yorkers. I have nothing against non-New Yorkers, but if we’re doing work in New York, let’s make sure New Yorkers are involved. I didn’t want to own a business, but I realized that the only way to really make change was by starting my own MWBE. I told ICF, where I was working at the time, “I’m going to start this MWBE. If you’re interested, I’ll be your partner. If not, you’re going to have to figure out how to tell folks that I’m no longer working here.” It was very scary. Thankfully, they were supportive. I actually opened my company a year before I told them, so that I could get all of my documentation in order. When I told them, they said, “Well, you have to do your MWBE certification.” I was like, “Done.” Do you have an EIN number? Done. Do you have your corporation documents? Done. I was like, “Any other questions? Because I’m ready for them.” So, in 2017 Kinetic Communities was launched, and then I left ICF in 2018. Within two months, we had our first government contract with the Retrofit Accelerator. That was the long journey of how that all started. KS: That is quite the journey! Your point about making sure that people who have firsthand experience with the effects of climate change are at the table when decisions are being made about how the city responds is so crucial. DRS: It’s absolutely essential. I can’t go to someone who has experienced a forest fire and be like, “Well, will this help?” I don’t know, I’ve never experienced it. But I can tell you for damn sure what to do to avoid a flood. KS: What kind of work have you been doing over the past couple of years with Kinetic Communities? DRS: We’ve really focused on projects that are centered on energy efficiency and energy equity. I’m not interested in just doing energy efficiency projects for the sake of climate change. Climate change is real for me, and we need to stop talking about it as something in the future because it’s happening today. I also believe that we’re going to achieve fossil-free net zero by 2050. But I also know — and this is my concern — that we’re going to do it on the backs of Black and brown communities. We’ve seen transitions like this happen throughout history, and we do it successfully, but our communities are always the ones that have to carry that burden. The projects that I’ve worked on are focused on elevating our communities. The first project I worked on was the Retrofit Accelerator, which supported affordable housing to integrate energy efficiency without sacrificing affordability. We’ve seen approximately 48,000 units of affordable housing do energy efficiency projects over the course of that project. I’m very proud of the project because we’ve been able to work very closely with HPD to acquire financing. “I also believe that we’re going to achieve fossil-free net zero by 2050. But I also know — and this is my concern — that we’re going to do it on the backs of Black and brown communities.” We are also working with NYCHA to support community solar. In the solar industry, there are very few minority-certified contractors and there are very few folks that have been transitioned from their regular electrical or roofing work into solar. We put together a 100% MWBE team to design, finance, and educate NYCHA residents on community solar. It was extremely hard, but we did it. We wanted to do community solar for the benefits of low-income subscribers and the benefits of jobs, but we also want to give NYCHA residents an opportunity to see someone else in their communities, saying, “Here I am in the flesh. This is a job opportunity that you can do.” I’m not some random white guy from California saying, “I’m going to put solar in,” and then disappearing. We wanted it to be a very inclusive process. Another project I’m very excited about is Electrify SI. We are finding mechanisms for Staten Island homeowners and renters to purchase air source heat pump technology utilizing either HPD financing or emergency repair grants. We are also working to elevate minority and women contractors who are doing general construction work in residential space, home improvement work, plumbing work, and HVAC work. We’re aiming to support MWBE contractors that are not certified for energy efficiency work to become certified. In the energy efficiency space, you have to be certified to utilize the incentives that are out there. A lot of times that certification process is very lengthy and exhausting, and then there is a huge insurance requirement, too. We have someone on our team that’s going to advise contractors: helping them acquire the documentation, helping them submit the documentation, connecting them to resources at SBS where they’ll be learning about accounting 101 and business operations. We also have a manufacturer partner who is going to be training them about air source heat pumps. Then, in 10 years, when the city says, “No more fossil fuel, no more furnaces, no more boilers,” these contractors won’t have to close shop or rush to figure out a new technology, while these other larger firms have already been established. KS: That’s such an exciting array of work. It’s really powerful to hear you describe how you, as an MWBE, work to uplift and support other MWBEs. Why is it so important for New York to invest in MWBEs in this sector? DRS: I’m going to use the case of public housing as an example. Public housing was designed, and then there was disinvestment. When folks think about the disinvestment, they think about operation, but the other part of operation is who is doing that maintenance and operation. If there are no funds for that, and there isn’t anyone who is properly trained for maintenance and operation in those neighborhoods, it’s going to be a bust. In this transition to a fossil-free future, New York is receiving experts from all over the world who are providing their feedback on what new technologies need to be implemented, how many passive houses we need to get done, etc. This is great, but if the experts are not in-house — and by in-house, I mean in every city, and specifically MWBE contractors — you run the risk of having a failed market transition. It’s so essential for the City to support MWBEs by connecting them to available resources and opportunities. There are opportunities that people aren’t aware of because they’re not within those circles. And it’s not their fault. They’re busy trying to make money, and especially after COVID, they’re trying to survive. It’s not enough to then tell them, “You need to go look up this website and read through this 30-page document and decipher the document.” “It’s so essential for the City to support MWBEs by connecting them to available resources and opportunities.” There is a big opportunity for SBS to provide technical advisory services for contractors to understand the technology. The same way that they do Cost Estimating 101, they should be doing Solar 101, Air Source Heat Pumps 101, Building Envelope 101. I know the moment that contractors hear from other routes — not only SBS, but also Univision, El Diario, culturally and linguistically appropriate media sources — you will get an influx of folks who have experience, who you and I have never even met, and they’ve been doing it for 40+ years. That’s really going to help us to sustainably move forward. KS: In order to meet our fossil-free goals in a way that really is equitable, what are the big leaps that we need to we need to be making in New York City or state to achieve that? DRS: We should be looking at public power and community ownership models. In the big picture, the framework of climate action and climate solutions is really driven from a profit standpoint, which hurts our communities. There needs to be an opportunity to elevate MWBEs and local nonprofits. We need to provide them with the proper resources, the proper money, the proper time, and the proper expertise for them to collectively uplift their neighborhoods, rather than taking an approach where we’re looking for another business model. KS: Any final words of wisdom that you want to share? DRS: For folks in the energy sector, there needs to be an opportunity to not only hire folks but really create an inclusive environment to welcome diverse leadership. The market is driven by folks who are white males of a higher socioeconomic class. Understanding how that privilege projects itself onto your work and being careful of that will be one place to start. We also need to ensure that the people who build the table that people are sitting around are part of conversations about a just transition. Energy efficiency and clean energy will be very valuable to preserving housing, developing intergenerational wealth, building a healthier community. I wholeheartedly believe that this can be a solution that supports all of these other issues.

18,Decarbonizing Buildings: An Interview with Stephanie Carlisle,https://urbandesignforum.org/decarbonizing-buildings-an-interview-with-stephanie-carlisle/,"September 10, 2020","This fall, the Urban Design Forum is launching Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery. In partnership with Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson and the Mayor’s Office of M/WBE, our Fellows will conduct research on how to create economic opportunity for MWBEs and employee-owned businesses through climate investment, leveraging the new market for building energy retrofits created by Local Law 97. Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Stephanie Carlisle, Senior Researcher at the Carbon Leadership Forum and former Principal at KieranTimberlake, we discuss the role of embodied carbon in achieving climate goals, how to make high-performance buildings the standard for all projects, and how to showcase the importance of retrofits. Daniel McPhee: Often, as architects and developers, we aren’t necessarily concentrating our climate solutions on the specific neighborhoods that had been most heavily impacted by the climate crisis. What can be done through design, policy and other strategies to ensure that the benefits of reducing carbon emissions are not just limited to business districts and wealthy neighborhoods where there are clients that can afford it? Stephanie Carlisle: Climate work and equity work need to be part of a general standard of care. It’s not an add-on service. It shouldn’t be above and beyond. The economics of how architects and engineers get compensated for their work is not simple, but doing a high performance building that entails healthy materials and uses less carbon shouldn’t be a special thing for special clients. We don’t treat fire code, health, and safety that way. We don’t say, “I’d put sprinklers in this building if the client paid me to do it.” We have to keep ourselves accountable, and I believe that firms should be disclosing the performance of their buildings. Not everyone agrees with that. We also need economic incentives that will make this work possible and not put the burden entirely on the owners of projects. There are highly successful examples that we need to learn from and probably expand. Subsidies for solar installations worked really well before they were largely rescinded. Right now, there are so many projects in which designers are figuring out how to make net-zero buildings and how to dramatically decrease embodied carbon, but finding a way to get that on a project without any policy mechanisms at all is hugely frustrating. That is another way in which cities need to be involved. We really need to think about the role of code and regulation that would apply to all projects. When we are advocating for higher performance, that is also technical. Net Zero design is challenging, and it means that design teams will need to do more modeling and analysis to be sure that real performance meets our assumptions. There is a learning curve and a necessary retooling for many practices. Our industry needs to start supporting itself and expanding access to these skills across the entire design community: we need better data and rules of thumb; we need tools that are easy to use and not crazily complicated; we need more case study projects to learn from, so people can adopt strategies and feel confident in them. The first time you try a new thing on a project, it takes additional time and effort. But if we push for decarbonization across the whole industry, within a pretty short period of time, it just becomes the way that design works. DM: One of the challenges our Fellows will be researching in the fall is how to support the small businesses in this sector with the right tools and knowledge. SC: I have learned working on projects, and particularly retrofit projects, going into buildings and seeing where improvements can be made, that the people who run those buildings can do incredible things when they have the freedom to manage them in the way they want. Letting that innovation also happen within the workforce, from the ground up and not always coming from an engineering model, is very important. DM: Much of your work has focused on the importance of embodied carbon. What is the difference between embodied carbon and energy efficiency? SC: Broadly speaking, there are two ways of talking about the emissions caused by buildings. The first way of measuring emissions is operational carbon, which is all of the emissions associated with operating a building—heating, cooling, running all the building systems. Then there’s embodied carbon, which is the emissions associated with materials, construction processes, and everything that flows in and out of the building over the course of its entire life. That covers everything from the initial extraction and manufacturing of concrete and steel, all the way to what happens to the materials when the building is demolished. When we put operational and embodied carbon together, we have a total carbon picture. It looks at the building in its entirety and its relationship to the environment. DM: When you’re talking about the total carbon picture, what’s the proportion between embodied carbon and energy efficiency? SC: Building operations make up roughly 28% of global CO2 emissions—a staggering amount—and it’s really important that architects and engineers work on them. There are lots of ways that we can address operational carbon: increasing energy efficiency of buildings, widespread electrification, decarbonizing the grid. We have to do that work. Embodied carbon is an additional 10-30% of global emissions, depending on how you split up industrial sectors and manufacturing. These are emissions that in the past have always been there looming, but we just put them in this one large bucket called “industry”, and designers never took any responsibility. To be more specific, concrete steel, and aluminum alone are probably around 22% of all of the emissions in the US. When you start to add on other common structural materials, like insulation materials, glass, plastics, mechanical equipment, et cetera, that’s around 25% of global emissions. That’s a really high amount. Every existing climate model shows that if the design community only focuses on operational carbon, even if we turn all our buildings to net zero buildings, we can’t meet our global climate goals. We cannot stave off catastrophic climate change under any scenarios if we don’t address embodied carbon as well. In part, that’s because a lot of carbon enters the atmosphere before anyone ever occupies the building. That’s why we also call embodied carbon “upfront carbon.” These emissions occur precisely in these critical next ten years. DM: What are some of the key considerations for thinking about decarbonization with existing buildings and retrofit projects? SC: How we deal with existing buildings is certainly a huge issue for operational carbon, where we are thinking about energy efficiency and buildings. How do we retrofit these buildings and make them perform better? How can we make them be supportive of a cleaner grid? How can they be tools to propel us into a green economy rather than tethering us to outdated fossil gas infrastructure? “We cannot stave off catastrophic climate change under any scenarios if we don’t address embodied carbon as well.” We also need to completely rethink our approach to existing buildings for embodied carbon. The tools of carbon analysis tell us what we’ve always known: you create far more emissions when you build an enormous building from scratch rather than make use of an existing building. But the analysis being done now shows that it is no longer a binary. There is wonderful research looking at how much of the building should you keep, and what are the trade offs between energy efficiency and embodied carbon. It an area ripe for innovation and design intelligence. I hope that the design communities can value not only those super shiny, incredibly well-engineered Net Zero and Passive House buildings that we need to make. We also need case studies of the normal buildings, which are 90% of the architecture that actually makes up the city. We need to invest far more heavily in applying these techniques to public housing, to public schools and daycares, to simple industrial retrofits, to a whole arena of projects that many of us hardly venture into. DM: I think you’re absolutely right. We don’t even have the infrastructure to celebrate those simple but important projects. SC: This past spring, I was teaching a new course for architecture students at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design about embodied carbon, and we spent a whole week talking about retrofits and material reuse. Two students in my class were like, “That’s the kind of work I used to do before I went to architecture school, and no one here ever talks about it.” We rarely talk about how renovations are important or groundbreaking. I love doing that work, and I think that we should also value those projects. The way we talk about them, whether we celebrate them, and whether they win awards matters within design culture. And it certainly matters to the person who lives in that building, because eventually, valuing these projects affects policy. It affects whether or not they can get a subsidy or some technical assistance to retrofit their home, which they probably care more about than a fancy award or professional photography. DM: How do you think tools like Tally, which you developed to integrate Life Cycle Assessment into design work, could change the way that architects practice? SC: KieranTimberlake started asking questions about the larger environmental impacts of our projects more earnestly about seven or eight years ago. We scratched our heads and asked, “Why are we just talking about operational energy and not carbon? At the end of the day, we are concerned with environmental impacts, and energy is this odd abstraction. Do we want less green energy? No, we want fewer carbon emissions. Can we build a conversation about that? Why are we leaving this whole other aspect of our work – specifying materials – off the table? How do we actually measure environmental impacts?” A few of us who had studied LCA said, “This is the methodology used in other disciplines, let’s see if we can start applying it to our projects.” What we found, of course, was that using a tool that’s built to study a cell phone or a pair of blue jeans gets very difficult very quickly when you start trying to model an entire building. The methods existed, some of the data existed, but critically, if we were going to embrace whole building life cycle assessment, or embodied carbon calculations on real projects, we needed something that an architect or engineer could actually use. We needed a tool that fit within a design software—for us, that was Revit—and in a collaboration space with our consultants and with our clients. We spent about four years developing that tool, first just for ourselves as a proof of concept. Then we engaged several development partners to come into the project and dozens of firms provided feedback and helped us improve the software and commercialize Tally so we could make it available to a broader architecture community. We’ve been using it since then, for about seven years now. There are thousands of architects all over North America who use the tool, but also many students. Tally and other tools that provide Life Cycle Building analysis calculate embodied carbon during the design process. Image credit: KieranTimberlake. Because it is integrated into the design process, it allows us to have information about embodied impacts directly connected to our design optioning. We don’t have a separate consultant running a model at the end of a project. Our basic premise is that if designers can’t test an option and get real feedback that they can understand, then that strategy probably won’t make its way into the project. Now, there are a bunch of other new tools coming online. Over the last eight or nine years, a very large community of architecture, engineering, and construction firms have begun engaging in LCA work and looking at the challenge of drawing down embodied carbon. We’re now in this space where we can share models and strategies, and benchmark data. But it’s still quite early, and everyone’s sort of making it up and innovating as they go. Not only do we need this practice to be normalized across the profession, but we also just need to know what works from a climate perspective, what strategies can scale and be used to truly transform construction. DM: Even just a couple of months ago, it felt like there was tremendous momentum to tackle decarbonization broadly throughout the design and construction industries. But the pandemic upended many industries, including design and construction. Reflecting on the current moment, how do you think decarbonisation efforts are going to be impacted? SC: The last few months have really brought an acknowledgement that this current moment of the pandemic is indeed a crisis, but a lot of people and communities have been in crisis for a long time. There are many ways that the current economic crisis, public health crisis, and social justice crisis dovetail with the climate crisis. A lot of communities were already in crisis long before the pandemic. There is no returning to normal. We need to talk and reckon with that. The current pandemic also shows that we can radically transform how we structure the economy, which industries we choose to prop up, and which industries need support. The green stimulus helps us think about how we can specifically shape climate policy that is centered on equity and justice. I’ve always found that public health is one of the strongest allies in making sure that we have those conversations about equity. That’s been the case for a long time in the design community. While this moment is really daunting, I think it will probably force us to do some hard work.

19,Mobilizing for Climate Justice: An Interview with Daniel Aldana Cohen,https://urbandesignforum.org/mobilizing-for-climate-justice-an-interview-with-daniel-aldana-cohen/,"September 10, 2020","This fall, the Urban Design Forum is launching Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery. In partnership with Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson and the Mayor’s Office of M/WBE, our Fellows will conduct research on how to create economic opportunity for MWBEs and employee-owned businesses through climate investment, leveraging the new market for building energy retrofits created by Local Law 97. Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Daniel Aldana Cohen, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Director of the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative at the University of Pennsylvania, we discuss mapping neighborhood-level carbon footprints, building coalitions in the climate movement, and a Green New Deal for Public Housing. Katherine Sacco: I wanted to start off by asking about one of your research projects, Whole Community Climate Mapping, which looks at household carbon footprint and climate vulnerability indexes at a neighborhood level. What have you found? Daniel Aldana Cohen: The big idea of the Green New Deal is to create disproportionate investment in frontline communities to tackle climate problems and inequality at the same time. The Whole Community Climate Mapping project hopes to provide tools to make that easier by mapping how the built environment is associated with carbon emissions and localized vulnerability at the same time. For example, it’s easy enough to identify the urban heat islands, and across the country, leafy (or cooler) neighborhoods are disproportionately whiter neighborhoods. But then we can also look at where people are having trouble paying electricity bills, such as for air conditioning. In Philly, there are neighborhoods with few trees but people can pay their electricity bills because those neighborhoods have gentrified. There are other places, very often communities of color that have suffered all kinds of discrimination, that have very high heat and a very high proportion of the income going to electricity. Those places are very vulnerable to climate change, as mediated through their economic situation. These areas where households cannot afford safe, cool, indoor temperatures should obviously take priority for doing retrofits, providing new and better air conditioning, and maybe modifying, increasing subsidies to, programs like LIHEAP, to help low-income households cover cooling costs. We can think about tackling vulnerability to climate change and emissions at the same time by figuring out the neighborhoods where people are hurting the most. We can use data to respond to residents’ concerns, such as not able to keep the home at a safe temperature, then propose a solution that address both vulnerability and decarbonization all at once in the same place. KS: We’re in New York, so I have to ask about the Carboniferous map that you put together a few years ago. What did you aim to achieve with this map? How can tools like maps contribute to the conversation around inequitable impacts of climate change? The Carboniferous map shows household carbon emission across New York City neighborhoods. Image credit: University of California Press. DAC: The Carboniferous map shows the average household carbon emissions at the zip code level for New York City, as well as where the public housing is located. It’s based on data produced by my brilliant collaborator, Kevin Ummel, who is an environmental economist and data scientist. The map shows that there are two stories of climate and density in New York. The first story is of very affluent neighborhoods in Manhattan, and a bit in Brooklyn, with carbon footprints comparable to the richest suburbs, because the rich people there buy so much stuff, and fly so often. And the second story is of mostly multiracial, multi-class neighborhoods well-connected to transit, anchored with public housing with very low emissions. Some of that story is poverty, which is bad, but in middle-income communities, that’s where the density really shines as a low-carbon solution. This is actually what the future of sustainability looks like. One key thing I wanted to express on this map is to debunk the idea that density is a carbon-free lunch—that you can have fabulous levels of affluence and consumption, and as long as you live densely then there’s no carbon problem. That’s simply not true. KS: You helped to develop a Green New Deal for Public Housing. Why public housing? And why are you now expanding that lens to low-income housing in general? DAC: Public housing is energy inefficient and poorly maintained, due to a massive repair backlog. The conditions are outrageous. A Green New Deal for Public Housing means that you tackle the buildings’ already existing problems and at the same time, you decarbonize them. It has a spectrum of benefits for residents, who probably don’t care about the carbon footprint of their electricity, but would certainly notice that they live in a much more comfortable apartment that has comfortable air conditioning in the summer, heating in the winter, no more mold, and cutting-edge appliances. There’s another, subtler reason to start with public housing. Policymakers have more direct influence over a public amenity owned by the government. Instead of a subsidy or an incentive program for private firms, with the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, we can say very specifically that three-quarters of the work done over ten years must be done by residents or low-income workers in that area, that the work must tackle all these other toxic issues in the apartments as well as decarbonisation, that there will be greater resident oversight than there had been in previous renovation projects. Finally, through the scale of investment required for the Green New Deal for Public Housing, we’re going to create skills and capacities for small businesses and worker coops that can benefit the entire building sector. We can apply those ideas to the low-income housing sector, except that instead of doing it through public housing agencies, we would do it through the Weatherization Assistance Program. A lot of us are talking about a massive scale up and expansion of the Weatherization Assistance Program to ensure that people of color and working class people can got new careers in the green building industry that will last their whole lives; to favor worker cooperatives and small-scale businesses; and to provide climate, health, and economic benefits to families. KS: How do the tactics for climate policy change vary across the local and federal levels of government? What were some of the lessons you took away from the Climate Mobilization Act in New York? DAC: One lesson from the Climate Mobilization Act is that you need strong mobilization from below, particularly in the housing movement. New York Communities for Change in particular played a key role. City Councilor Costa Constantinides, who introduced the bill, said on the floor of City Council: We have to pass this bill with provisions to protect un-rent-regulated apartments. We have to pass this bill so that when mothers and their children go to sleep at night, they’re not afraid of rising seas or rising rents. That is a really remarkable thing to hear, and something you never would have imagined hearing three or four years earlier, connecting climate change to housing insecurity in the context of decarbonization. The biggest difference in terms of what you can do locally and federally is scale of funds. Cities and states can’t mobilize money like the federal government. The ingenuity of Local Law 97 is that the city doesn’t pay that much. What that law essentially does is compel businesses to finance their own decarbonization, which could save them money in the long run. Insofar as some Green New Deal provisions can be financed by companies and enforced through regulation, that is something the local sector can do. What the city and the state cannot do is massive investments in NYCHA. But they have options. One is to use limited funds to give a bit to everyone. Another is to start at the level of transformation that you want to achieve ultimately with federal funding. New York State could certainly afford to do a Green New Deal for Public Housing-style deep energy retrofit for one or more NYCHA complexes, just not all of them. But if it did, and it’s kind of happening with NYSERDA, that would show the federal government what could be done. In a year or two, the federal government could expand on early experiments. “One lesson from the Climate Mobilization Act is that you need strong mobilization from below.” The same is true for low-income housing retrofits. We could try to do everything with on-bill financing so it doesn’t cost the state that much money, but then the problem is that no one is getting the kind of subsidy that might be necessary to move quickly and with deep retrofits. So instead of giving everybody a little bit, we’re going to deliver serious public investment to target strategic neighborhoods that are really hurting. Then we’re going to make the case for federal money to come and work on the rest of the city or state. KS: In 2018, you wrote about the need to build climate coalitions that include grassroots as well as policymakers. How has the climate movement approached coalition-building in recent years? What are some of the biggest challenges that you’ve seen? DAC: Housing groups, labor groups, racial justice groups, and policy elites come at the climate conversation in an asymmetrical way. The grassroots movements are underresourced, hammered every day, and fighting for survival. Often elite environmentalists are frustrated that grassroots groups that are basically dealing with climate change every single day don’t always foreground the environmental dimension and are somewhat suspicious of environmentalists. The resource asymmetry means that the policy elites will have to put in a lot of the front-end work in terms of figuring out what the intersections are between environmental issues and everyday economic issues faced by the grassroots groups, and then put together the spaces, both physical and metaphorical, for building trust. That’s going to take time. I’ve worked with housing movements for years now, and it’s not like you have one meeting and then sign off. You have to provide support to those movements’ own struggles. The policy elites have to put in time to educate themselves and understand these links. Then they also have to put in time, and be patient, with coalition-building to build trust across that chasm. Until you’ve done it, you don’t know what the forms of intersecting policy are going be. When we were working on the Green New Deal for Public Housing, it was really interesting to me to hear from NYCHA residents that they feel that they keep getting the worst appliances, because the procurement rules mean NYCHA has to buy the cheapest thing. I wouldn’t have paid as much attention to appliances if I hadn’t talked to residents about their everyday concerns, and that ended up being productive for creating a more sophisticated policy. KS: How has the current pandemic impacted your work on climate policy? How do we approach the longer-term time horizon of climate change in the midst of a crisis that feels so urgent? DAC: You have to see where we’re going, and then work your way back to the present and figure out the immediate next steps. To me, the climate movement is not about, how do we just unplug from fossil fuel and plug into sun and wind? It’s actually about substantial reduction in overall energy use all across the built environment, from building materials, to energy use at home, etc. If you don’t do that holistically, you’re just transitioning from an oil-extraction economy to a renewable-energy mineral-extraction economy. That’s not acceptable and politically may not be feasible, because that would put so many new frontline communities into struggle. With the built environment, we must identify the big systems we’re trying to rebuild, then translate that into short-term immediate political campaigns that have clear coalition partners with folks on the ground. Our wonk friends would do the carbon footprint analysis. Then we could go to groups and say, “We need to build a ton of new energy in New York State, and people are going to get mad. We need new consultation processes, and we need to find a way to expedite the construction of renewable energy in a way that communities upstate and downstate feel good about.” Then we go to housing groups and say, “If we’re blocking these natural gas pipelines, National Grid is going to hike the price of natural gas. We have to find a way to make sure that you’re first in line for swapping out those gas furnaces for electric heat pumps.” That way, we are building a broad, urban-rural coalition around a sophisticated set of demands, with long-term goals and short-term steps that build political power, and prevent unnecessary opposition. The pandemic has to do with health, obviously, but when the health crisis becomes a little bit better, then it’s all about the economic crisis and the weather disasters. We need to find forms of decarbonization and resiliency-building that bring immediate economic benefit and safety to the communities that are hurting. That’s eminently doable.

Public Transit During Corona: Regaining the Trust of the Subway Traveler Posted on September 4, 2020 How Public Transit Will Survive the Coronavirus in Legacy Cities The Concept The days of overcrowded subway platforms and trains are over. In large global cities with legacy public transit systems, like London, Paris, and New York, a populace not feeling safe when using public transit poses an existential threat to the transit system and, ominously, to the city that relies on it. But these same cities have assets that will allow them to overcome this challenge, including a vibrant public realm at street level which can be leveraged to manage the flow of people into the subway system, allowing the subway to comply with social distancing standards. New, street-level pre-boarding areas could provide quality waiting environments, and more fully integrate public transit into the life of the city. During peak transit times, these new public places would also give an indication of wait times to those wanting to board the system before entering it, informed by several sources of data, so people can decide whether to wait or take another route, walk, bike, or use a car service. And, during off-peak hours, these “social condensers” would function as outdoor public living rooms, assets to local communities, providing room to safely congregate in open air environments as well as space not just for transit users, but also for the general public to sit, meet, eat and drink, and participate in performances and the life of the street. New canopy structures would provide protection from the elements. Early pilot projects could be constructed quickly and inexpensively to test the concept. When fully built-out, the vision for quality public space at grade, serving as valves for the below-grade subway system, would not only re-establish trust in the safe conditions of our transit systems, but transform how we use transit infrastructure and the associated public realm. The Need Restoring a level of confidence in the safety of the transit system is a categorical imperative. Public Transit is the major public infrastructure required for the day-to-day functioning of great cities. Districts that rely on a subway can not get back to business-as-usual until people feel safe taking public transit again. Transit makes these cities accessible, providing equitable service to all, which is why we need to make all stations accessible to all. In some cities, public transit is a last resort for people with no other options. In others, public transit is a choice, more convenient than a car. But in these great global cities with legacy systems, the city as we know it would not exist without public transit. There is just not enough room on the roads to move the additional millions of people every day. Today, in the midst of the pandemic, the subway is the weakest link in getting back to work and re-booting the economies of major cities. It is not difficult to imagine maintaining safe social distances from home to the subway. And at places of work and other destinations, protocols are being developed to maintain safe conditions and social distancing. Workplaces can be incentivized to help spread out peak transit usage. But while transit agencies nationwide and internationally are trying to manage safety and social distancing in various ways, those who have experienced severe overcrowding on platforms fear that mere suggestions of this sort would have a de minimis effect on transit crowding. The public needs to be able to rely on a fail-safe approach to public health, not just recommendations. While these initiatives are important, they are not likely to be enough to fully assure people that they won’t be stuck on a train or on a platform in an uncomfortably crowded situation. Bus ridership has rebounded significantly more quickly than subway ridership, because it is easier to exit a bus back onto the street if it feels unsafe – the relationship to the street is visible and direct. Since subway trains and waiting areas are typically not visible from the street, crowding needs to be actively managed and rendered impossible to occur. And crowding must be seen to be actively managed, to engender public confidence that it is safe to use the system again. Pre COVID-19 many stations experienced dangerously overcrowded conditions. Sam Hodgson, The New York Times Even before Covid-19, many stations and trains were already unsafe. The legacy public transit systems are the largest and most robust systems, global leaders in serving their cities, yet transit users were subject to dangerously overcrowded conditions, often having to wait on packed platforms, unheated in the winter and uncooled in the summer, while full trains passed. The expectation that public transit riders should endure uncomfortable and dangerous conditions on a regular basis reveals an inequity in access to the resources of our cities. We don’t want to return to normal; we need a better normal. Mass transit systems in legacy cities were planned and largely implemented in a previous era. With recent advances in the availability of big data and our ability to leverage it, the way we use public infrastructure is undergoing a transformation, from traffic apps to deliveries, and ride-hailing services to bike-share. Examples of leveraging the new efficiencies of logistics, made possible by the availability of information and the ability to use it to transform urban systems, abound. Today, with new sources of data available to manage passenger flow and provide options, with minimal public investment, there is a better way. Large dashboards at the street will make data on transit options accessible to all. The Solution How do we regain the trust of the subway traveler? To move large numbers of people, part of the solution is simply running trains often enough, with short enough headways to move the required volumes of people while managing the maximum number of people on each car to maintain safe social distances. To ensure that trains are not overcrowded, staff acting as spotters could provide real-time crowd data, and eventually with cameras and visual or audio notifications limit on-boarding, if the on-board conditions are not safe to take-on additional passengers. Some systems already provide information to the public on the relative available capacity of cars on a train. But we remember crowded platforms from pre-Coronavirus days, how crowded they could get when trains are delayed or full, and the sense of not having options having already committed to a specific route. As long as we continue with the current scenario that doesn’t manage the flow of passengers onto the platform, the public will continue to fear overcrowded platforms and avoid using the system. Diagram 1: Existing conditions – no valve to manage crowding. To address crowding on the platforms, the flow of pedestrians onto them must be managed. Can the fare array, typically on a mezzanine between the street and the platform level, or at the platform level itself, also serve as a valve to stop people from proceeding to the platform if there is not enough room on the platform? Unfortunately, there is simply not enough space within the station itself to manage crowds at safe distances. Crowding in the unpaid areas, before the fare arrays, could be even more dangerous than crowding on the platforms, as these areas are typically smaller, and would impede the safe exiting from the station. Diagram 2: Valve at mezzanine manages crowding on platform and train, but crowds station. There is a third option: provide an area at street level to wait, so as not to crowd the station or stairs. But where is there enough space for the millions of people to gather before entering the transit system in a timed and regulated manner to assure their safety? In these cities, sidewalks are already at capacity with pedestrians, but drive lanes and parking lanes are used by very few. Waiting pavilions could be located on the street itself, reducing the carriage-way by a lane or two. These new transit centers would act as public squares, contributing to a more pedestrian-oriented and safer street environment, while providing convenient connections to other options for getting to one’s destination, and transforming certain blocks into pedestrian prioritized streets with access for only public transit modes and other essential vehicles. Diagram 3: Proposed Condition – Valve at street manages crowding throughout the system. At station entrances, a monitor will assure that people enter in a timed manner when there is adequate space on the platform, much the way supermarkets have been controlling the flow of shoppers into their stores. http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/7_SECTION-PEDESTRIAN-SIMULATION.mp4 Pedestrian flow simulation of the three scenarios, at a station entrance. On-boarding passengers could be screened for health indicators, and personal protective equipment, including masks, could be distributed. Phase I of the plan could be readily implemented in a matter of days, with no more investment required than employing a person to manage the line at the top of the stairs, some moveable chairs and planters, and perhaps a tent or simple canopy structure to protect people from inclement weather. Phase 1 could be implemented quickly and inexpensively. A more robust implementation of the concept could also be constructed with somewhat more planning and investment. Data from satellites, cellphones, turnstiles, cameras and/or sensors could be aggregated and integrated, along with apps and screens at the stations to reserve a time to enter or select alternate transit modes. At-grade entrances could be combined with access to bus service, micro-transit options and ride-share services. The seating, planting and paving for the space could provide welcoming areas to enjoy while waiting and observing safe social distances with clear navigation through the space. These new places would provide a meaningful contribution to the public realm: lushly landscaped public space with places to sit, eat and drink, a place for performances and meetings, and a new way to fully participate in the life of the city. Phase 2 elements The site plan illustrates an approach for integrating the station entrance into the public realm. An aerial view: the investment in transit infrastructure provides value to the public realm and associated sites. The new valve at grade integrates the full range of transit options. Canopies, planting, fixed and movable furniture provide for a wide range of public activities, combined with timed entrances to transit. Interventions at the street provide a community asset for transit users and all others. Through all seasons, day and night, the new entrances will manage access to the subway below with accessibility upgrades and public transit data. http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/16_PLAN-PEDESTRIAN-SIMULATION-1.mp4 The valve allows pedestrians to enter the station when the capacity on the system is appropriate. The Cost We recognize that the financial conditions of public transit agencies are in dire straits, due to drastically reduced ridership. But investments that address the root causes of this crises will pay dividends in increased ridership. It is well-known how costly it is to work on subway stations. An additional advantage to implementing this program to increase ridership with at-grade modifications, rather than below-grade, is that it avoids all the challenges of working within an existing station environment and unknown, hidden conditions, which is a risk to project budgets and arguably the main source of cost overruns. Other than providing new elevators, necessary to meet the project goals of universal design and access, which transit systems are implementing in any case, all work is at street level and should not be any more expensive than regular construction. The Environment As public places, these new interventions offer the opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of public transit as we move towards more sustainable cities. With developing climate-change, livable urban centers, for which a functioning transit system is a pre-requisite, present the best alternative to sprawl with its associated inefficient infrastructure. Making public transit safer and more inviting will build ridership and benefit the environment. An associated aspect of high-performance transit systems is leveraging environmental conditions to achieve a healthy and comfortable customer experience. In addition to the fact that it is only at the street level where there is enough space to socially-distant gather before getting on a train while conveniently providing passengers with other travel options, locating the waiting areas in the open air allows for much improved air exchange. Passenger comfort can be addressed with smart strategies that leverage solar gain, shading devices, and wind awareness to optimally configure social space. Environmental analysis for outdoor thermal comfort will inform final design options. A pedestrian-level environment analysis can be undertaken to understand the likely solar and wind patterns and feed into an outdoor thermal comfort analysis measured by Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) which can be used to optimize the location and geometry of the design elements, such as the canopies and the benches. UTCI considers several parameters including wind speed, temperature, humidity, and direct solar radiation and provides a “feels like” temperature value that indicates heat stress felt by a human body outdoors. The purpose of this analysis would be to evaluate, on a typical summer day for example, what thermal comfort may look like at the site, and to quantify the benefits of adding shading in the form of the canopies and trees This analysis of public space comfort informs design options including canopy footprints, benches, and activity locations. Next Steps Fully integrating the subway system into the life of the street is a challenge that a transit agency can not address on its own. But great cities are already implementing public plazas in underused streets. Business Improvement Districts are looking for ways to attract people to their neighborhoods with places and activities. City Planning offices and design communities are advocating for a safer, more sustainable and more equitable public realm, recognizing that transit is the gateway to it. Making the street part of the transit system allows for an integrated approach to a high quality and safe experience for subway users. Let’s find a few promising sites and do some pilot programs to test what works to get our great cities moving again!

Walkways: Rediscovering a Mass Mode of Transportation Posted on September 4, 2020 Every resident of New York City, in all boroughs, needs safe walking routes to parks, grocery stores and other essential needs. Marginalized neighborhoods in the City have less access to open space and amenities than primarily wealthy neighborhoods. For years, urbanists, architects and community groups have been advocating for the prioritization of pedestrians in the design of streets and the public realm, although by in large motorized vehicles have remained the main protagonists. The discussion invariably centers around mobility, and ultimately vehicles remain our primarily means of transportation. In the last two months of social distancing and business closures in NYC we have experienced a different kind of street, a shift in its primary role, from moving vehicles to moving pedestrians. As vehicular traffic has diminished, and social distancing has increased the spatial needs of pedestrians, the disproportionate and inequitable amount of street space dedicated to vehicles has been exposed for all to see. Walking to places is our newly rediscovered mass mode of transportation, and streets are the routes we take. For many in the city, the extent of travel has contracted to the range of our longest walks taken around our homes. This moment is an opportunity to permanently reclaim more street space for pedestrians. Expanding the network of public spaces the city has to offer, safely linking parks and neighborhoods for pedestrians will improve the city’s health and its people’s health. It’s time we reassert walking as a serious and important mode of mobility that deserves smarter and more widespread planning. The concept of reclaiming streets for pedestrians has been slowly but steadily building. New York City has seen the pedestrianization of many streets including Broadway, lowered vehicular use streets like the now bus-only Fulton St in Downtown Brooklyn, and of course the widespread new networks of parklets and bike lanes. Marvel Architects has been active for decades in rethinking NYC streetscapes to prioritize pedestrians. Recently, Marvel has been working with Union Square Partnership developing a plan to fully transform the square into an expanded pedestrian friendly district. This will include the pedestrianization of roadways, road diets and pedestrian safety measures. We have developed goals and design principles that are applicable not only to areas with high-density or high-visitation rates, but equally in less busy neighborhoods. Every resident of New York City, in all boroughs, needs safe walking routes to parks, grocery stores and other essential needs. To reimagine “City Life After Coronavirus” we must identify and draw these routes for every neighborhood in the city. To develop a map, similar to the one used to identify subway and bus routes, but for safely walking through the city. It will also indicate potential future extensions and connections. The space of the street will play a key role as we transition to a post-pandemic city; it is the space where people will queue to wait for food, to enter banks, to get groceries; it is the space where you’ll wait for your turn at the doctor, or to get to a store; it is our gyms and daycares. The implementation of this plan has started with the city’s Open Streets program, but we need to quickly develop a plan that ensures these routes are made permanent and the space of the street is returned to whom it has always belonged, to the people. Marvel Architects is a solutions-driven design practice that integrates context and nature into every project, meeting each design challenge by listening to its surroundings.

Robert Paley ▷ Regional Government Collaboration Platform: Creating a Networked Region Posted on September 4, 2020 Coronavirus, like most emerging public challenges, ignores political boundaries. The few successes and many failures of the COVD-19 response have laid bare the paucity of institutional coordinating mechanisms across the extraordinary numbers and levels of government entities. The shortfalls in the pandemic response argue for the creation of a regional collaboration tool for public officials and stakeholders to coordinate across jurisdictional boundaries and levels of government throughout metropolitan New York. COVID-19 triggered a massive shift to work at home (and for many New Yorkers, work from remote second homes) which has spawned speculation that the viability of New York City is being undermined. Paradoxically, the rapidly adopted internet- based communications platforms, when harnessed to public ends, can serve to reinforce the importance of place. These platforms have demonstrated that distance does not create a barrier to collaboration and there has emerged a new norm that in-person meetings are not required. This means that regional public leaders can now more easily collaborate, and the vast NY metro region can be effectively shrunk through an internet communication tool adapted to public needs. This proposed internet-based platform could be developed in support of near-term COVID-19 response efforts, but ultimately would strengthen the region to confront imminent challenges from rebuilding after COVID-19 to responding to the stresses of climate change. Lessons from COVID-19: The public sector is disorganized at a regional level. There is no forum for addressing long-standing regional problems, such as the disconnect between regional transit investment and local land use policy, let alone novel emergencies such as COVID-19. Expert and well-considered opinion is increasingly ignored in public discussion where loud and uninformed voices often prevail. The disorganized COVID-19 response at the national level was amplified by the disdainful rejection by many leaders of scientific judgment —the spotlight was thrust on the states. The multi-state collaboration initiated by Governor Cuomo developed action principles followed by a reopening organized through multi-county regions. Although ad hoc, the regional cross-jurisdictional COVID-19 response created a consistent message of response, and developed criteria, based on data, for re-opening. The same cross-jurisdictional approach supported by professional advice and data is seen in Italy’s successful COVID-19 recovery. Its government is guided by scientific committees backed by local health officials who daily gather data on key virus indicators and send them to regional authorities, who then forward them to national authorities. Government policy decisions are based on a weekly snapshot of the country’s health. Proposal: Starting with the three metro NY states, a networking and information platform for regional and inter-municipal coordination should be created. This is not intended to be a public forum – although key elements would be publicly available. This networking and information platform would have two primary functions: Link local and state level officials, citizen stakeholders and agencies, and provide discussion forums and access to information and other resources to help local officials address issues which are regional in nature or have regional implications. Aggregate and curate objective data to provide regional snapshots to policy makers – travel patterns, construction permits, employment figures or health indicators, for example. The platform would link to existing state and local data bases and eventually would include privately generated and aggregated data that under future data laws could be made publicly available. It would also generate and provide opinion data unique to the platform, such as creating a regular leadership opinion survey of critical issues that could serve as a public advance warning of emerging issues, whether environmental, economic or social. The platform should be coupled with a mandate from each participating state that public officials consider regional views when taking actions, which parallels existing requirements that environmental impacts are taken into consideration. Regular leadership surveys could provide insights to other leaders and the public on emerging issues. Discussion forums could debate proposed actions informed by a range of professionals and stakeholders who have defined access privileges to the forums. Over time the platform could provide a counterweight to the “loudest voices syndrome” and internet “outrage” where in public meetings, on the internet, or in the press the most extreme views get the greatest airtime. These forums would not be intended to eliminate extreme views, but would serve to put them in context of other approaches with reasoned responses. Infrastructure investment, for example, requires a long term and regional perspective to design and finance which contrasts with the local, short term perspective typical of most public discussion. A striking case was the Hudson River tunnel project (known as ARC) which was abruptly cancelled in 2010 after nearly two decades of design and funding efforts conducted largely out of public view. Surprisingly for a project of such regional importance, the cancellation generated little discussion among regional leaders, the general public or the press. Had a regional communication platform existed, the ARC project may have been more generally known and debated and the action to terminate it may have flashed a warning signal on the regional platform, alerting leaders and, perhaps, encouraging solutions to save the project. Rationalizing and streamlining inter-government communications through a common platform could have many regular applications. The platform could help coordinate land use policies among neighboring jurisdictions and affected stakeholders in a more fluid and productive manner than the prescriptive and formal communication used for environmental review. It could assist in aligning local land use policies with regional transportation investments. The platform could facilitate inter-municipal initiatives ranging from developing and implementing shared service delivery to coordinating affordable housing policies. This platform could also assist existing initiatives such as New York State’s Regional Economic Development Councils with both internal coordination among council members and outreach to key stakeholders. Key elements: Capacity to encourage networks of public officials and stakeholders. Broad inclusion in the network would have elected officials, public officials and stakeholders admitted through a gating process. This would not be an open public forum, although views and ideas generated would be made public. The platform would overcome the enormous scale of the New York region. Interchange would be routine, not ad hoc. The network would create value for participants; new ideas and successful initiatives could quickly be disseminated and discussed, critical information and data would be readily available. Regional and state decision makers would be informed of local conditions and views. At the same time, there should be legislative mandates that local officials take regional views into account even with respect to local matters. Over time this networking could help foster a greater sense of regional identity and purpose. Leadership surveys and real time data. Regularly taking the “pulse of the leaders” and publishing this survey information would identify issues confronting localities and gauge leadership views of proposed solutions. Surveys of the opinions of those who bear the responsibility of confronting problems as well as of professionals engaged with specific issues can provide context for public discussion. Platform data could be available initially by tapping into publicly generated information and eventually should incorporate large-scale data about the public which is privately generated and held but which should in the future be available for public use and benefit through negotiation or legislative mandate. Implementation. This platform can be constructed initially to support regional COVID-19 responses and the officials and jurisdictions involved. The network should be broadened to include a full range of subject areas and expanded to add jurisdictions. Eventually this initial tristate forum might add contiguous states and even beyond. The tool would not replace existing decision-making processes; instead it would help inform them. It will not eliminate disputes and political confrontation. Different stakeholders with differing interests will still have competing goals. It should, however, reduce the inherent distrust and inefficiencies resulting from our existing governmental fragmentation where public officials rarely interact across jurisdictions, and where even neighboring towns typically don’t collaborate. There will be issues of governance and rules as this tool is created, but just the process of setting it up should help to create bonds among separate jurisdictions that are often not in communication. One physical result of the pandemic is the potential expansion of what is considered to be the New York region as work migrates to places outside the traditional commuting boundaries of New York City. This follows the pattern of prior periods in which epidemics and new technology acted to disperse New York’s economy and population. However, in each case, public initiatives effectively harnessed the power of new communication technologies which reinforced New York’s central role in the periods when canals, then railroads, then telephones came to dominate. This is the time for the public sector to respond to the digital age. Elliot Scarangello ▷ 														 Elliot Scarangello is a Volunteer Fellow at the Urban Design Forum.

An Analysis of Subway Ridership During the Pandemic Posted on September 4, 2020 The following maps were created in order to explore the ways in which Covid-19 has affected subway ridership as well as how the effects vary spatially across the city. In order to explore this topic we took a look at subway ridership change by station between January 2020 and April 2020 (when Covid-19 was rapidly increasing in NYC) over three different metrics: Covid-19 case rate by zip code, income by census tract, and population percent white by census tract. Income and demographic data for NYC was acquired from the American Community Survey (ACS) which is a demographics survey program conducted on a yearly basis by the U.S. Census Bureau and uses a series of monthly samples to produce annually updated estimates for the same small areas (census tracts and block groups) that the decennial census uses. Covid-19 case rate data was acquired from the NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Data repository. This data is reported using modified ZIP code tabulation areas as opposed to census tracts. The case rate map shows that the areas with the greatest reduction in subway ridership, for the most part, have experienced the lowest rates of Covid-19 across the city. This is not to say that riding the subway directly causes Covid-19 cases, but instead that those that continued to ride the subway after Covid-19 began are more likely be essential workers and therefore are still required to go to work and be exposed to the virus in many ways other than the subway. We can see that the outer boroughs are the most affected and likewise have had the smallest reduction in subway usage; this is likely because the outer boroughs are generally less affluent than Manhattan and have a higher portion of low income workers who are unable to work from home during the pandemic. Additionally, those who live in Manhattan are more likely to be able to walk to work and during the pandemic many who normally take public transit may have decided to walk instead. The income map shows that lower income areas had less reduction in ridership when compared to areas of higher income. Higher income areas are places where people have jobs that allow them to either work from home, stop working all together, or to leave the city for country homes. This caused a steep decline in subway ridership in these areas whereas in lower income areas people are less likely to have a job that is work from home compatible and more likely to be essential workers which caused the subway ridership to decrease much less. This map shows that predominantly whiter areas are more likely to have experienced a drop in subway ridership compared to less predominantly white areas. This is likely because the non-white population is more likely to have a job that requires them to continue to commute to work during the pandemic and displays that a large portion of the city’s essential workers are Black and Latino populations."

People's Pocket Park: Main Streets as a Center of City Life Posted on September 4, 2020 CUBE, Climate Urgency in the Built Environment, proposes the People’s Pocket Park (P3) – a multi-phase kit of parts informed by community input – reimagining our main streets as the center of city life. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how we work, live, and interact with our environment. Proximity to outdoor space has never been more beneficial. Urban residents have become increasingly reliant on and engaged in their immediate neighborhoods, with public transit options reduced, socializing outdoors, and increased time in the home. In March, New Yorkers experienced a driverless NYC. With parks closed, we played on the sidewalk and walked in the street. Why, in the past, has unsafe, loud, and polluting vehicular traffic taken over our streets? In the wake of the pandemic, the City of New York must replace car and subway congestion with green infrastructure, such as cross-borough bike transit, bus-only lanes, and pedestrian streets. NYC’s initial rollout of Open Streets and Open Restaurants is a step in the right direction, but the implementation of these programs and their distribution lack foresight, equity, and proper management. Despite the shortcomings of these government programs, they have displayed NYC’s ability to respond quickly to a social and economic crisis. We must channel this energy towards the longevity of an equitable and sustainable future. Our city is in urgent need of creative solutions and political support that invests in the dignity of our most vulnerable communities. The People’s Pocket Park (P3) is designed for neighborhoods that have disproportionately borne the brunt of the pandemic as a result of longstanding economic neglect, poor air quality, and a dearth of outdoor space. P3 is a phased prototypical strategy that permanently implements green streets in a manner that is commercially viable, as well as pedestrian and environmentally friendly. Upon installment, each Pocket Park would introduce roughly 4,000 square feet of additional outdoor space available for commercial and public use. The scheme is adaptable to any urban corridor, with the exception of those along a bus route. P3 invites communities to shape their built environments. The People’s Pocket Park provides a space safe for pedestrians with improved air quality that nearby residents can personalize through public programming of their choice. “The more successfully a city mingles everyday diversity of uses and users in its everyday streets, the more successfully, casually (and economically) its people thereby enliven and support well-located parks that can thus give back grace and delight to their neighborhoods instead of vacuity.” – Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities. For the vitality of our neighborhoods, a reimagined streetscape becomes critical to ensure passersby feel safe and comfortable, social distancing guidelines are maintained, and local business can continue to operate and flourish. P3 fosters cross community interactions in outdoor spaces. In order to achieve the longevity of Open Streets, our streets must be: Good for business Safe for pedestrians Environmentally friendly Conducive for commercial deliveries. In addition, infrastructure like storm drainage, garbage collection, bus routes, and access to fire hydrants must not be disrupted. The implementation of P3 is broken down into three phases to allow for sustained effectivity in the event of gradually available funding. Phase 1 calls for the removal of parking, conversion to one-way streets, and the installation of temporary ramps to receive deliveries. Phase 2 replaces the temporary ramps with curb cuts and invites the community to paint murals using the new public space as their canvas. Phase 3 involves excavation, planting, and the installation of bioswales. Grass provides large permeable surfaces while trees grow to protect pedestrians from traffic and provide shade. P3 is an adaptable kit of parts that is informed by community outreach. The process empowers neighborhoods to shape their built environments while reaping the social, environmental, and economic benefits of green infrastructure.

By removing cars and related ramps, and providing more space for pedestrians, bikes and transit, the bridge will move more people and create a stronger, more sustainable, and more equitable connection between Downtown Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan, and beyond. Prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic and demonstrations against police brutality, the Reimagining Brooklyn Bridge competition brief required streets and shared spaces to address the present moment and past injustices, and to enable peaceful gatherings, safe transportation, a healthy environment and opportunities for small businesses to flourish. Image by BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group By restoring the bridge to its original design accommodating public transit, walking and public realm, the Back to the Future proposal re-invents one of the most visible icons in the world. The proposal expresses the transformation of our city streets and infrastructure for people and places first, while we manage automobility to be less intrusive, and bring the bridge into the 21st century. The original Brooklyn Bridge anchorages and their surroundings were integral parts of the neighborhoods they connected, with significant public transit facilities, public spaces, and even commercial spaces within their structures. 1950s vehicular infrastructure supplanted these civic features, and forms a barrier for adjacent neighborhoods. The Back to the Future approach would restore the anchorages to their original form, allowing for public activation, engagement with, and new appreciation of the incredible historic structures. 1950s-era rampways could still be preserved in segments by creating elevated greenways for additional pedestrian access to the bridge, while preserving a visual timeline of the bridge’s urban history. Removing these ramps would release 32 acres of land for public and environmental benefit on both sides of the bridge, more than 5x the total area of the Highline, to combat climate change and urban heat increase, and offer recreational spaces for adjacent neighborhoods and a growing city. Image by BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group Today the bridge doesn’t meet users’ needs and some—particularly cyclists and walkers—are especially affected. We want to create a remarkable mobility experience for all New Yorkers, that is more than a piece of infrastructure, but an incredible experience. That said, many New Yorkers still do get around by car for critical functions. The proposed multi-modal design imagines a gradual shift away from private vehicles to release space for pedestrians and bike access across the bridge over time. Our travel behaviors have changed in the past decade. We continue to move robustly towards cycling, walking and more efficient mobility systems. In response, as new mobility systems and technologies emerge, the bridge can adapt and accommodate a range of mobility scenarios and universally accessible needs. Community engagement should be undertaken at each step of the way to align on the best path forward. So while seemingly radical, the Back to the Future is possible today, and implementable with phased interventions over time.

Street Dining Pavilion: Exploring the Design Capabilities of Social Distancing Posted on September 4, 2020 Sean Daly/Windtunnel Visualization “A new design genre was born last month when New York City began allowing restaurants, which had been closed for on-premises dining since March, to take over miles of sidewalks and streets for outdoor seating… These oases, surrounded by plants and shaded by wide umbrellas, have temporarily transformed the city….The promise of these outdoor cafes is a few hours of relief from our well-founded fears.” – Pete Wells, New York Times Introduction In the past few weeks, encouraged by loosened city restrictions, thousands of restaurateurs across the five boroughs of New York have introduced outdoor dining on converted sidewalk and street areas adjacent to their indoor spaces, which remain off-limits due to concerns about spread of the COVID-19 virus. The result has been a vibrant and lively transformation of the streetscape amidst an otherwise dark and unhappy moment in the city’s life—not only bringing new energy and vitality to the city’s public spaces, but also restoring economic life (and with it, a range of employment opportunities) to the city’s crucial but battered hospitality industry. Another idea: Put everything outside. Some American cities…have done just that, by announcing the closure of streets to free up outdoor dining space for restaurants. But for many cities, wide-scale al fresco dining is unrealistic… because we can’t ask the weather to stop. There will be snow…wind…and rain…An open-air restaurant is a lovely thing, but ceilings were invented for a reason. – Henry Grabar, Slate The Concept The Street Dining Pavilion—initially proposed in March 2020, before the current trend took hold—is a demountable, “kit-of-parts” installation designed to encourage and expand urban outdoor dining by providing a full fabric canopy roof to allow extensive protection for diners from rain and sun, more convenient operation for restaurant staff through the provision of outdoor stations and storage, and an extended opening schedule that can continue through the fall and winter, through the use of windbreak panels and electric heat lamps, integrated into the canopy structure and decking. The pavilion occupies a parking lane and adjacent section of sidewalk, providing a curbside dining experience, looking back toward the sidewalk, not unlike the famed cafes of Rome’s Via Veneto. The Street Dining Pavilion builds on architect James Sanders’ longtime interest in the use of canopy and kiosk structures for outdoor activations. In the early 1980s, for The Parks Council, a civic advocacy group, he and a colleague designed and built an open-air bookmarket, flower market, and two cafés in Bryant Park to revitalize the then-troubled landmark space behind the New York Public Library, the new amenities quickly brought the public back into the park, transformed its use, and initiated the long-term restoration that followed. More recently, in 2010, Sanders and Pentagram’s James Biber collaborated on Riverways, a proposal for a system of low-cost floating recreation docks along the Hudson River, employing matching canopy structures and kiosks to shelter activities and provide a highly visible marker of the new linkages between land and water. “Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio have wisely held off letting restaurants operate indoors, where diners are at the mercy of unreliable air-conditioning systems. If, come cooler weather, distrust of the great indoors persists and restaurants can’t lure customers back into their dining rooms, New York should invest heavily in heat lamps, emulating Northern Europe’s virtually year-round outdoor dining culture…” – Justin Davidson, New York magazine The Design The installation consists of a wood slat deck that “floats” a few inches above the street and sidewalk (with adjustable levelers to account for uneven surfaces), on which sits a fabric canopy to provide rain and sun protection for the tables below. The structure also accommodates heat lamps, clear windbreak panels, and lighting, allowing for continued use in colder weather. The canopy and deck fit together firmly, creating a single structural unit that requires no foundations. They represent what is essentially a piece of street furniture, which can be assembled and placed onto any existing street and sidewalk surface (and disassembled with equal ease). Each canopy structure accommodates four full-size dining tables seating 16 to 24 people, with proper social distancing between diners. Several canopies can be placed side by side to accommodate anywhere from 50 to 70 covers, enough to ensure a profitable operation. In one of these segments, two tables are replaced with two openable kiosks outfitted with countertops, shelving, utensil and glass storage, removable trash containers, and serving supplies and equipment, which provide service stations by day and lockable storage overnight, allowing for convenient daily operation. The canopy-and-deck structure accommodates electric heat lamps and clear windbreak panels, allowing operation of the dining pavilion to continue uninterrupted into cooler seasons. In the evening, integrated lighting fixtures throw a gentle wash of light onto the underside of the fabric canopies, reflecting a vibrant and welcoming glow on the activities beneath. As the diagrams on the following four slides demonstrate, the dining pavilion sits atop the street and sidewalk surface like a large piece of furniture, and—also quite like a “flat-pack,” IKEA-style piece of furniture—can be swiftly assembled from pre-fabricated components that lock together into the completed installation.

Transforming City Streets Into Green Spaces Posted on September 4, 2020 http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/Flatiron_Animated.mp4 As the coronavirus lockdown took force of major metropolises, the sounds of taxi horns hushed, the skies cleared and pollution lifted. There were reports of city dwellers waking up to the sounds of nature and the song of birds, something never heard before amidst all the noise. As New York City started to peek its head out from its four-month hibernation – unlocking bodega doors, flipping open blinds, and turning around its “Open for Business” signs – there were obvious unintended positives that almost instantaneously took hold of the city that never sleeps. As a result of unforeseen positives revealed during the pandemic, WATG conceptualized an urban planning solution that shapes a new vision for a greener New York City. The concept, Green Block, was an internal innovation competition focused on how its team of leading urban planners, landscape architects and designers could use their skills, and lessons learned from the pandemic, to transform urban spaces in a post-pandemic world for the better. Green Block allows for a green, carless, alfresco-hopping, streetscape vision for New York’s streets. Flatiron Green Block. Image Courtesy of WATG. Focusing on the intersection of Manhattan’s Flatiron Building, an iconic symbol for the city itself, Green Block claws back space from the roads and reclaims it for the people and environment. Green Block is built using a modular program that transforms city streets into green spaces using a kit-of-parts system that is maintenance-free and created from 100% recyclable materials. Green Block not only adds greenery to existing cafes and shop fronts but it creates untapped revenue opportunities for retail, commerce, and restaurants, and helps clean and filter city air while beautifying streetscapes. Green Block brings limitless value to cities and destinations – serving as a living, breathing solution to air filtration; reducing car noise, impact and pollution; providing homes for the world’s decreasing bee population; and increasing the amount of space for people to exercise and leisure. The solution provides greater opportunity for cyclists and walkers, replacing paved footpaths with lush plants; and increasing street appeal for restaurants and retail – providing untapped opportunities for outdoor dining and shopping. Restaurant operators can also use the new outdoor space to grow vegetables, herbs or fruits to serve on their menus. New Yorkers should not forget what a cleaner city looks like, and we should all strive to find a way to adopt new ways of living that contributes to a healthier and more sustainable way of life. Our cities have long been overdue for transformation. As some flee for greener landscapes in the wake of COVID-19, Green Block proves that you don’t need to sacrifice one for the other – you can, in fact, have both the urban and the green lifestyle.

A Blueprint for Shared Summer Streets in Hudson Posted on September 4, 2020 Overview of Hudson Shared Summer Streets, New York Cities across the world are working in real time to grapple with COVID-19 and its threat to public safety and devastating economic impacts. To meet our immediate health needs and to chart a safe course to allow businesses, institutions, and services to re-open, cities are innovating and adapting. Cities big and small are rapidly changing their streets, sometimes over the course of several days, to help their residents stay safe in a time of crisis and to prepare people and societies for the health, social, and economic recovery ahead. This Blueprint for Shared Summer Streets for Hudson, New York helps the City of Hudson to do just that: Shifting how space is allocated or shared and rethinking which uses are prioritized during the Summer of 2020 to help the city recover and residents to reconnect with each other after weeks of staying at home. It also presents an unprecedented opportunity to initiate conversation about longer term change by expanding the concept of public input from a public hearing to a lived experiment, where residents can vote with their feet quite literally and the city can evaluate potential long-term changes and their impact on city health and residents well-being. Finally, while tailored specifically to Hudson and developed with Hudson residents, businesses, and city officials it serves as a blueprint for re-opening “Main Street” in many towns and villages across New York State and the country to reallocate street space for the health and safety of its residents. On-Street parking lane occupied by dining and vending spaces Background Hudson, New York is a small city 120 miles north of New York Harbor on the Hudson River. Chartered as a city in 1785 and growing rapidly in the early 19th century, its economy was originally dependent on its port. Today, a growing portion of its 6,700 residents rely on income from tourism, second homes and weekend visitors to the city and surrounding region. Warren Street, its main street, is home to over 300 small businesses and cultural organizations that serve residents and visitors. The Shared Summer Streets program in Hudson strives to expand and enhance public space for all Hudson residents, businesses and community organizations to safely reopen and re-connect with each other. Many of the businesses along Warren Street have small footprints. Safety concerns by customers, as well as State regulations, will severely limit their ability to do business indoors. In addition, research increasingly shows that the commonly accepted rule of maintaining six feet of distance does not apply to indoor environments where factors such as the airflow of the air conditioner and the prolonged time people might spend for work or meal in a restaurant may contribute to transmission of COVID-19. A recent survey of customers emphasizes the need to do business outdoors. Design Strategies Occupy Public Space Businesses can occupy sidewalks and contiguous on-street parking spaces. The city has adapted an existing permitting process (the “dumpster permit”), to allow businesses and organizations to expand their operations into public space. Businesses or organizations wishing to expand, can do so by applying to the City of Hudson Police Department. Applications will be available throughout the program, and application site plans may be amended. Permitted businesses will be responsible for these areas 24/7 for the duration of the program as defined by the executive order. To offset the lost revenue from metered parking, the city is contemplating a weekly fee of $24 -the cost of paying the meter for one week for such permit. This includes maintaining waste receptacles on their property and directing patrons to use them, and for securing all tables, chairs, umbrellas and any other equipment used in the parking or sidewalk areas. Share Public Space To increase safety, and add more space for pedestrians to maintain distancing requirements, parts of Warren Street and Front Street will become “Shared Streets” from Friday to Sunday, 10am to sunset. Traffic will be limited to local traffic at 5mph and barriers at every intersection will slow vehicles. Drivers will still be able to drive to any address on these streets and will share the road with pedestrians. Emergency vehicles as well as public transportation will be allowed through at all times. Businesses can occupy a portion of the sidewalk as well as on-street parking spaces in front of their business. On weekends, vehicles will share the street with pedestrians to allow for more room for distancing. In its initial phase, these barriers are simple wooden barricades with laminated signs. Residents will be able to access their blocks during the week as normal, and normal parking rules will apply. Businesses and community groups with permits for parking spaces will also occupy those spaces on these days. Activate Public Space Public parks along Warren and Front Streets will be activated as public seating areas and furnished with restrooms and hand sanitizing stations. In order to ensure equitable access to Shared Summer Streets, these areas will provide amenities to those who might not be able to afford a sit-down meal in a restaurant or who feel more comfortable with picking up takeout orders. These public areas also provide public restrooms and hand sanitizing stations, as businesses will have to limit the number of people indoors and cannot offer these facilities to the general public.

Distance Dining: A Reopening Toolkit Posted on September 4, 2020 Distance Dining was developed and submitted to the Urban Design Forum in May of 2020, eight weeks into the Coronavirus Pandemic. The ambition was to create an equitably distributed architectural and digital toolkit that both built and signaled a safe city-approved outdoor dining experience for New Yorkers. At the time of submission, no plans were issued by the city on how restaurants could safely re-open. On June 22 New York City entered Phase 2 of reopening which allowed outdoor dining on sidewalks, roadways, and where available open-street seating through the city’s freshly minted Open Restaurants program. Restaurants that had not completely shuttered with little notice, were faced with an ‘adapt or die’ scenario as they worked to figure seating, tables, spacing, disinfection, plastic barrier, and traffic protections – all while making their outdoor arrangements appealing enough to attract diners and assure safety. The Distance Dining team is thrilled to see many of the ideas we imagined working well throughout our neighborhoods; bringing vitality back to the streets and supporting a portion of the estimated 80,000 jobs created by New York’s restaurants. With the Open Restaurants program a success, there is now the added promise that the city will permanently allow restaurants to continue the use of curbside space for outdoor warm-weather dining. It is our hope then that the Mayor’s office will work not only to continue to provide the economic opportunity outdoor dining provides but will execute plans and partnerships that can ensure equitable access to the material resources required for restaurants to survive amidst a pandemic that is far from over. Current private partnerships providing these amenities – favor the few. With Open Restaurants impact benefiting only 9,000 of New York’s last counted 26,000 restaurants, extending the program to provide warm-weather resources and cold-weather solutions beyond guidelines and open-street allowances will be critical to preserving the cultural and economic cornerstone that are New York City’s restaurants. Goals Summary The Coronavirus pandemic has upended urban life. As this is being written there are yet no formal guidelines developed for the safe reopening of the restaurants who are the heart of our city. With the solutions for long-term viability remaining to be seen, it’s all hands on deck to safely help facilitate an early first step towards recovery for New York City’s restaurants. Outdoor street dining as a form of economic and social recovery has selectively begun in Europe with early studies now starting to emerge across U.S. cities. We look to work together and learn from the wider national and global restaurant community while customizing a solution for the specific and indistinguishable needs of New York City. Clear visual graphic markers as part of the new normal will ensure proper seating distance clarity for restaurant hosts as well as the elimination of any grey area for patrons and fellow diners. Forecast This forecast predicts the methods required to expedite an architectural and digital toolkit that both builds and signals a safe city-approved summer outdoor dining experience for New Yorkers. Together we imagine what it would look like for New York City to close selected streets during the summer and put those block’s restaurants outside. Transforming whole streets-into extended and protected cafe seating. Combined units for a distanced communal table Sample Blocks Three communal tables within a block. Alternate table distribution and open public seating. Toolkit Maintain Social Distances: Install well designed and inviting visual and physical markers. Reduce Contact Points: Provide contactless menus, reservations, and payments via patron’s cell phones. Socialize Safety: Generate a public campaign around safe Distance Dining locations and protocols. The Distance Dining Toolkit offers the City’s restaurants the means to quickly mobilize elected individual blocks by providing a city-sanctioned downloadable guide and instructions. With templates for clear table spacing, service paths, pedestrian entry and egress, and safety protocols established in direct collaboration with the city and its health agencies, the toolkit not only empowers restaurants, but helps to educate the public on distance dining. The use of uniform reusable materials eliminates any barriers to entry for participants. Built using only NYPD Crowd Barriers, architect/city provided plywood table templates, and restaurants own chairs, streets can be readied in a matter of hours. Through a clear and conformed rollout, we exponentially increase not only patron acceptance of outdoor dining, but the safety and success for every participating restaurant and worker. What is in the Toolkit? DISCLAIMER: All work would be done in direct coordination with the appropriate NYC and NYS Health Agencies and Task Forces. All work would require agency and task force review and approval. The Toolkit merely provides our collaborative’s ideas and designs as a means to support the city’s anticipated efforts to safely reopen.

John Messengale ▷ Integrating Social Distancing into Street Planning Posted on September 4, 2020 Pedestrianized street in Lower Manhattan Over past several years, the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) and Buro Happold have worked in conjunction with industry experts and key stakeholders from New York City to reimagine Lower Manhattan’s street network to be more people friendly. In 2019, Make Way for Lower Manhattan, an innovative shared-streets plan for the Financial District, proposed steps to address the challenges associated with high volumes of pedestrian activity in areas with limited space. The vision plan sets forth a series of strategies that can be used to decongest areas in FiDi and throughout the city, allowing for safer, cleaner, and more enjoyable streetscape. As New York City continues many months in quarantine, temporary measures to quell the spread of COVID-19 are now becoming realities the public will be forced to adopt for the foreseeable future. New York City, in particular, is grappling with changes to its fundamental character: density. Despite waves of escapees to homes outside the city, millions of New Yorkers will be navigating an entirely new urban landscape for months, perhaps years, to come. While the subway and above-ground street grid are relieved from their usual high volumes of traffic, the opportunity for a new approach to pedestrian and public space is becoming increasingly apparent in a new era of social distancing. Amsterdam shared streets FDNA and Buro Happold are all too familiar with the challenges associated with dense pedestrian spaces. Make Way for Lower Manhattan laid out a number of interventions that, although not originally intended to aid social distancing efforts, may offer solutions to some of the challenges associated with personal space in the public realm due to COVID-19. One tool for this is concept of “shared streets”, which has been implemented successfully in places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Bonn. Pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles share the street at all times, forcing vehicles to be extra cautious as they move. The increased pedestrian space can offer stress relief across areas with narrow sidewalks, which pose significant hurdles to social distancing efforts. Additionally, shared streets will better the streets year round. Priority paths like a tourist route in Lower Manhattan can encourage safe movement throughout the district; and improved services like scaffolding, vendor, and waste collection will reduce obstacles in streetscape that make people walk closer together. Lower Manhattan scaffolding congestion Precedents from other cities in the process of reintegrating into life after lockdown suggests that public space will be in high demand. In cities across the world, storefronts are reopening and serving customers at their doorstep rather than allowing them to come inside. Public officials are recognizing this changing landscape. Recently, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer asserted that pedestrianized plazas created through street closures could be monitored to ensure utilization of appropriate social distancing measures by the public, rather than by law enforcement officials. Her call for self-monitoring throughout the reintegration process reinforces the public’s responsibility in the reopening process. In response to this need, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio and Speaker Corey Johnson announced plans to implement up to 100 miles of safe streets. Tools like Sidewalk Widths NYC, a tool developed by urban planner Meli Harvey that maps sidewalk widths throughout the five boroughs, can help to pinpoint areas where social distancing for pedestrians becomes challenging. In recent months since the onset of the pandemic, Lower Manhattan has seen significant adaptations to move towards a more people-friendly public realm: Partnership between DOT and Downtown Alliance for a closed street on Pearl Street from State to Cedar Streets as part of the NYC Open Streets program for Covid-19 social distancing. DOT and the Community Board are beginning a Re-Imagining of Bowling Green to enhance pedestrian and bike experience The City Council and Van Alen Institute has initiative a design competition to reimagine the pedestrian access leading onto the Brooklyn Bridge The Black Lives Matter street mural on Centre Street demonstrates the cultural value of our streets. Until the threat of COVID-19 is greatly reduced, New Yorkers will be living in a new paradigm. For the time being, the city’s hustle-and-bustle will likely be replaced with a slow-moving alternative – one where walking and biking take the place of a crowded subway, and proximity reigns king. The shift toward outdoor plazas and shared streets will likely spark new demands for site-assessment tools, place making strategies, visitation models, and frameworks outlined in Make Way for Lower Manhattan. FDNA can serve as an example for other neighborhood organizations that wish to make their streets as safe and habitable as possible in the midst of society’s recovery from COVID-19.

Exploring the Role of Parks as Community Recovery & Resilience Posted on September 4, 2020 Courtesy: NYC Parks New York City has faced two distinct crises in less than a decade where parks have played a central role in community recovery. In October 2012, Superstorm Sandy roiled through New York City, and now we are living through a crisis of a different form with the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on New York City in both cases were results of larger global crises. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, a symptom of global climate change, our city waterfront communities were devastated and lives were tragically lost. As a result of the global spread of COVID-19, another disaster not contained by borders, communities all across our city are facing tragic loss and economic instability. While different, these two events share similarities as we think about the role parks and open spaces play in recovery. Parks and open spaces are public amenities that serve as a backyard and infrastructure for all New Yorkers regardless of race, socio-economic status or any other factor. They are the site of summer vacation plans for many, especially low-income residents. They are accessible spaces for activities like sports, engaging with public art, birding, picnicking, swimming, running and walking. Our parks provide both resilience from climate change and a positive impact on mental health providing community resilience. While many needs have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, one thing is clear, as it was after Superstorm Sandy — our parks and open spaces are needed more than ever. While there were many imminent needs facing the city after Superstorm Sandy that ranged from housing to food insecurity to support for small businesses impacted by the storm, similar to needs emerging now, there was a recognition that New Yorkers would need to safely access parks and beaches. In the wake of such devastation, the task took the coordination of multiple agencies, community input, and an unprecedented sequence of planning, design, and construction all occurring in under a year. Under the leadership of the Mayor’s Office and NYC Parks Commissioner Veronica M. White, resilient comfort and lifeguard stations were placed on beaches and elevated above the flood plain, trees and debris removed, sand replenishment coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was underway; and in the summer of 2013, just seven months after Superstorm Sandy devastated shoreline communities, beaches from Rockaway to Coney Island to Staten Island’s Midland Beach had record attendance. This was not just a symbol of community resilience, but a true embodiment. Much like the coordinated effort to bring back our parks after Sandy, the city must simultaneously incorporate creative and safe ways for the public to access all parks and beaches in a socially distant manner. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a different reality whereby climate resilient building does not make parks and open spaces safe to visit as usual. However, both climate resilience and mitigating public health risks presented by COVID-19 while allowing New Yorkers to access open space are equally important. The design community can play a key role in providing necessary planning options, guidance and creativity. A recent example in Domino Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where large socially distant circles were painted on the lawn that park goers used to maintain a safe space from each other, proved to be a concept that was both effective and creative. Much like the design community reimagined lifeguard stations along city beaches and a new boardwalk in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, designers are uniquely positioned to innovate other creative interventions and enhancements that encourage use of parks safely while limiting the risk of spread of this deadly virus. In collaboration with public health and park officials, and community residents, urban designers and landscape architects should be at the table to provide their expertise and help develop amenable solutions. Social distancing circles in Domino Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images In addition to reimagining physical spaces, the impact of COVID-19 requires the non-profit organizations that support these spaces to think creatively about their operations going forward. As parks conservancies note, the pandemic has resulted in existing and projected gaps within New York City public-private partnerships serving our parks and open spaces. Staffing shortages due to looming government budget cuts, loss of revenue and an anticipated drop in private donations put restoration of natural areas, environmental monitoring efforts, public educational programs, park maintenance and more at risk. As we saw in the days after Sandy, many New Yorkers have come together once again to provide support. On March 20, 2020 Bloomberg Philanthropies together with several other foundations and the New York Community Trust launched the NYC COVID-19 Response & Impact Fund; a $75 million dollar commitment to support social services and cultural organizations through a competitive grant and interest-free loan process. Additionally, the City Parks Foundation is leading a group of parks conservancies to advocate for necessary government funding and also announced the NYC Green Relief & Recovery Fund, which will provide privately funded grants to park groups through a competitive process. These are great steps in alleviating the financial need for non-profit partners in the short term. An impactful use of private or any government funds that may become available as part of a COVID-19 relief package would be to revive and expand two successful programs implemented by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation post-Superstorm Sandy. The NYC Parks Fellowship & Conservation Corps Program and Jamaica Bay Restoration Corps provided paid opportunities for recent high school and college graduates over the age of eighteen to gain experience in environmental related fields and restore impacted areas after the storm. The latter continues within Jamaica Bay parks and open spaces under the direction of the American Littoral Society, with support from the Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy. The NYC Parks Conservation Corps provided opportunities within the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation and conservancy partners for the next generation of leaders dedicated to protecting and restoring New York City’s parks. This 40-week paid program was funded by private donors and administered by the city agency. The Jamaica Bay Restoration Corps, a workforce program which initially received funding from the United States Department of Labor, assisted with much needed debris removal and wetland restoration. A new, expanded hybrid program that combines these programs and serves park conservancies citywide could both address needs of park conservancies presented by the pandemic, as well as provide employment for young New Yorkers from face limited opportunities in light of temporary funding shortages and workforce reductions. Roles and responsibilities of fellows could range from socially distant field work to remote opportunities in research or building virtual programming, based on need and operating within local government guidelines. Through such a program, selected fellows from the New York City area would gain meaningful employment, expand their skills, and access professional development. The fellows could work with many of the landscape architects that design New York City and State park projects and the program would ensure that young people in New York City from all backgrounds can learn about potential careers in environment and urban design fields. These fellows would play a role in recovery and would be better equipped to face future global disasters as professionals. There are certainly differences in both of these crises, but each has proven that New Yorkers can work together and creatively address methods of rebuilding while meaningfully engaging residents and our vibrant design community.

Shifting Perspectives on Street Life Posted on September 4, 2020 Street section diagram During New York’s stay-at-home orders, I came to appreciate how much of my life is lived in the public realm. I sometimes yearned for a commute, albeit a short and safe one, but I also relished the neighborhood scale at which my life is now lived. I used to stop at the grocery store on the way home from the office, but now I walk or bike there from my apartment. I go outside at lunch for a quick walk. Instead of buying lunch in Midtown, I walk to my local bakery. This scale of living is one factor of many that may help us to reconsider and reimagine our streets. An enormous percentage of public space is ceded to motor vehicles. And setting aside the many other issues that come with them – noise, waste heat, crashes, etc – this allocation of space is inefficient when buses, subways, bikes, and feet can all move more people per hour than single occupancy vehicles. During a pandemic, when the key recommendation for limiting viral spread is to physically distance oneself from others, this allocation is not only inefficient, it is unjust. The neighborhood scale allows us to shift the way we perceive the street, not simply as a corridor for moving people as far and fast as possible, but as a space for quick and small trips via walking or biking, for recreation and exercise, and for the “third space” outside our homes and work. These uses existed before COVID, but the pandemic may allow us to see them in a new and clearer light. And this shift in perception may also allow us to see the streets in even more new ways. Flood resilience or heat island, for example, can be mitigated within the right of way. We can develop better systems for waste management or provide public drinking fountains to reduce plastic waste. And we can rethink the way we deal with deliveries – which will continue to increase – when we shift our view of the street. All of these moves will require us to change the way we allocate space. Our practice at Stantec has done a lot of work envisioning the way our streets could look in a pre-pandemic context. The vision is not only still relevant; it is even more urgent. Street section diagram The idea is to reclaim space from vehicular storage and superfluous travel lanes to accommodate a range of other uses: wider sidewalks, protected micromobility lanes, green stormwater infrastructure and plentiful trees, and a variety of curbside amenities such as bike or scooter parking, pickup/drop off zones, and loading zones. The diagrams show a long-term vision for the future, but we can start small through rapid implementation strategies to bring more fair and safe streets to our city now. Temporary barriers and paint can quickly reallocate space, and popup parks, planters, and other amenities could be included. Business Improvement Districts or local businesses could participate as well, allowing New Yorkers to peek into the future to more permanent solutions. Recovery may be long, and our city is unlikely to look and feel like it did pre-COVID, but with every disruption comes great opportunity to shape our city for the better. Communities are fundamental. Whether around the corner or across the globe, they provide a foundation, a sense of place and of belonging. Stantec cares about the communities we serve—because they’re our communities too.

Kevin Alexander ▷ Inside Out: A Case Study for Improving City Streets Posted on September 4, 2020 We believe that the urgent measures we take now to protect our community’s health should be envisioned with an eye toward improving the livability of our city once the emergency is over. We propose to select streets central to communities that are underserved by the public park system and create a series of green spaces which will serve to improve the quality of life both now and later. While public life is impacted by the Coronavirus, the parks will create new spaces for safer, outdoor gathering and facilitate social distancing solutions for adjacent small businesses–like covered seating for restaurants or socially distanced food bank distribution. Once the emergency has abated, the parks will continue to demonstrate how strategically expanding space for pedestrians, cyclists, and parks in the city can create safer, healthier, greener neighborhoods. We selected Graham Ave in Brooklyn between Broadway and Maujer Streets as a model street for this intervention. Serving as an economic hub for East Williamsburg, Graham links three major NYCHA developments with Woodhull Hospital and Lyons Community School to the Southern and Northern extents. NYCHA and Parks Departments green spaces are nearby but are wholly inadequate for the density of people represented in this subsection of Williamsburg. The addition of nearly 14 blocks of flexible green space would be a boon to the personal and economic health of the community while providing a link between existing public services and programs. While the Coronavirus has wreaked havoc on our urban community, it could also unlock a new attitude toward how the city’s parks can serve a neighborhood. Instead of traveling to visit natural outdoor settings, those settings could be dispersed throughout the urban blocks, breathing new life into the grid for the long term health of our city.

Reopening K-12 Schools After COVID-19 Posted on September 4, 2020 A Planning Strategy to Guide Implementation MS 114 Exterior 92nd Street Entrance Is there a way to safely reopen more than 1,800 K-12 schools in New York City in a responsible way to educate over 1.1 million students? Reopening will require a reliable screening and testing system to evaluate teachers and children daily. Ideally there would be a screening and testing facility at every school, call it front porch healthcare. Mitchell Giurgola has been exploring an actionable plan to scale “front porch” healthcare to serve every school in NYC and has developed a strategy and physical plan that will allow NYC agencies to implement a robust K-12 school community-based screening and testing program. This proposal is intended to provide a nimble analytic tool to site facilities and an adaptable infrastructure for health care providers working in partnership with the Department of Education. Mobility will be critical not only to overcome the challenges of Covid-19, but also to prepare for the upcoming flu season, the next unforeseen global health crisis, and simply to monitor children’s general health with meaningful frequency. Map of New York City’s public school’s proximity to health care facilities. By studying the existing network of the Health + Hospitals Corporation, the Department of Health and other municipal-funded providers, the plan highlights ‘hospital deserts’ where pop-up healthcare installations will be needed. Using GIS mapping technology and data analysis, every school in the five boroughs has been geo-located in its school district. Hospitals, public health centers, and clinics managed by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, Department of Health and community-based non-profits have been flagged, as have school-based medical clinics. By overlaying existing healthcare facilities onto the Department of Education’s 1,800 schools, the mapping study identifies underserved areas, and helps to pinpoint school clusters and potential sites that merit pop-up satellite health centers. Mitchell Giurgola’s proposed three Tiers to ensure NYC schools meet CDC reopening guidelines. The analysis acknowledges the involvement of more than a few agencies who must coordinate their efforts: the Governor, the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services, the Department of Health, the Department of Education, the DOE school based clinics, and Health and Hospitals Corporation. For the purposes of the study and proposal, the assumption is that a coordinated effort among the agencies will be in place. Any less, as we have witnessed at the Federal level, will severely limit the chances for success. To meet the CDC reopening guidelines, every school in NYC will need a designated spot for screening, testing and healthcare outside of the school building surrounded by fresh air and ease of social distancing. Mitchell Giurgola has identified three possible solutions to respond to this need. The first solution, Tier 1, involves utilizing a school’s existing playground as an outdoor, sheltered zone for screening and testing before students and staff enter the building. Given the density of NYC’s urban landscape, however, a more realistic and cost-efficient planning concept is to identify neighboring schools that are sufficiently close to share a satellite facility (Tier 2). By scaling the ‘front porch’ concept, this solution allows a single screening center to serve a cluster of schools on larger unencumbered sites. These satellite health centers should be located within a 15-20-minute walking radius from a cluster of schools. The third solution involves utilizing adjacent public open space (i.e. parking lots, parks, etc.) to expand school-based health care services. A representative school district, District 23 in Central Brooklyn, illustrates the planning process to identify clusters and solutions. Proposed plan for satellite facilities to serve clusters of schools. An aerial survey of the fabric of the neighborhoods reveals potential sites for satellites to serve a cluster of schools. For example, in District 23 there is a cluster of five schools in proximity to PS 284. To reduce the number of individual screening pop-ups, the District managers could decide to develop a satellite facility to serve both PS 284 and the other 4 schools within a walking distance of 15-20 minutes, a cluster. In District 23, several schools are isolated in relatively remote locations, which is commonly the case. In these cases, a singular front porch would be appropriate as illustrated in the example below. Front porch plan for isolated schools. To know what should be provided in a satellite health center, Mitchell Giurgola reviewed the NYCSCA design standard for school-based clinics of which there are 387. Conversely, there are approximately 1,400 schools little more than an office for a school nurse and possibly an examining room and supplies. A test program was developed based on the SCA 750 NSF school-based medical clinic ramped up to accommodate pandemic-related screening and testing, an isolation room and basic lab. The footprint of the temporary clinic grew considerably to provide social distancing, minimal interaction among people and ample natural ventilation. Test program developed based on the SCA 750 NSF school-based medical clinic to accommodate pandemic-related screening and testing. The concept for the design of appropriate temporary and mobile structures is founded on the principle “don’t try to reinvent the wheel”. A brief survey of the industry shows many off-the-shelf rugged, versatile, energy-efficient portable buildings. They are becoming easily available to be purchased off the shelf or leased. Aside from its benefits to Covid-related screening and testing, facilities like this could become a great benefit to local communities by providing access to a broad range of health services. Utilizing GIS mapping allows agencies to process complicated challenges concerning access into straightforward solutions. Merging healthcare and learning at primary and secondary schools will have enormous benefits for civic life. Schools will have added importance as anchors to all people in their neighborhoods. Many families who have had no access to healthcare will now have it daily. Mitchell Giurgola is a New York-based architecture firm that is committed to building with perspective and purpose.

Plummeting birth rates, a strong economy, and the skyrocketing cost of education were the main culprits. In response, many of these institutions revised their missions, aiming to become more than a vehicle for simply delivering education. Campuses evolved into research centers, tech incubators, athletic powerhouses, corporate training grounds, and arts and entertainment destinations. But now, with the pandemic disrupting on-campus activities, creating an even more uncertain future, colleges and universities risk the bottom falling out once again. With no or few students on campus, there is a clear need to evolve missions even further. For institutions of higher education, a successful pandemic recovery may depend on their ability to retool themselves into large-scale community resource centers. Institutional leaders have the resources at hand to provide critical counseling and training services to their surrounding communities, to open up their facilities as workspaces and childcare centers, and to activate their campuses as spaces for public wellness and recreation – filling critical gaps in municipal services in the process. Why College Campus’ Matter As with many large institutions, colleges and universities are quite literally invested in their communities – often to a greater degree than even the federal government — and vice versa. New York City, for example, is home to over 100 higher education institutions employing nearly 70,000 people, supporting local businesses, providing health care and research centers, community leadership, and a vast array public open spaces and programs. Across the country, these institutions are critical employers and service providers, and they in turn depend on a healthy local workforce in order for their own operations to function. When it comes to ensuring the health and wellbeing of local or regional populations, colleges and universities also hold a tremendous number of highly tangible resources within their campuses. Many of these are physical: With partial- or fully distant learning and dipping enrollments a growing trend, they have excess facility space that is well suited for flexible co-working or expanded child support and daycare services; they are also already equipped with concentrated outdoor spaces and social areas appropriate for social distancing, an urban design imperative and also a challenge for many communities, especially in urban areas. To use New York as an example, in the context of the pandemic: There are dozens of institutions – with athletic fields, green space, etc. – in disadvantaged and disproportionately affected communities where accessible public space is otherwise limited. As cornerstones of their surrounding communities, college and university campuses also represent readily identifiable sites that can be activated for important services – creating an ecosystem of daily needs that people will search for, all in one (relatively) geographically bound location. These institutions already have expertise well suited to assist the local population in a failing economy – continuing education, career services, small business expertise, community affairs, and more. In adapting and opening these services to the broader community, colleges and universities can also use their campuses to alleviate burdens that might otherwise come with accessing services in disparate locations: Someone who needs tax help could drop a child off at a daycare facility just minutes away, for instance, and then take advantage of a plaza or other open space afterwards for relaxation. How college campuses can be retooled It is clear that colleges and universities have the potential to offer their resources in a time of need to help maintain or improve quality of life and elevate economic opportunities for area residents. What forms might this take? As noted, above, there is significant opportunity in the notion of on-campus community workspaces. If businesses continue to rely on work from home models in the immediate, midterm, and longer-term post-Covid world, people will increasingly seek work-friendly “third places” that are close to home, close to their kids’ school, close to open space, amenity rich, and populated by other humans. With a potential increase in hybrid K-12 school models testing the limits of flexible scheduling when schools reopen, it seems likely that the spatial nature of many college and university campuses – physically embedded within their communities — will serve this need well. Similarly, campus facilities are set up as advanced learning environments — with media rooms, cutting-edge IT systems and other infrastructure – that makes them ideally equipped to handle all different kinds of work. There is also potential for on-campus workspaces to receive funding through corporate sponsorship by companies looking to drastically downsize their own footprints. Barclays and Google have stated such, and corporate sponsorship on campuses was a growing trend well before the pandemic. In addition to co-working-style services, there are also opportunities for colleges and opportunities to leverage existing resources and provide expert support for individuals and small businesses. The skills needed to help a graduate student launch a business are similar to those that can help an established local business get back on its feet during this pandemic recovery. This is not a new phenomenon: The business school at Drury University in St. Louis, where Cooper Robertson recently developed a campus master plan, has long provided free tax filing support for the surrounding community. But now, the need for these services will expand dramatically. As PPP loans expire and as local businesses need more personal attention and support — beyond just cash to stay afloat — college and university experts are in a unique position to help. Partially this is because all levels of government are overwhelmed and unequipped. It is also because colleges and universities can provide services in a centralized location, and have an on-the-ground perspective and understanding of the unique needs of a particular neighborhood, municipality, or region. There are already good examples of institutions creatively combining continuing education, career services, small-business expertise and community affairs to support local businesses – for instance, the University of Wisconsin’s Small Business Development Center. In terms of workforce preparedness, colleges and universities also have much to offer in the pandemic recovery period. If a major infrastructure plan is to be enacted in the next several years, as many national leaders have suggested, colleges and universities are the largest providers of continuing education, a critical asset in retooling the country’s workforce for the next new deal. For decades, in fact, these institutions have been where private industry turns for advanced manufacturing and workforce education training. Many institutions already have industry partnerships that may prove essential to economic recovery – for instance, community college campuses nationwide hold custom-built, advanced manufacturing equipment, donated by companies who partner with campus administrators to shape curriculums and create a workforce pipeline. Any new large-scale investment in infrastructure or manufacturing is likely to activate these campus facilities and services to an even greater degree, opening up opportunities for local or regional residents to receive new training and to learn important new skills. And, of course, college and university campuses can also become critical centers for community wellness and recreation. Childcare facilities, for example, already exist on most campuses as an important resource for students, faculty, and staff alike. With many daycare and childcare centers closed down in the wake of the pandemic, there is a clear opportunity for colleges and universities to expand these services. One path might be to leverage early childhood education grants, available through many state governments. In terms of recreation, college and university campuses are not only places to walk, run, and bike, but they are often local resource centers for regional recreation — offering programs, public health guidance, equipment rentals, and training. Community needs for these offerings will only expand in the near-term future, as people continue to seek safe places to be outdoors and be outside. In this time of critical need for institutions and the public alike, the creation of strong and healthy communities is very much in the interest of both town and gown. As major local and regional players with extensive physical resources, it is vital for colleges and universities to think creatively, and find ways to offer resources to populations beyond their student bodies – as a social necessity, and also to ensure their own survival. The relationship between institutions of higher education and their communities-at-large has always been deeply symbiotic; now is the time to build on this interconnection and foster resilience with meaningful partnerships and positive actions."

Creating a New Standard for Community Engagement Posted on September 4, 2020 Post-pandemic recovery offers an opportunity to reimagine what community engagement can be. Now is the time for cities, developers, and designers to implement far-reaching, culturally literate outreach strategies that connect with residents who tend to be left out of the design process. Creating and experimenting with a varied set of outreach strategies that are designed to meaningfully engage all groups impacted by a project will build trust now, create a playbook for future innovation, signify an essential first step toward interventions that build parity across neighborhoods, and ultimately shape more equitable cities. Understand your goals The core goal of any community engagement initiative should be to create an exchange of information and ideas between project leaders and those directly and indirectly impacted by the project. However, this will mean something different at each phase of a project. Early on, engagement may mean gathering community input and questioning assumptions about needs, while later outreach may involve focus groups or interactive engagements that educate impacted groups about a proposal. Establishing the goal of any outreach effort early on will increase the impact of your efforts and will help you target participants in an inclusive and thoughtful way. Learn about your stakeholders Who is impacted by your work and what are the barriers they face that would limit their ability to participate? What are the cultural norms and expectations that may affect the reception of your outreach and project among those it impacts? How can you design outreach that encourages responses to complex questions? Understanding these points will help you establish the essential components of your outreach, such as the activities you rely on, the format, the languages you employ, and performance targets. Asking these questions will also ensure that you are creating an equitable outreach plan that meets the needs of the community and the city at large. Explore alternative tools Community engagement can be so much more than a public meeting and comment period, and it has to be in this unprecedented time. Interactive engagements increase opportunities for reflection and feedback and should be considered essential tools in any engagement design. When used in a mindful and accessible way, virtual tools can engage community members in new ways and have the added benefit of increasing the reach of your campaign. Analyze your reach As you roll out your outreach campaign, it is essential that you collect and analyze data on the reach of your engagement. Maybe your translations are not grammatically correct or are in the wrong dialect for many of your stakeholders, or your meeting times conflict with prevalent religious practices in the neighborhood. Analyzing data collected as you move through your outreach will allow you to recognize problem areas, experiment with the tools you are using, and work out fixes that meet the needs of those impacted by your project. It will also help you stay on track for meeting your goals. Be flexible Your outreach should be designed to be able to accommodate stakeholders to make them comfortable and heard no matter the situation. Flexibility is essential to an equitable outreach plan at every step of the way.

Citizen / Designer: Activating the Individual in Urban Space Posted on September 4, 2020 What is the role of the individual in the design of urban space? Has the ever-expanding nexus of profit-driven development, foreign investment, rezoning and gentrification rendered the individual effectively helpless- a bystander in a much larger game of real estate speculation and inequality? Or, are contemporary urban realities simply milestones in a broader historical continuum of urban development? And, is it possible that creative new modes of participation fueled by coronavirus, via teleconferencing, social media, and crowd sourcing, provide the individual with radical new opportunities for creation, intervention, occupation and resistance in the urban context. What will become of “City Life After Coronavirus?” Citizens will decide. We imagine a city wide public participatory effort, called “Citizen/Designer.” A series of open conversations to explore both the possibilities and limitations faced by individuals who wish to contribute to the design of their cities post coronavirus. The series will bring together engaged citizens with practitioners, policy makers, community leaders and activists across the fields of planning, real estate, art and design in discussions that reflect on the new realities foisted upon the city by the coronavirus pandemic. In a context of inclusivity and exploration, the conversations will begin to imagine new dynamics in which individuals play an active role in the reshaping of New York City in the wake of coronavirus We gathered the community in a series of workshops centralized in energy, resilience and future plans to restructure the neighborhood. With so many pressing civic needs playing out in the streets and the news today, now is the right time for a call to action to engage citizens. Marvel Architects brings many lessons from our past work in engagement after a community crisis. For example, after the category 5 Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, we formed Resilient Power Puerto Rico to respond to the immediate and long term sustainable energy needs of the people. the project sought to bring resilience to cities and communities by quickly offering photovoltaic (PV) energy systems and battery storage.  These solar microgrids were created through donations of materials and work and developed by a group of collaborators in New York and Puerto Rico. We targeted common spaces such as community centers to create distributed energy storage systems that serve a wide range of people. We generated and leveraged a network of committed collaborators to strengthen communities’ capacities to assess and address their critical needs. We went to where the people were, we listened carefully through many community events, then helped build local access to knowledge, tools, and resources for sustainable and equitable community development. We discovered that by fostering the continuity of critical built and social infrastructure systems, we could leverage the power of community to forge concrete positive changes. This ongoing outreach effort has to date yielded 35+ new solar power community hubs in the underserved communities throughout Puerto Rico, created a robust on-line platform called the “tool-kit”, and is active in creating legislative changes to promote the use of affordable renewable energy. Social interaction and democratic participation are especially critical in a time where so many of us are self isolating in quarantine. Moving forward into the recovery period, many people will continue to work largely remotely, some never to return to the city. So we need new methods of interaction, that are equitable and accessible to all – those physically present and those digitally present. New technologies can facilitate this interaction and even better advance citizen engagement as they become more accessible, seamless, and human. Such tools include computer vision, conversational voice, auditory analytics, haptic sensors, advanced augmented reality, and virtual reality, which will expand the audience, offer personalized targeted updates, and better convey environmental context cues of complex and nuanced human behaviors like gestures and gazes. The steps of the process are time honored. First a select group of practitioners, policy makers, and community leaders are to develop a series broad but provocative topics related to the new urban planning issues necessitated by coronavirus. How do we best share competing interests of the street? What makes public space democratic? How are changing populations affecting neighborhood identity? What can commercial businesses do to ensure viability and safety? Second, there will be a broad outreach program, which leverages many possible platforms (digital, print, postings, etc.), targets individuals and groups, and solicits their assistance to expand further. Third, hold a series of civic engagement opportunities by topic which may take the form of panel discussions, town hall forums, charettes, field walks, and more. All along the process will make personal connections, foster community, build coalitions, develop strategies, and strengthen knowledge. Finally, synthesize findings and results into a series of goals and objectives, implement action. Working in concert, the time honored civic processes and new high tech digital platforms will transform the way we engage each other. The result can be transformative – a city shaped by and for its citizens, with equity and inclusion.

Using the Storefront to Foster Community Engagement Posted on September 4, 2020 How can vacant storefronts become places and tools that allow our communities to heal? How can principles of community building and economic development fill the gap and serve as a catalyst for local connections? Over the last decade, the increasing numbers of vacant storefronts have been changing the landscape of our neighborhoods. The financial ripple effects of the pandemic will speed up this trend. These vacancies are affecting the liveliness of our neighborhoods and their economic vitality, disproportionately affecting those already at a disadvantage based on their race, culture, and economic status. Unlocked has been conceived as an Urban Design experiment. One that will select and activate strategic storefronts, introducing programming for the community by the community. It will create opportunities for healing, learning, networking, and innovation. The site selection is critical for the impact of the activation. The ideal space will be in an area with a high vacancy in retail renters. It needs to be in an active community with high numbers of people walking and cycling. Proximity to public transportation is ideal and adjacency to a parking space that can be converted into an outdoor extension would be a great addition for physical distancing. As we navigate this pandemic (and the weather allows) an accessible outdoor extension will allow for additional uses or a waiting area for the indoor space. Both Indoor and outdoor spaces will follow strict occupancy restrictions based on the Department of Buildings (DOB) guidelines. Once the Unlocked storefront is selected, the focus will be to identify and address the needs of the neighborhood. Prioritizing activations that benefit communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic. We will take a human-centered approach from the beginning of the research phase. Members of the community and local partners will be engaged to develop a customized strategy suitable for the unique needs of the community. These conversations will help build trust within the community and facilitate a sense stewardship for the idea. Their collective skills, professional capital, and support will allow for a larger impact. Each site can serve as the front for ever-evolving community needs. Each Unlocked storefront should be able to easily transform during the day to accommodate different needs and functions. Ideas for activations can range from arts and culture events (that can be streamed online), access to information, Covid-19 testing center, other support services, and other educational and/or retail opportunities. Each activation can provide our communities with an improved sense of belonging, an opportunity for dialogue, and a greater opportunity for retail innovation and incubation.

Strengthening of the Hyperlocal Posted on September 4, 2020 [RE]USE [RE]SHAPE [RE]THINK [RE]URBANIZE [RE]SEARCH [RE]ZONE [RE]PROGRAM [RE]CONNECT [RE]CONSIDER [RE]SET COVID-19 has abruptly separated us from our vast geographical infrastructure we had come to rely on. Now confined to walkable distances in our immediate neighborhoods, communities are forced to return to simpler times when cities were a collection of villages, but all too often without the local businesses and civic infrastructure required for them to be sustainable. Like pieces of a puzzle gone missing over the years, so have these district- focused elements; independent grocery stores, health clinics, museums, schools, small businesses, and safe places to socialize. The pandemic has refocused what we consider to be our community by suddenly narrowing the radius of available resources. Urbanists previously identified this trend, but it took the drastic nature of a pandemic to clearly illustrate how unbalanced modern metropolitan life has become. To ensure the successful growth for all inhabitants of the city, the local village – the hyperlocal, must be resurrected. It is not simply identifying the missing pieces but re-crafting them to create livable neighborhoods. Through a shift in mindset at all levels – government, community, enterprise – coupled with the collaboration of planners and architects, we can take a step back to envision a complete puzzle with its interlocking parts of connected communities that re-create a robust, well balanced and sustainable city. Within the city – not to the city As NYC’s population continues to grow, a neighborhood’s walkability and capacity to provide for its residents must be prioritized in order to minimize the strain on our citywide infrastructure systems. Self-sustaining neighborhoods reinforce residents’ sense of belonging, and make their communities safer and stronger. Could the success of our city be found in the strengthening of the hyper local? Not more but better Rather than only fortifying existing citywide systems, brazen development, or expanding city sprawl, how might reworking a neighborhood’s fabric, in collaboration with residents, create a resilient and vibrant city? We are told more trains will solve the subways, but what if we reduce the need for them, by providing better opportunities for learning, employment, and leisure in communities where people live? By supporting underdeveloped infrastructure in neighborhoods can we ensure their health and sustainable growth into the future? We should shift our focus to building our social infrastructure. Toward equilibrium Could essential infrastructure that sustains neighborhoods, such as clinics, schools, and small businesses, serve the local walkable community to sustain the local economy while also being part of the greater city-wide network? Why this – Why now? COVID-19 has brought a world-wide level reset that has shown how unbalanced modern metropolitan life had become. It has forced us to re-evaluate how the hyper-local needs to be re-thought, re-used, re-zoned, re-connected, and re-considered. What exists is not new. What is new – is the opportunity to act (now). We cannot return to what was previously deemed “normal.” Locally-based social networks have played a vital role during this pandemic, and with the proper re-set, they can continue to play a leading role towards creating a more socially, economically, and environmentally resilient New York City. Hyperlocal; The City REimagined The hyperlocal refocuses on the well-being of the local neighborhood by relocating its basic needs within walkable distances. With this as its foundation it also advocates that essentials, meaning uses that empower and enrich the individual and collective, are integral to these neighborhoods. Through this approach it ensures communities are both self-sufficient and part of a larger city-wide network that is socially, culturally, and economically resilient. In strengthening this network of human centered streets and cross-programmed uses it becomes connected, alive, and safe. The common thread within the network of hyperlocal neighborhoods is the community hub which acts as the catalyst to neighborhood engagement by providing the space to learn, gather, and promote change – to meet the civic and cultural demands of today. The hyperlocal offers equity of choice of how we live within our city. Now is the time to REshape, REconnect, and REimagine the local. the hyperlocal is human centered the hyperlocal is walkable and bikeable the hyperlocal fulfills both basic and essential needs the hyperlocal is small-scale cross-programming the hyperlocal is sustainable and resilient the hyperlocal is socially equitable Andrea Steele Architecture (ASA) is dedicated to accessing the humanity inherent in the design process. We see architecture as the medium through which we define our shared experience and our practice as a catalyst for cultural advancement. Every project we undertake, from a modest private residence to a large-scale civic complex, is rooted in the idea of building a global community.

Nine Reciprocities: Reimagining the Power of the Block Posted on September 4, 2020 An architectural, financial, environmental, and social model for living block-by-block http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/Nine_Reciprocities_by_Galen_Pardee__Lindsey_Wikstrom.mp4 Block 162, Chinatown, NY 2021 Nine Reciprocities explores the ways in which forms of dense, urban living can be adapted and redirected towards collective futures and ecologically equitable structures for the future. Nine Reciprocities proposes an architectural, financial, environmental, low-carbon, and social recipe for Block 162, a mixed-use group of existing buildings in New York City’s Chinatown. By maximizing the block’s Floor Area Ratio (FAR), the community of workers, retirees, experts, and visitors inhabiting the block can expand their space in a cross-laminated timber “overbuild”, utilizing existing foundations and footings to create new social spaces, workshops, daycare, parkland, and home offices. Construction and demolition material is recycled within the block as partitions are removed, finishes replaced, and overbuilds expanded: a system of trombe-wall gardens grows over time, making oxygen, and sequestering carbon. Collective self-government, Tenant-in-Common financing, and sweat equity systems coordinate labor, services, and ownership. A system of trade apprenticeship builds knowledge within the block, without bias toward digital or physical work, transferring expertise through generations. COVID-19 has exposed critical oversights in our existing understanding of social contracts and the value of labor, highlighting the need to jump-start and strengthen these social ties to combat future epidemics, economic downturns, and approaching ravages of climate change. Beyond responding to the public health problems posed by the structures of pandemic and quarantine, Nine Reciprocities looks towards emerging and intensifying issues of urban social equality and environmental collapse, building a reciprocal framework between humans, societies, materials, and the environment.

Focusing on Recovery at the Neighborhood Scale Posted on September 4, 2020 At HLW, we feel that a unique opportunity exists to acknowledge and mitigate some key societal inequities in many New York City neighborhoods through community-based, decentralized urban design strategies. In the midst of a global pandemic that has impacted New York City deeply and irrevocably, the daily experience of communities that were already in a perpetual state of crisis pre-Covid has been made exponentially worse. The structural issues that support this crisis-state are the focus of our proposition. We propose that City Life After Coronavirus should be imagined comprehensively, audaciously and equitably. We see this approach applied at three scales: Small, Medium and Large. From light-touch tactical interventions that people directly engage, to formally-coordinated neighborhood-wide planning, which provides access to distributed public services and greater political self-determination, each of these proposed solutions is to be seen as part of a comprehensive network for renewal. Large Scale The large-scale response will capitalize on the more positive effects of post-pandemic nationalism, reduced global dependency and decentralization. Urban communities, particularly communities in crisis, will be better places to live through more self-sufficient networks of services, enterprise, and education. Neighborhood infrastructures of sustainable food production, energy and waste management systems, and responsive transportation networks, combined with more direct political representation, will result in the firmer foundations on which healthy communities are based. The current crisis further reveals the inequalities of our cities and its infrastructure. The concentration of high emission and high pollution industries in low income neighborhoods reduces local air quality and adds yet another infectious disease risk factor that raises the mortality rate and lowers life expectancy of those facing systemic poverty. Large scale responses will push for equitable distribution of environmental initiatives throughout our cities so that nobody has to live with increased health risks just because of their zip code of residence. This transition away from the megalopolis city-state to the federation of neighborhoods requires a multidisciplinary (architecture, planning, engineering, art, public health, etc) response that embodies the re-democratization of public space, including parks, streets, and squares. The Autonomous Neighborhood Neighborhood institutions such as community forums, schools, markets, and cultural facilities will be landmarks that require new architectural typologies. For example, instead of borough-based jails, why not develop an integrated network of restorative justice services? Instead of food deserts, why not create centralized markets supplied by infrastructure-scaled urban farms and community gardens? Instead of large institutional-scale hospitals, why not a more robust network of community run wellness centers integrated at the threshold of residential and commercial districts that advance public health missions during normal times, which also have the capacity to scale into acute care centers during times of crisis? Public spaces, enhanced by humanistic design approaches and embedded technology (based around public service) will be the new live / work / play environments for healthy communities. Medium Scale The medium-scale response supports this notion of more self-reliant neighborhoods through a focus on streets. In a post-pandemic world where interior environments will gradually be transformed into healthier, sustainable, “breathing” spaces, the street is the first refuge. The market street, the promenade, the mews, and the vest-pocket parks have all outlived the world’s greatest cataclysms. These spaces represent millennia of human urban occupation and should be the building blocks for a healthier future. The immediate inclination of many (who could afford to) has been to flee the city. Those remaining have largely stayed indoors under government mandate. The Street Designed for Distance + Density Deployable Neighborhood Testing & Intake Facilities, Project Heroe, HLW Streets have been nearly empty of cars and trucks. Air quality has significantly improved, and the sounds of birds have replaced traffic in pandemic-ravaged cities. Evening gratitude celebrations of healthcare and services workers have filled our streets every day with music, applause, and the sounds of resiliency. Will post-pandemic cities become choked with traffic once life returns to “normal” and former urbanites drive in and out every day from the suburbs? This was the case in 1970’s New York, following massive flight from failing urban infrastructures and quality of life. Will these acute changes inspire permanent solutions to our city streets? With time and space on the side of progress, now is the time to accelerate traffic calming and re-pedestrianizing plans that have already been proposed. Small Scale Small-scale responses are the most immediate and deployable now and during the earliest days of post-pandemic life in cities. It involves providing fast, reliable healthcare and health security to all communities, but particularly to communities in crisis. It is realized at the street, on street corners and spaces accessible by all. The current urban healthcare infrastructure tends to be centralized and focused around areas of concentrated wealth and resources. What if all communities had access to convenient, safe, and effective testing and counseling during flu season? How would the spread of coronavirus during the winter of 2020 been affected by the availability of these kinds of services? We believe that the implementation of small-scale interventions that have large-scale impacts results in immediate and effective progress toward a larger vision of decentralized and self-sufficient communities serving all New Yorkers. We envision a system of lightweight, deployable, and inviting structures with a kit of parts that will be quickly produced and deployed throughout the community within the next six months. These testing and counseling facilities could be mobile (truck-based), stationary pods, or embedded within existing institutions, such as schools or libraries. They could be all three of these, utilizing a similar set of components. The physical facilities will be augmented by a digital backbone providing information and direct access to hospitals and healthcare professionals. As the pandemic moves from urban centers to rural hot spots, these facilities could be moved to where they are most urgently needed. As the weather warms and as more people venture outside, street level commerce will gradually proliferate. To maintain safe social distancing while we continue to live with the virus in our presence, we see an opportunity to open up city businesses onto the sidewalks and possibly into newly reclaimed street space. We envision a semi-permanent model of street-based commerce that mirrors the various holiday markets that abound major public parks like Union Square and Bryant Park during the end-of-year holiday season. Fresh outdoor air has natural benefits over some indoor air systems. In the near term, outdoor shopping may be safer than venturing indoors, so why not invest in a kitof-parts for small and medium-sized businesses to help them bring their commerce to the streets and reactivate street life in a potentially long lasting way? Our mission at HLW is to question the norm, design with passion, and build what’s next. We were established in 1885 and have continuously evolved to stay at the forefront of architecture and design. From designing the first dedicated telephone building in New York City to our current work with mega tech companies, HLW has a legacy of combining elegant aesthetics with innovative technologies. Rachel Meltzer ▷ Re-Activating the Corner Store Posted on September 4, 2020 The future of retail and storefront services in cities is in question—it has been for some time. Long before COVID-19, it was urban flight to the suburbs (and their malls); more recently it’s been the onslaught of e-commerce. The current pandemic combines the threats of both of these disruptions: risks (both real and perceived) of traversing the streets and the allure and convenience of online commerce options. Neighborhood retail services have always been a different animal than downtown commercial corridors. In fact, before the pandemic, there was evidence that urban residents were increasingly relying on nearby neighborhood amenities. And this was a time, not long ago, when people easily moved around the city for work and leisure. But now, and for the foreseeable future, people will be tethered to their neighborhoods unlike anytime in recent history. Mobility across the city will slow down—more people will be working remotely and travel will be skewed towards walking, cycling or, for those with access to cars, driving. One’s local neighborhood will be logistically easy and physically safe. On a more visceral level, the neighborhood is also familiar. Routines of accessing services, knowing how to safely navigate spaces, and seeing the same set of faces all provide some level of security as we cautiously emerge from our quarantines. We will be testing in real time whether distance matters—the advantage of proximity that cities have always had, but that has been chipped away as remote technologies have taken hold. We will see more clearly the differences in how people rely on and interact with their neighborhood services. Which neighborhoods have access to essential services, like supermarkets and pharmacies? Which households seamlessly shift to online shopping? Where do essential workers, who have to leave their neighborhoods, live and will retail in those footloose communities be more or less vulnerable? As a believer in the physicality of cities, I remain optimistic that this crisis will lay bare the limits of remote living. My own research has empirically documented the co-dependence of retail and neighborhood vitality, a relationship that is entirely based on physical proximity. People will want to connect, and they will turn outward—and re-engaging with local establishments and services will be part of the recovery. Patronizing neighborhood retail will be both economically revitalizing and psychologically fortifying. Could this be a moment for urban retail? It won’t happen without some concerted effort, on the part of government, communities and the businesses themselves. Time and income have been lost—the disruptions of the past few months will push many small businesses off the tightrope that they have walked for a while. For those that have managed to hang on, either by staying open and adjusting their operations or by accessing financial support to stopgap the losses, they know that the pace of business will not be the rush that they need. We still need financial reinforcements—after any disaster, the biggest losses for storefront businesses, often not covered by any insurance, are due to the interruption in consumers. That loss will continue to need to be remedied for some time. However, businesses also need operational support. Guidance on how to adapt their storefront to minimize health risks. Material support and regulatory flexibility for retrofitting spaces to serve customers safely and to protect their employees. Training on how to leverage online platforms for selling and promoting their goods and services. Help with access to new distributors as supply chains shift. Relief from permitting processes and fines that burden already fragile businesses. Opening up the streets for retail displays and restaurant seating (while eliminating parking spots and discouraging car usage at the same time). These are interventions that should be considered during normal times and that need to be accelerated now. And consumers need to do their part. Supporting neighborhood businesses has always been just as much about community investment as it is about individual convenience. What better time to capitalize on this mentality than during this pandemic, which has been an extended exercise in individual sacrifice and community preservation. Instead of going online to purchase that shampoo or carton of milk, walk down the block and support your local store. And if they don’t have what you need, tell them instead of using the easy online route. If you don’t feel safe patronizing their establishment, tell them why. This will need to be a collective effort, as the businesses cannot survive without our support, and our communities are worse off without their services. Hopefully our investments now will sustain the health of our neighborhoods well beyond the threat of COVID-19.

Building a Resilient New York City Posted on September 4, 2020 If the coronavirus kills globalization, what will replace it? We see a new age of regional metropolitanism dawning. The regions around Rome, Paris, Boston and Beijing have been experiencing greater and faster population increases than the traditional urban cores. Government policy in these regions has rebalanced itself to account for a new emerging territorial network of work, live, play and make NYC needs to follow suit. We think that the planning and design of regional metropolitan areas, such as that of NYC and its hinterlands, needs to be done in a much more rigorous way. The call to repatriate offshoring will meet the need to protect the natural assets of the countryside. Climate change will reveal the links between the surrounding regional environment and the metabolic demands of a neighborhood on water, waste and energy. Planners will have to understand networking arrangements better in order to encourage the right scales of occupation, growth and openness. Politics will adapt to the realities of settlement patterns at different scales of dispersion and intensity. We believe that design can serve as an effective tool to create new regional networks for cities like NYC so that we do more than just return to normal and instead build robust and resilient regions in the wake of the coronavirus. Trends Affecting NYC Population Dispersal Population dispersal towards urban peripheries and rural hinterlands will intensify in a post-pandemic age. Reshoring Reshoring creates opportunities for rural synergies between agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. @Homing Housing and technology will converge creating a new work-live balance in the emerging rural metropolis. Agri-Movement Demand for locally grown food will require the strengthening of supply chains fortified with real-time data analysis. Strategies for New York City Leverage Geographical Networks: Design networks that take advantage of the differences in scale between small, medium and large communities by fortifying supply chains, strengthening infrastructural links and creating commercial crossroads. Assert Regional Character: Capture the value of NY region’s social, cultural and natural assets through a strategy of monetized preservation. Expand & Diversify Local Economies: Increase value of local commodities through targeted R&D investments that build technical training opportunities & increase interaction between adjacent industries, a simple example is the coconut tree in the tropics. What are the opportunities for New York and regions around?

We saw insecurities related to food scarcity, travel standstills and logistics. A recent COVID Impact Survey conducted by the Brookings institute indicates that more than one in every five households is food insecure in the United States. New York City is the hardest hit part of the country, where 1 in every 4 New Yorkers were food insecure and addressing food insecurity was a central part to the pandemic response (Figure 1). Drone footages show endless lines of those waiting to pick up food from pantries or even grocery stores, bringing to light the cracks in the food system (Figure 2). Figure 1 – Residents wait in a line outside a food pantry in Brooklyn during the COVID 19 pandemic. Due to high levels of unemployment, lines at the daily food pantry have been growing longer. Figure 2 – In this April 1, 2020, photo, cars line up at a drive-thru food pantry at Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Mich. The National Guard helped distribute the food at the site, which was run by Feeding America West Michigan. The pantry is one of many set up after the coronavirus arrived in Michigan. (Neil Blake/The Grand Rapids Press via AP) It was also especially apparent in developing countries like India, which implemented Stage-4 lockdowns resulting in a complete pause in essential supply chains underscored by hoarding, panic-buying and mass migrations. These situations throughout the world left those with lower incomes the most vulnerable during the pandemic – they lost their only source of income and lacked fundamental supplies – especially food (Figure 3). Figure 3 – The underserved waiting in lines for packaged food amid COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining social distance This proposal aims to empower underprivileged communities in Indian cities by designing a system of self-sustainable micro-plantations within households — resulting in improved food security, better nutrition and greater economic stability. Context It is estimated that two-thirds of the Indian population will be living in cities by 2050, most of them below poverty lines. Following the 2008 recession and subsequent inflation, the urban poor were living on daily-wages, and spending 80% of their income on food, yet were chronically hungry. They were suffering from food insecurity and malnutrition – a situation laid bare by Covid-19. While there are numerous organizations supporting temporary recoveries, ‘Microcosm’ sees the opportunity of a resilient self-sustaining strategy that creates immunity against future shocks and provides growth opportunities. Microcosm aims to create self-sustainable micro-farming communities through the contextual and spatial design of plantations, development of farming kits, education, and outreach of farming techniques, and the creation of a barter support-system among the residents of the community. Description and Implementation Figure 4 – Implementation process, and project timeline, illustrating the step by step scheme along with collaborators involved To understand the context and establish the goals for a pilot intervention, it is important to undertake a survey and analyze existing socio-economic conditions and disaster management strategies (Figure 4). Developing collaborations with existing initiatives and not-for-profit organizations could help establish connection with these low income neighborhoods. A number of organizations in the five boroughs have been assisting communities to fight food shortage through community gardens and food pantries (Figure 5 and 6). This outreach to the community can play a pivotal role in establishing an initiative like Microcosm. Figure 5 – Children of the Light Food Pantry arranges groceries for residents in New York City.Photo: José A. Alvarado Jr. for The Intercept Figure 6 – NYC’S Battery Urban Farm project spans one acre as the largest educational farm in Manhattan.Photo: United States Department of Agriculture Website The first step would be to establish sustainable subsistence-farming strategies and kits through spatial analysis, research and parametric prototyping and using the site specific parameters derived from the surveys and site study. One of the larger challenges faced during the proposal if this initiative would be a backlash from the local community —– It would be highly beneficial to collaborate with field experts and local members in the region who can be engaged to establish an effective and sustainable middle-ground between organic and commercial farming strategies, economically viable for the community. Sustainable practices could involve composting for manure generation or research of natural detergents for water recycling and hydroponics for space conservation can be implemented. Educating the community about the methods and benefits of growing their own food and creating awareness about its nutritional and economic benefits is a key factor for the adoption of this methodology. This awareness can be spread through community workshops and campaigns. Assistance from experts and urban farming organizations that are already promoting and practicing sustainable urban farming would be required from the time of sowing to reaping the produce of the first crop cycle. This entire process (Figure 4), if documented and published across media with presence in communities of similar standing can help amplify the initiatives outreach and the importance of urban farming among other neighborhoods and communities. This proposal can be envisioned as a reflective experience, portraying the impact of the project on the community, prototype design for public use and its vital role in sustaining the community through other future shocks. The ultimate aim is to inspire individuals, communities and institutions about the advantages of in-situ farming and encourage their transition to growing their own food. Benefits and Future Figure 7 – Design Implication, illustrating the project afterlife and growth into communities, neighborhoods and organizations in the city and other cities. “We’re committed to helping countries…be better prepared when risks materialize, one of them being food security.” – World Bank Apr.2020 Over time, skills acquired during this project would provide a platform for new business opportunities to sell produce at local markets and collaborate with neighboring households to set-up micro-garden systems in exchange for additional income and social capital credits. The proposal has the ability to spark a movement that can instigate a nation-wide slum development, securing permanence to residents in exchange for their services to the city. Health and Cities – Social and Humanitarian Impacts “End hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.” Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger In conclusion, this proposal focuses on empowering excluded and vulnerable groups by introducing a system of self-sustainable urban agriculture based on shared enterprise, creating communities that are resistant to natural and man-made crises, by ensuring fresh produce all year. Apart from reducing starvation, achieving food security, improving nutrition and economic conditions, these micro-gardens also lead to a healthier living environment. Although the demographic and socio-economic conditions of India are very different, food insecurity is a global issue – the proposal engages vulnerable communities and this could be applicable to how New York can create a decentralized and resilient food system."

Making New York in Long Island City Posted on September 4, 2020 Long Island City (LIC) is a diverse, mixed-use neighborhood in western Queens and home to the longest continuously-operating industrial area in the country. Since the early 19th century, LIC has played a key role in the region’s economic development, producing everything from car parts to fortune cookies to award-winning movies. In the last decade, the neighborhood saw major growth in residential and commercial developments after zoning changes, while industrial uses remain and evolve. However, having industrial spaces close to the city center is not a given, and many US cities have lost industry in their core. Industrial businesses support the basic functions of the city and the region, employ workers at every level, and pay sustainable wages. More needs to be done to support urban industrial areas to retain and grow this vital sector so important for a modern city, especially in the post-COVID-19 world. Image Courtesy of LICP LIC’s Industrial Business Zone (IBZ) is home to a wide range of industrial users. IBZs are not zoning designations, but rather programmatic areas throughout New York City that receive direct business assistance and other resources meant to foster industrial growth and preserve manufacturing uses. In part due to these IBZ designations as well as its wealth of buildings suitable for large-scale production, LIC maintained industrial uses during its growth, setting up the neighborhood to respond quickly during a crisis and recover collectively after. COVID-19 makes apparent the importance of preserving industrial uses, but it is far from the only reason to do so. In mid-March, as offices and retailers turned off their lights under the Governor’s stay-at-home order, New York’s essential businesses remained in operation to keep the city running and slow the outbreak. At 7 pm, New Yorkers cheered daily for essential workers and homemade signs in apartment windows thanked doctors, nurses, and grocery store workers. Another group of essential workers, though with less attention, also continued working: those in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. Across the East River from Midtown Manhattan in LIC two manufacturers eagerly offered their help and joined many others to make and distribute essential supplies for the pandemic. By mid-April, Boyce Technologies, the advanced manufacturer of the MTA Help Point kiosks among other products, had pivoted quickly to produce a new, lower cost bridge-ventilator to free up more expensive ventilators for the most critically ill COVID-19 patients. Founded in 2007, Boyce Technologies came to the LIC IBZ in the eastern part of the neighborhood in the last decade. Plaxall, a plastics manufacturer of custom packaging for toys, food, and cosmetics, began producing essential PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) face shields for healthcare workers. Plaxall has been in LIC for over 70 years, is a major property owner in the neighborhood, and is located close to the waterfront. These companies have different stories but a shared interest in innovation—and a shared neighborhood. Image Courtesy of LICP Manufacturing innovative equipment for fighting COVID-19 is just one small piece of the role Plaxall and Boyce play in LIC. Boyce works closely with students and faculty at nearby LaGuardia Community College to provide internships each semester as well as offering tours and hands-on learning opportunities for area high school students. Plaxall is involved with LIC’s arts community and provides the space for Culture Lab LIC, a non-profit arts group that runs the Plaxall Gallery and hosts community programs, performances, and gallery shows. LIC’s diverse mix of large and small businesses are engaged in the community not just in response to today’s crisis, but for the long run. Centrally located urban industrial areas like LIC show that industry is an important and ever-evolving aspect of a city’s mix. Plaxall and Boyce are not unique in their response to the pandemic, but part of an ecosystem of businesses helping through their expertise and facilities: from caterers and food companies like Neuman’s Kitchen and Juice Press who provided food to healthcare workers and those in need, to 3DBio which also produced ventilators and PPE, to clothing companies that made masks and gowns, a neighborhood equipped to make things is a responsive neighborhood. The success of LIC in preserving active manufacturing uses serves as a case study for how industrial areas embedded within mixed-use urban neighborhoods allow for collaboration, quick adaptation of supply chains, and creative solutions, which help the region better withstand and recover from future crisis. They can serve as centers of innovation that give birth to new ideas and solutions to urban problems. Concentrated industry represents not just the creation of everyday essentials but also family-supporting jobs. The average wage of a worker in manufacturing is nearly twice that of a retail worker. Plaxall and Boyce Technologies highlighted above are just two examples of LIC’s industrial and manufacturing sectors that provide jobs at every level, which employ 40% of the workforce in LIC. In imagining city life after COVID-19, other cities should take from New York and LIC’s example to create and support urban industrial areas that have convenient access to transportation, corporate offices, hotels, residential buildings, educational institutions, workforce training programs, and small businesses. LIC’s thriving industrial sector should remind city leaders that industrial uses are the heart of a modern city. Without support, industrial sectors cannot provide the city what it needs. Long Island City Partnership (LICP) is the neighborhood development organization for Long Island City. Our mission is to advocate for economic development that benefits the area’s industrial, commercial, tech, cultural, tourism, and residential sectors. The goal is to attract new businesses to Long Island City (LIC), retain those already here, welcome new residents and visitors, and promote a vibrant and authentic mixed-use community. As the designated Industrial Business Service Provider (IBSP) for Queens West under contract with the NYC Small Business Services, we also help foster true industrial uses in the Industrial Business Zone (IBZ) and create new economic opportunities in LIC.

The Post-Pandemic City is a City for Women: Two Ways to Move Towards a More Equitable City for Caregivers Posted on September 4, 2020 Women on the front lines of the pandemic, at work and at home While it’s becoming clear that men make up a greater share of Covid-19 fatalities, women and people of color continue to lose their jobs in greater numbers due to the economic slowdown. And both health and economic experts are already pointing out long-term negative effects of the pandemic will be felt most acutely by women and girls. These inequities rest on a foundation of longstanding economic and health disparities: women, and especially women of color, lag far behind white men in earnings and accumulated wealth, and on average earn just 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. Women in general and Black women in particular disproportionately hold service and sales sector jobs, which have been slow to return. And they make up almost 70% of workers in low-wage jobs that pay less than $10/hourly, with Black and Latinx women overrepresented in those jobs. Women are more likely to be on the coronavirus front lines in cities. They make up 76% of essential healthcare workers and 73% of government and community-based service workers, and two-thirds of grocery store and fast-food employees. This largely-female workforce risking infection daily to do essential jobs are also more likely to be Black women and women of color, who are already more likely to have a variety of pre-existing or chronic conditions that may put them in a higher coronavirus risk group. For women with childcare or other caretaking responsibilities, the impact has been bleaker still. With schools and many childcare centers closed, the Covid crisis has exacerbated the existing burden of unpaid labor: caretaking and household responsibilities that women have long shouldered disproportionately in the US and worldwide. “Up until the lockdown hit, I was consulting 4 days a week. Now, my goal is to have 4 days per month.” It’s clear that across the socioeconomic spectrum, Covid-19 has forced women’s age-old choice of work or family into the foreground. During a pandemic, this isn’t a theoretical question of “having it all.” Millions of caretakers are facing mental health challenges and long-term financial loss. For many others, it’s a matter of life and death. As a society, we cannot choose to fail women at this critical moment. This crisis can be a turning point, but only if cities step up and take action on meaningful gender equity policies. Of course, urban policy and planning alone can’t undo centuries of systemic inequity. But by creating policies and spaces that meet the needs of women and caretakers who have long carried a greater burden, it can begin to level the playing field.* *We also must begin with a caveat about the enormity of the problem: Covid-19 has permanently changed a generation’s relationship to the workplace. There are many consequences of this mass shift in behavior around work caused by Covid-19 that we won’t focus on here, although they remain central to work and mobility for all, not just caregivers. Issues like broadband access, grid capacity, interior air quality, the financing of the MTA, and public education, not to mention affordable housing. These are major systemic issues that deserve a critical overhaul. However, by looking at the daily movement and work patterns of caregivers, we can target relatively simple, actionable solutions that can make New York City, and all cities, more equitable. Cities for Women Gender-inclusive design is a nascent but growing practice that begins with including more voices and experiences in the planning process. As the urban policy and design professions confront the historical lack of equitable representation in their fields, and worse, how some well-intentioned practices have exacerbated racist harm, a crisis moment like ours provides an opportunity to right these wrongs. In the face of entrenched inequities like the ones many caregivers face, an inflection point is an urgently needed break in the status quo. The female experience of urban space has long been colored by the same inequities that touch every other aspect of life, from the gender pay gap to the threat of sexual violence. But as Curbed recently suggested, the Covid-19 crisis could serve as a tipping point to move us toward a “feminist city.” However, our current crisis is just shining a light on the underlying inequities that make the feminist city such an aspirational paradigm. Caregivers have long navigated urban spaces differently, and have done their best to survive and thrive in spaces not designed for them. The two aspects of urban life we focus on are work and mobility: specifically, the spatial implications of changed patterns of work, and opportunities to reimagine mobility to better serve caregivers and families. Both are fundamental, every-day aspects of urban life that have been completely upended, both spatially and experientially, by the Covid crisis. And both have a long legacy of failing women, particularly caregivers, and particularly women of color and those with lower incomes. By reimagining how our workplaces function spatially, and how our cities facilitate movement, we can restructure some of the power systems inherent in a built environment that has long ignored the needs and erased the experiences of caregivers. In addition to the research cited throughout this article and our own experiences, we draw on the experiences of 62 respondents to an original survey about patterns of work and mobility while being a caregiver in NYC during Covid-19. We disseminated this survey through New York City parent email and social media lists in July of 2020. The “Home Workplace” but Make it Cooperative! With children suddenly at home, the deeply unequal burden of childcare has grown more unequal. Recent research suggests that unpaid childcare work, not sex-based discrimination, may be the key to the gender pay gap. A 2018 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research puts it succinctly: “Even with perfectly equal pay for equal work, there would still be large gender inequality in earnings as equal work is not an option for the majority of women who are faced with the lion’s share of child care responsibilities.” “There is joy in the closeness, but I am so tired.” As many of our survey respondents have experienced, the Covid-19 pandemic has exploded the line between work space, childcare space, and home. As the Washington Post recently put it, “Under various shelter at home orders, every day is Take Your Child to Work Day.” But these lines were already blurring. Enabled by digital tools and platforms, the rise of gig, part-time, and freelance jobs, and more companies offering telework, home-based work has been on the rise for a decade. Covid, of course, accelerated this trend dramatically. A recent MIT study found that of those employed pre-Covid, about half are now working from home, including 35.2% who report they were previously commuting and switched to working from home. “We relocated to a different state to have access to part-time childcare provided by a family member. We still have major gaps we have to cover.” For low and many middle-income families and for women who have otherwise chosen to stay at home with children, the lack of affordable childcare has long been a major barrier to work. Lower-income women have long relied more on their “village,” including intergenerational households, but over time planning has made this more difficult by separating not only land uses, but also intergenerational families or co-housing communities, through zoning. The isolation of many mothers across demographics is an important mental health concern that continues to be physically and socially reinforced. When asked to identify their ideal work situation post-Covid, women who responded to our survey overwhelmingly wanted more flexibility, the ability to continue working from home, extreme reductions in hours in exchange for focused work time, and better local workspace options than before the pandemic. But survey respondents were clear what support they need to make it all work. “I’m constantly distracted, stressed, juggling too much, and worried about long term economic stability.” The caregivers in our survey suggest that they will continue to benefit from working from home to manage family and caregiving obligations; however, they won’t be effective, productive, or satisfied in a scenario where they do not have the support of school and childcare. In addition, many women indicated that flexibility alone wasn’t enough, that they needed control to determine their own schedules, and wanted to be assured that the culture of their workplaces recognized the challenges parents face balancing work and home. For many, though, the social part of work is what makes the work itself bearable. Just as many workplaces shifted to meet the needs of a fully-remote workforce overnight, we should now demand that cities and policymakers support the most vulnerable members of the labor force by helping women in all kinds of jobs to gain more power and control over their hours, schedules, and work locations–as a small step in re-integrating a culture of care into daily life. Cities built to center the experiences and needs of female caregivers must have: A cooperative, affordable model of childcare that is neighborhood-based Safe spaces for children to play, learn, and socialize while their parents work nearby Spatial solutions for a non-traditional work schedule and locations Support for more inclusive neighborhood-based coworking and community space options that explicitly meet the needs of parents and caregivers, including subsidy and access to public facilities Relaxed restrictions and proactive models for multi-family cooperative housing, accessory dwelling units, and retrofitting Collocated and cooperative models for living, working, and taking care of families aren’t new–nor are such spaces that specifically meet the needs of women. However, affordable, inclusive, and community-led spaces are exceedingly rare in the U.S. A city for caregivers would offer subsidy and technical assistance to create more locally-managed, women-led community work spaces that can sustainably meet work, social, family, and wellbeing needs of caregivers in their own neighborhoods. As our small survey corroborates, the demand for flexible space isn’t going to slow down. Coworking is a $9 billion global market that is expected to recover from the coronavirus shutdown and show growth by 2023. This moment is an opportunity to rethink what we value from the spaces that accommodate an increasingly flexible workforce. An existing trend that deserves attention is a small but growing number of coworking spaces owned by and/or center people of color. To name a few: The Coven in Minneapolis is an intersectional space that caters to women, non-binary, and trans women. Ethel’s Club in Brooklyn, New York is an intentional community serving people of color, that has creatively pivoted during coronavirus to serve members as a social and wellness platform. New Women Space is a new Brooklyn-based, inclusive, and women-led community organizing space. People in community organizing and development have long known how to do this work. Worker Centers are examples of social cooperatives or “gateway organizations” that provide training in workers’ rights, employment, labor and immigration law, legal services, the English language, and more. They may offer an inspiring model for dispersed collaboration and advocacy, without the necessity of a physical location. The international Mother Center movement has created hundreds of self-managed, protected public spaces for women and their children to meet informally in community on a daily basis. Building on best practices across a network, mother centers can be based on a tested approach, but customized in real time to the needs of the members and community. Importantly, any of these models might successfully include cooperative childcare in its services. In-depth work has been done by the Democracy at Work Institute and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies to map out proposals for how cooperative childcare can work in New York City. While we work toward subsidizing childcare and distance learning, it’s essential that American cities step up with space, funding, assistance, and support. This moment presents opportunity to follow the lead of women, particularly women of color, who have long been “making it work” during and before the pandemic and are the experts in getting things done in their own communities. I recognize that my family has been fairly fortunate throughout the lockdown, but it has still been illuminating to feel just how little our society supports working parents and caregivers. We found ourselves paying daycare tuition during the height of lockdown just to help keep our daycare center afloat –we had the ability to pay, but it also seems to highlight just how poor the infrastructure is for childcare providers that support working parents and caregivers of young children. Additionally, we feel like we have no good choices facing us when I return to work. We don’t feel entirely comfortable sending our son back to daycare from a health/risk standpoint, but also feel like we have no choice given the demands of our jobs, having a newborn, and for his social/educational benefit. We also know that his teachers are relying on families like ours keeping their kids enrolled in order to remain employed, which feels like an unfair bind for childcare professionals to be in. Towards Mobility For All Caregivers move around cities in a unique way. Their travel patterns tend to be more multi-modal as they maximize efficiency. Women, particularly women of color, are less likely to own cars. Their trips are shorter and less routinized, and their stops more frequent, as they care for children while running errands. They are more likely to walk for transportation and less likely to walk for exercise or recreation. The Transportation Research Board found that single parents were disproportionately reliant on public transit, and that it was their childcare duties, rather than income or other economic factors, that caused this reliance. Meanwhile, our cities are historically built for a very different way of getting around. The consequences of auto-centric urban development are well-documented, from a range of negative health outcomes to racial segregation to loneliness. And while optimizing cities for commuting is a longstanding urban tradition, there’s been a historically narrow definition of what a “commute” looks like: the same, linear trip across a region at the same time, twice each day. This definition, in effect, erases the more varied experiences and unique travel patterns of caretakers. Freeways may be built to get from point A to point B, but transit systems are built, and priced, to do much the same. And this has very real consequences in gender equity: the UK’s Office for National Statistics found that women are more likely to quit a job over a long commute. “I really hope that workplaces realize that telecommuting is essential for parents with children. While working at home with kids IS stressful, rushing to get them around the city every day is not something I miss. When I am to get things done, I have the time and space to do it. Generally, I think my quality of life is better because I am not rushing through my day.” “We felt we needed to have a car in case we needed to leave the city quickly. We didn’t want to be dependent on public transportation.” Transit by any mode is only effective if it feels safe, and there remains a significant divide in the way men and women perceive the safety of the built environment. The UN’s Habitat 3 Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development found that perception of danger in the built environment is a critical hindrance in global gender equality. Safety is the key driving force in the practice of gender-conscious public space design, because unsafe spaces essentially bar women and female-identifying people from participating in the public sphere. Women who are caretakers may be even further attuned to danger, and rightfully so: a safe environment for recreation and socialization as a child appears to be a significant factor in lifelong health outcomes. Cities built to center the experiences and needs of female caregivers must be: Truly pedestrian focused, where lack of car ownership is no longer a marker of second-class citizenship, and walking is as dignified, convenient, and safe as driving. (Beyond immediate physical safety, a recent study in American Psychologist found growing up in a walkable place was correlated to higher earning power later in life.) Not just transit-oriented, but built to facilitate varied, short trips with many stops in a way that is both convenient and affordable, such as offering distance-based pricing rather than a flat trip rate. Built for multi-modal trips while carrying children, strollers, groceries, and other trappings of the caregiver’s daily routine. Fortunately, the coronavirus crisis and the related rethinking of built-environment priorities brings with it some key opportunities to make strides towards a mobility that is truly caregiver-friendly. We must at long last rework our streets to calm traffic and offer more and safer pedestrian routes in all communities, as Paris and other cities are doing. We must prioritize buses and dedicated busways city-wide. Buses are not just disproportionately used by women, people of color, parents, and lower-income New Yorkers, they also offer a safer public transit alternative than subways as the city reopens (in New York, bus ridership has rebounded much faster than subway ridership after the peak of the crisis in April 2020). Beyond expansions of existing safe streets programs and growing the bus network, now is the time to think on an even bolder scale. There is a growing chorus of urban thinkers advocating for universal free transit as a basic right. Such a policy would disproportionately improve access to economic opportunity for women and people of color. And cycling advocates have long called for cities to prioritize safe cycling infrastructure so that cycling becomes a legitimate transportation option for women and families, reducing reliance on both cars and public transit. There is proof of concept: Both of these ideas have been successfully implemented in many other cities, where political will didn’t need a crisis to reach a groundswell. Of course, bold or incremental, these improvements need to be prioritized where they will make the greatest impact: on neighborhoods with a disproportionately greater share of single, working class caregivers, especially women of color. Access to a safe, reliable form of mobility is key not just to economic recovery, but to economic survival in a post-Covid world. It’s time to stop overlooking the experiences and needs of caregivers. Conclusion The Covid crisis has both laid bare and exacerbated longstanding inequities in the way we experience and move around the places we live. For many, it has shifted the workplace into the domestic space, blurred lines between paid and unpaid labor, and restricted mobility. It has made being a caregiver, an already burdensome job, more difficult, particularly for those who already face systemic oppression. It is difficult to overstate the misery it has caused. But the pandemic has also forced an inflection point; the sheer magnitude of its economic and social destruction is clear to nearly everyone (the willful ignorance of certain leaders aside). And with this almost-universally-acknowledged inflection point comes a rare opportunity to reimagine some of the fundamental systems that have led to our entrenched inequities: how we work, how we move, how we care for each other. What we are experiencing is a once-in-a-lifetime will to change. It may even be the beginnings of a true political realignment. Will we squander the opportunity to build more equitable cities that truly meet the needs of all residents, in particular those who have been left out for so long? The answer rests in the ability of planners, designers, and decision-makers to approach solution-building with open hearts and open ears. Caregivers are well-versed in making do with the inconvenient bare minimum, and adapting systems not designed for them to basic functionality. They’re resourceful, perceptive, and the very definition of hard-working. It’s time to let them lead. Note: We use women not to reinforce a gender binary, but rather to understand its effects on a diverse group of people. In this article the term women refers inclusively to anyone who identifies as a woman or with the female gender. This might include people who are cisgender, transgender, non-binary, or anyone who has a female gender expression. Survey Insights ↓ To ground our qualitative research, we captured some additional data from our respondents. Here are a few highlights: 62 people responded to the survey. Of these: 60 respondents were caregivers of children, with an average of 1.6 children per household, with household sizes ranging from 2-6 83% of parents were married and living with a spouse, and another 6.7% lived with a partner Nearly half (46.8%) had children under 3 years old, and another quarter (27.3%) had children between 4-6 years old. 9.1% had older teens age 14-18 All identified their gender as female or non-binary/third gender, and a majority of the partnerships described in the research were hetero relationships All respondents were over age 30. Most were between 35-40 years old (39%) and 40-50 (37.3%) 73.3% of respondents identified their race or ethnicity as White, 10% Black or African American, 5% Asian, 3.3% as Latinx or Hispanic, and 8.3% as Other* Employed women across the economic spectrum are carrying a dual burden of managing stressful situations at home while also navigating exacerbated workplace stress caused by coronavirus. Only about 10% of respondents to our survey said they were “not at all concerned” about their employment status. 55% said they were very, highly, or extremely concerned about their employment status. On the whole, the women we surveyed earned good, middle and upper middle-class incomes (when working) and represented a somewhat diverse economic range. 16.9% earned over $200,000, 35.6% earned between $100-200,000, 28.8% earned between $70-100,000, 13.6% earned between $50-70,000, and 5.1% earned between $20-50,000. No respondents selected the option provided for incomes under $20,000. Only about 14% of survey respondents expressed an explicit desire to return to a full-time office schedule. Several of these respondents shared that returning to an in-person workplace is important for the work they do–teaching, non-essential healthcare professions, roles with physical job sites. Respondents voluntarily opted into participating in this survey, which was distributed digitally through social media channels, with a focus on reaching local NYC parent Facebook groups and email lists. The survey was conducted in July 2020. *Due to a form error, respondents could only choose one race/ethnicity category.

The Essential, Invisible Night: Illuminating Cities for Essential Workers Posted on September 4, 2020 The architectural and urban design professions are day-biased, even as night is a full 50% of the world’s time. My years of work as an urban lighting designer have expanded to propose an interdisciplinary awareness of night as place. Nighttime design is a long overdue area of study and implementation. Holistically applied it could directly affect physical -and mental –health, and safety, for “essential” nightshift workers by focusing on legibility and late-night services. In this paper, the various categories of night work are used: shift-work is an overall term to differentiate from the normative day-shift. Other terms are, for example, night-shift, second-shift, third-shift and graveyard shift. Second (or evening) shift starts around 2 to 6 p.m. and ends between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Night-shift (or third or graveyard) starts around 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. and ends around 5 to 8 a.m. This think piece targets issues that have existed before and during the pandemic. However, because of the pandemic, I posit that a relevant synergy between “essential” “worker” and “night” remain cynically unaddressed. While the city and state of New York has lauded (and applauded) those of us who work tirelessly to keep the wheels of society and commerce turning. At the same time, it is disingenuous to avoid consideration of public-space working conditions that are critical to our key workers, that is, the hours between dusk and dawn. Why is this important? From the outset, night-shift workers’ conditions are inequitable. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18% of the 11-million service workers in the protective, food, and cleaning sectors work the evening and night shifts. And, significantly, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health states that “Both shift work and long work hours have been associated with health and safety risks.” Additionally, shift work is associated with diet-related chronic conditions such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, per “Influences on Dietary Choices during Day versus Night Shift in Shift Workers” (from Nutrients 2017). These are but two salient studies. Thus, re-contextualizing night-space as a workplace, urban design opportunities arise for imaginative and functional solutions in regard to transportation (transit and micro-mobility), retail open and closing hours, street design and streetscape amenities, and availability of nighttime services, to name a few. Further to understanding the plight of the graveyard shift population, the seminal 2009 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 30-page document, “Psychological and Social Support for Essential Service Workers During an Influenza Pandemic” addresses both the psychological and social needs of essential service workers during a pandemic. The authors define these workers to include “healthcare workers, public health workers, first-responder organizations, and employees of public utilities, sanitation, transportation, and food and medicine supply- chain companies.” All of these key workers are likely to be employed on second and third -shift work. Equity issues are involved, as the New York State essential-worker definition expands upon the CDC’s, and includes not only the professional classes but also those who take care of our mail and shipping, laundromats, building cleaning and maintenance, childcare services and warehouse jobs. All of these roles have nighttime shifts, and are so-called “low-skilled” or blue collar. UCLA’s Neuropsychiatric Institute’s Dr. Carole Lieberman, indicates that “Night shift workers begin to feel like second-class citizens. They begin to feel invisible.” There is a diagnosis for those who cannot adjust to changes in the sleep/wake cycle, or circadian rhythm: Shift Work Disorder. Symptoms include sleepiness, often coupled with insomnia and depression. In addition to the individual Disorder symptoms, described above, extrinsic, gender-based, night-space brutality is a facet of daily life for women. Design, from a harm reduction point of view, can begin to address the darkened work and mobility environment, as briefly enumerated below. International Labour Organization co-authored with UN Women’s “Handbook: Addressing violence and harassment against women in the world of work”, repeatedly enumerates that traversing the city to and from home and transit, is dangerous for women, especially in regard to sexual harassment and assault, “particularly affecting women working shifts and having to travel by foot or public transport in the dark or late at night. Preventative actions by local authorities – such as improving street lighting or the positioning of bus stops – can have a beneficial impact on making women’s, as well as men’s, lives safer when they commute to work.” Design Solutions: We suggest that districts with a preponderance of shift workers and neighborhoods with night work sites, such as hospitals, transportation and transit hubs and warehouses be designated night zones in order to benefit from night-focused interdisciplinary design solutions. For example, consider the northeast section of New York City’s Bronx, a future recipient of a Metro-north transit line. This district contains a preponderance of 24-hour work sites, including more than nine hospitals, one of the largest food distribution centers in the world, and nearby, the George Washington Bridge Bus Station with connections for transit riders during the dark morning and evening hours, as well as 24-hour drivers starting and returning to the Bus Station itself. Fearful nighttime conditions can be ameliorated and turned positive with creative design collaboration inclusive of architectural disciplines, landscape, illumination, wayfinding and security. New approaches to nighttime design would focus on lighting and legibility for first and last mile transit corridors, enhanced bus stops for late night ridership needs, and public space amenities for shift workers adjacent to workspaces. Typical design tactics, starting with existing conditions studies are relevant. For example, a Shades of Night analysis, which is a framework to measure human activity in relation to environmental changes such as open-shut hours and lighting should be undertaken to characterize after-dark populations, their movement and needs. Consultant teams for nighttime design must be assembled to address shortcomings of the district. Which consultants can address safe meeting places? How about availability of food purveyors, including food trucks? Are night transit options that relate to local worksites in place? What about after-dark cultural offerings and protected public spaces, such as all-night libraries? These are experts in addition to the ones already mentioned, such as those well versed in permitting, sustainability, community engagement and real estate, among others. For rapidity, tactical urban and lighting solutions could be devised in the form of measurable pilots that would be planned as participatory exercises that concurrently build community capacity in the self-same districts. Longer term, smart technologies are available to enhance amenities and wayfinding. Let’s value essential, heretofore invisible, shift-workers as they work and traverse the dark city by establishing welcoming, safe public spaces.

Understanding Our Future Social Infrastructure Posted on September 4, 2020 Humans by our nature are social beings. During this time of the pandemic, we are continuously adapting our interactions with one other. Many of us have been utilizing technology to connect digitally or the trend of singing or cheering at 7 pm from our balconies and windows; both early accommodations responding to social distancing mandates.

Not only in how we understand and connect with others in our personal relationships, but the various collaborations required of our core work as passionate designers. The pragmatics of socializing needs to be reconsidered to inform our work in addressing the future public realm. This work requires collaboration, simply because the public realm is far too complex for any one person or discipline to engage alone. Tuballoon Kongsberg Jazz Festival. Photo: Robert Sannes In Kevin Lynch’s book Image of the City he proposes that created in the minds of people experiencing a city, is a mental map composed of Paths, Edges, Districts, Nodes, and Landmarks. Today, we might expand this notion of internalized topographies further, with the understanding that Lynch’s urban elements are idiosyncratic and deeply personal. For example, a district could be perceived simultaneously as both vibrant and desolate – it depends on who is imaging the city. Considering this, we might ask how the social infrastructure of our cities can contribute and expand these maps and become a clearer, shared physical network that stitches together many places and people. We understand and occupy our cities via the social infrastructure that is in place. Today, examples include our transportation corridors, parks and plazas, libraries, museums, cafes and restaurants, schools, healthcare and community centers, and other facilities that support daily life. In this time of the pandemic, along with the pursuit for greater social and environmental justice, how might our social infrastructure adapt to create a more robust and expanded network for all? Times Square Reconstruction. Before: Mark Williamson After: Michael Grimm In the most basic sense, the role of architecture throughout history has been to provide shelter. As we look more to outdoor environments in response to the restrictions the ongoing pandemic imposes upon us, we begin to see how, in partnership with architecture, landscape architecture takes on an even more pronounced contribution to an expanded notion of shelter. Together we can begin to envision and adapt our cities and urban spaces to expand our social network; from restaurants in our streets to classrooms in our parks. Our definition of shelter might now take on the added necessity of being read from multiple points of view. As we consider our collective future, we should explore a variety of questions: What is the role social infrastructure has played within our communities and how might this evolve or expand? How can this current situation help re-envision our core values of social infrastructure? How might the methods in which we socialize adapt? Where will we meet, when and how? What are the modes of connection we will utilize? How will our perceptions of safety influence the nature of how we socialize? In what ways can past pandemic responses inform adaptations we make today? Can our outdoor landscape become more deftly intertwined with schools, restaurants, or other historically indoor activities? Can we find ways to promote the chance interactions that bring us together with those who have differing points of view or life experiences; each helping us to understand and relate with broader, more diverse, points of view?

Among the most vulnerable of these communities are seniors, who make up roughly 73% of COVID-19 deaths in New York City. As we see how places like retirement homes, public spaces, and grocery stores become less safe and less accessible for seniors, it becomes clear that a vulnerable group like the aging population and the challenges that they face in the urban environment should be put front and center rather than in the periphery when designing for urban life. In light of COVID-19 and beyond, we propose the following ideas to help seniors age in place: Expanding the role of postal workers; Introducing seniors-only hours in New York; Prompting intergenerational relationships digitally; and Creating joint housing arrangements for seniors and affordable housing residents. We view these solutions as holistic approaches to improving cities for the aging population as it can address concerns about mental well-being, access, agency, and physical safety — which can potentially be beneficial to other populations as well. Expanding the role of postal workers Inspired by Japan Post, we see the potential of the post officer’s role to not only deliver mail from house to house, but also to provide support to those they deliver mail to. This can be especially comforting for seniors who have little to no physical and social interaction with others. Not only is this an opportunity for seniors to stay connected with their loved ones, as it is also a worthwhile opportunity to rethink the US Postal Service’s role in our communities and save it from the dire financial challenges it currently faces. Post officers can visit homes of seniors and check-in on them by asking how they are doing and providing any necessary social support. Family members and friends of seniors can subscribe to this service at an affordable rate (priced on a sliding scale), which will in turn contribute to increased revenue for the money-strapped US Postal Service Postal workers can exchange notes or log responses for family members to look at, which can help family members track the well-being of their loved one Introducing seniors-only hours in New York Inspired by the seniors only grocery store hour guidelines, we propose expanding the seniors-only hour concept to other aspects of public life. This entails that during certain hours of the day, most individuals stay indoors, while seniors can take time to go outdoors. By implementing this rule, seniors can have time outside to exercise or take a stroll while feeling safe about doing so. Aside from designated hours, providing designated areas for seniors within public spaces can be another configuration of this initiative. Spaces such as parks, plazas, and public libraries can have senior-exclusive areas that will be designed particularly for their comfort and pleasure. This could look like having a seniors garden within a park or a seniors patio at the library, where there can be ergonomic chairs for the elderly and programs like exercise and bonding activities. Prompting intergenerational relationships digitally We propose using intergenerational programming to create connections between children and seniors that will combat loneliness and psychological fallout brought about by prolonged isolation. Ideas for such programs include: Incorporating a Pen Pal program to connect seniors and children, which can be done through a partnership between schools, youth centers, senior centers, retirement homes, andnursing homes. Providing technology training to seniors to connect them to digital platforms such as online exercises, meditation classes, discussion groups, and workshops. The New York Public Library has thousands of similar free, public programs such as the TechConnect program, and a separate initiative focused on providing seniors with access to necessary hardware and software will be a valuable first step for them to participate in these online programs. Such efforts can also potentially inspire the design of devices and digital interfaces for seniors. Creating joint housing arrangements for seniors and affordable housing resident NYC has long had a housing affordability problem and the city can also be very isolating, especially in light of social distancing. We propose an affordable housing model that combats social isolation; housing units that pair seniors who live alone with individuals in need of affordable housing, for example, students or artists. As a way to subsidize their rent, individuals might contribute by helping the senior to do chores which are too physically demanding, walking their dog, checking in on them when they are sick, and spending time with them. This model will provide the social and community support that is so important for seniors, but the model is really about reciprocity. Seniors have much to offer the relationship as well; they have lived experiences to share and they often have more time for things like cooking or caring for houseplants. Additionally, seniors aren’t the only ones who experience social isolation, especially during COVID-19; many individuals experience loneliness when they live far away from family or just by themselves, and stress when dealing with things like a job loss or a health concern. Through this housing model, both parties will gain greater, more intergenerational social connections and in the case of a future pandemic, can be a part of an isolation pod together, ensuring the continued physical and mental well-being of each other. There are many possible arrangements for this: Affordable Student Units in a Market Rate Seniors Building Modeled partially after Humanitas Retirement home in the Netherlands Unoccupied rooms in seniors-owned houses will become potential living spaces for students who are deemed to have financial need, which could be determined based on an application and selection process facilitated by partner universities. Each chosen student will be trained on how to support seniors, then paired up with a senior buddy to spend a certain amount of time hanging out or helping them out each week. In return, students get subsidized rent and their own living space. Artists-in-Retirement-Residence Modeled after Judson Manor in Cleveland, Ohio Similar to artists-in-residence programs, artists and seniors live together in a housing complex. Artists are given living and work spaces and give lessons and/or performances as well as socially contribute to the retirement home. Home Share Modeled after the Toronto Home Share Pilot Project Seniors who own their property and have an extra room lease it out to qualified individuals with financial need. Individuals contribute socially as well as by taking on household chores and errands Reflections The above mentioned proposals aim to help seniors age in place by redesigning city services to mitigate health risks and allow for increased agency. Seniors should be at the center of planning and implementation rather than at the periphery. We believe that the future of the city post pandemic needs to prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations – which means seniors and other populations should be involved as power holders and decision makers in urban design. Solutions designed for seniors in turn make the city better for everyone. Addressing the needs of seniors will greatly help to create a more just New York City.

Amplifying Emergency Response on a Local Scale Posted on September 4, 2020 Rapid Resilience is a deployable emergency response program that was formed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as a platform for grassroots emergency response initiatives. Rapid Resilience empowers grassroots aid efforts in disenfranchised communities and since its initiation in March, has delivered personal protective equipment (PPE) to medical workers across the country. Additionally, the program provided COVID-protection in vulnerable low-income communities including, prisons and Native American communities, and built urban cooling infrastructure for heat waves. Rapid Resilience’s model has and continues to support and amplify local end-to-end emergency response and recovery efforts. Background: From a Local Campaign to a National Network A crisis can shift priorities in profound ways. During the height of the first COVID-19 outbreak in March, it became clear that modes of operation had to change and high-speed, collaborative action was necessary to stop the exponentially growing public health crisis. This is what sparked the MaskForce, a group of volunteers working with the Brooklyn-based nonprofit RETI Center to deliver triage PPE to frontline healthcare workers. Delivery of protective masks to prison medical staff during the height of New York State’s outbreak. Recognizing that many fast-paced volunteer efforts burn-out, the group formed Rapid Resilience, a RETI Center initiative. Conceived as a centralizing platform and support-structure for volunteer-led efforts, Rapid Resilience maximizes the impact of independent, crisis response-related campaigns like MaskForce. What started as a single team’s COVID-19 PPE response has become an emergent network of disaster response initiatives that responds to crises as they arise on the ground. A Model for a Scalable & Adaptable Disaster Response Rapid Resilience is an organizational model for collaboration and action for a wide range of issues. As a scalable network of individuals and groups plugged into vulnerable communities, Rapid Resilience is able to adapt to crises as they arise, and shift efforts based on feedback on the ground. This action-oriented grassroots model works beyond the demands of COVID-19 as a way to respond to any emergency, including climate change. A core mission of Rapid Resilience is to provide aid for communities faced with disaster through grassroots tactics. Before COVID-19, RETI Center’s programs focused on justice in the face of climate change, by building strength in communities through resiliency-focused economic development. It was observed that the same disparities that make communities vulnerable to climate change are highly correlated to COVID-19 casualties. In disasters in general, whether it’s a pandemic or extreme weather event, disproportionate damage falls on low-income populations, particularly people of color. Protective equipment was delivered directly to medical workers based on level of need. Rapid Resilience supplied PPE to these frontline healthcare workers in Boston when they were facing shortages. The Rapid Resilience network extends to individuals and groups providing aid in hard-hit communities across the country, working with them to give them the tools they need to fund the purchase of PPE and other aid supplies, and maximize their impact through streamlined processes. By working with the Rapid Resilience network, local initiatives across the country gained access to resources and support for each of the steps of the emergency response process. First Responder for First Responders Rapid Resilience began as a response effort to protect the frontline medical workers. A lack of coordination and proactive action from state and federal governments has led to waves of critical PPE shortages. The core problem the team identified was a disconnect between large-scale suppliers (mostly in China), centralized hospital administration, and the frontline medical staff who need comparatively small quantities of PPE. This supply-chain shortage was most acute at healthcare facilities in low-income communities. Through their coordinated efforts, Rapid Resilience plugged this gap by fast-tracking supplies from factories abroad, and kept costs low by aggregating individual campaigns into a unified PPE-purchasing collective. PPE requests are received directly from medical workers, and assessed by level of urgency. Once supplies reach Rapid Resilience teams, volunteers deliver them directly to healthcare professionals. The group learned several key lessons it continues to apply; combined sourcing reduces cost and corruption in the supply-chain, and direct communications with people in need ensures the right amount and type of supplies are delivered. To-Date the Rapid Resilience frontline worker campaigns (MaskForce, Last Mile, Mission:Masks, and Masks for Midwives) have delivered 100,115 pieces of PPE equipment to frontline medical workers across the country. PPE to the People As supply chains adapted to meet the demand for PPE in the medical community, Rapid Resilience organically shifted its efforts to providing protection to essential workers and high-risk populations that were being disproportionately exposed to COVID-19. Working with local contacts the Rapid Resilience network was able to provide non-medical PPE to the Black Lives Matter organization, public housing residents, nursing homes, Native American reservations in the Southwest and Midwest, and essential workers lacking adequate resources. To-Date Rapid Resilience campaigns (Last Mile, PPE New Mexico, and Rapid Resilience central) have delivered 7,380 pieces of PPE to vulnerable communities and groups across the country. Cool Streets NYC The Rapid Resilience group has recently launched the Cool Streets program, in partnership with the Center for Resilient Cities and Landscapes, to design shade and cooling structures with the community to protect people from extreme heat in NYC when city facilities are inaccessible. From the beginning, the Rapid Resilience team has been cognizant of how racially and economically-based impacts would escalate, and the public amenities we all enjoy access to are the commons that we all share and the places where we meet and interact. However, for low-income communities, there are no alternatives to mass transit, parks as outdoor spaces, and the streets as community spaces as our public facilities closed for an indeterminate time. We have to keep in mind future asymmetrical dangers that will escalate as a result of further reductions in “the commons,” those public amenities we benefit from. Check out the Interactive map of deliverables made through the Rapid Resilience Initiative. Rapid Resilience is an initiative of NYC-based Resilience, Education, Training and Innovation (RETI) Center — a 501(c)3 nonprofit born out of Superstorm Sandy with a mission to build resilient communities.

Mutual Aid as a Long-Term Solution Posted on September 4, 2020 At this time of nationwide lockdown, people are physically apart; we also realize once again, in the nonphysical sense, how discrete the country is, and so is the world. People experience different realities: some are hearing ongoing sirens, mourning without saying proper goodbye to family members and lining up for food for hours while others can safely stay at and work from home with all resources at their disposal. People have disparate solutions, and some with none for this crisis. Longstanding equity issues surface as funding, healthcare and other resources get stretched and strained. These problems will only exacerbate, creating more polarized cities, if we do not take concrete measures to address them. One step towards a resilient and just recovery is to bridge the gaps by strengthening social connections and facilitate intergroup conversations, so people start hearing different voices and understanding each other. Many mutual aid projects have made the news since the beginning of the pandemic, and new relationships are formed everyday. Well-resourced college students are talking to empty nest seniors. Block residents are helping their neighbors working on the frontline to take care of their children while they perform their duties. These interactions are precious, because people get to connect with others on a personal and intimate level, especially with those who they might not have the opportunity to do so in a normal world. Invisible Hands is an amazing initiative that came to fruition once a group of twenty-somethings realized their community needed help. This video shows the beauty of mutual aid work. Many more social connections were already well-established prior to the crisis, and this trying situation only affirms the importance of reinforcing them. My nonprofit organization supports grassroots community improvement projects in New York City, and we’ve witnessed neighbors, gardeners, parents, teachers, artists, tenant organizers and activists bringing their communities together to make their neighborhoods better. Our work and that of those in our network are the complete opposite of “social distancing.” We shall probably phrase it as “physical distancing,” as in this new reality, the community organizing work is not ceasing but only taking other forms, such as virtual communications or just standing six-feet apart. The grassroots leaders are still working hard to support their community members, and in some instances they appear to be positioned well for these tasks. COVID-19 is a pandemic and concerns all, but it is also highly personal: people are losing loved ones, trying to pay for rent and essential items and dealing with a lot of stress. Therefore, providing the necessary assistance and support requires sensitivity and compassion. Grassroots leaders usually know their group members or are known by them, so they see well or can figure out the specific needs and resources in their respective communities. As these dedicated leaders occupy a niche in the relief and recovery schemes, government officials, experts, scholars and others with resources shall hear from them and back them up. This particular moment avails opportunities to reexamine community groups’ ongoing outreach strategies, enhance existing connections and identify new networks as well as partnerships. Besides financial and other basic resources, cities shall cultivate an environment receptive to positive social connections. In addition to technical support on outreach strategies, providing internet connection, devices and relevant infrastructure can also be instrumental in many neighborhoods as people are connecting in new ways. Whether to sustain the new relationships formed during the pandemic and how to achieve that goal is yet to be determined, bu we could potentially transform the mutual aid efforts to long-term rescue for disadvantaged population or emergency preparation. Reinforcing established networks will allow for more equitable development as a collective voice is often stronger and harder to suppress than an individual outcry. Illustration by Mary Kate McDevitt. Published on Curbed NYC “Can a Neighborhood Become a Network?” on Jun 23, 2020. When we surveyed and talked to community leaders in our network, we found out that access to mental health support was among the top priorities. Before rebuilding the normalcy, we have to recognize and heal the wounds first; facilitating empathetic inner- and inter-group conversations may be one of the remedies. For example, youth might experience depression as they are separated from friends, witnessing passing of close family members and receiving little instructions with remote learning. Many need to process these emotions with a close circle of people that they are comfortable with. On the other hand, other stories need to be heard by more. Reading about homebound residents in a tweet is never as compelling as hearing about the plights in person. However, we shall also take caution to not exploit the narratives as they contain people’s real sorrow and trauma. The fast-paced and omnipresent information sharing through the web these days creates the illusion that we are more connected and know more about others than ever before. When we become satisfied with objecting another person with a “punchy” new comment on Facebook and never go back for their response, or get into quarrels without substance, we are shutting down communications. Intergroup connections may be constructive if we can facilitate effective conversations, not necessarily aiming to reach an agreement but to truly hear the other perspectives. Cultivating social connections and promoting empathetic conversations are not the panacea to all the problems that we are and will be facing, but shall lead us to a more equitable recovery post-Coronavirus.

Design For Six Feet: A Crowd-Sourced Catalog of Ideas for Restarting Urban Life Posted on September 4, 2020 Since the @designforsixfeet Instagram account was launched in mid-May we have received submissions and ideas from around the globe – from individuals, neighbors and community groups, and municipalities who are responding to the pandemic with speed and creativity. Many of these ideas were meant to be experimental and short-term, but we are already seeing that some might be here to stay. Since launching, we’ve seen a shift in the type of tactical urbanism solutions that have been shared with us on Instagram. In many ways, this shift reflects our changing understanding of how COVID-19 is transmitted, our responses to new municipal policy and government regulation, and a deepening sense of the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on communities. As those who were lucky enough to stay sheltered in place ventured out into public space again, we saw a focus on regaining mobility while maintaining distance. Miles and miles of new bicycle lanes were rolled out, tape redefined our movements, and people were playful about how to use ‘nature’ as a divider. Neighbors interacted from balconies and in courtyard spaces (and people shared proposals for how to rethink zoning to make sure it is easier to build these types of spaces moving forward). We saw “physical distancing” give way to “social distancing” with the rigid circles and dots becoming a bit more fluid. Streets, sidewalks, and parking lots continue to be reclaimed by people for al fresco dining, Zumba classes, play streets, and more. And throughout it all, we have seen people making their design solutions available to all — from building public handwashing stations to upcycling materials to construct barriers for outdoor dining to designing play equipment.

MultipliCity: Creating Resiliency Through Design Posted on September 4, 2020 The Madison Square Park neighborhood offers opportunities for transformation and is a testing ground for the ideas of multipliCity. MultipliCity is a design philosophy that embraces the growth and evolution of the city as a response to post-pandemic life. MultipliCity channels the energy of a growing, changing city into creating a more resilient and desirable way of urban life. MultipliCity enhances neighborhoods with layers of experiences and creates more spaces for people to inhabit. Through placemaking and strategic redevelopment, MultipliCity allows people in dense urban areas to have more access to public space. Giuseppe Mengoni’s addition of the Vittorio Emmanuel II Galleria is a stellar example of existing urban fabric being extended, enhanced, and enriched through careful insertions. The pandemic has left us questioning density and considering alternatives. We live in a world with unprecedented choice. We have greater options for mobility and communication, we have advanced systems that enable us to work and play from anywhere. We have greater access to goods and services than ever before without having to leave our homes. The pandemic has further precipitated an acceleration of the infrastructures that make these choices possible. The world has changed, and technology has offered us the choice of whether we wish to return to the city. How can the post-pandemic city compete? How can it survive and thrive in a world with many alternate choices? multipliCity is the design approach for an adaptable and resilient city. It proposes robust physical design ideas for the city, where buildings and spaces are designed together to extend and enhance the life of the city. It offers complete, safe, convenient, and one-of-a-kind experiences that are distinct and different from the suburbs. It builds resiliency, adaptability, redundancy, and flexibility into the DNA of its fabric. It extends, enhances, enriches, and updates the public realm to reflect our new realities and lifestyles. It provides an architecture that delights and stimulates the soul. It unifies buildings and spaces into a cohesive urban realm for maximum impact. It designs and curates journeys that are as important as the destinations. 3. Well-designed cities are timeless; today, the bones of Milan’s renaissance-era urban fabric make for a wonderful public realm filled with options for living, working, dining, shopping, gathering, and admiring the city. The Great Public Square is the full realization of a design viewpoint where buildings and spaces that are inextricably linked. Multiply Experiences Cities are experienced as a continuum – full and empty, at different times and in different seasons, in stillness and in chaos, through booms, recessions, celebrations, and crises – and everywhere in between. They are experienced as a collective that is greater than the sum of their buildings, streets, and public spaces. Cities must be purposefully designed to fully integrate architecture with the public realm. One cannot exist without the other. At a time when urban density is under assault, the model of the city will survive only if it accommodates, adapts, and most of all, delights. The neighborhood is the microcosm of the city. Multiplying the experience of the city through all its neighborhoods is the most equitable way for each citizen to partake in it. Perkins Eastman’s proposal for the Port Authority Bus Terminal re-purposes the Javits Center into a multi-modal facility for New York City. Working creatively within the constraints of an inherited city will ensure that it is able to adapt and move forward with the times. Multiply Resiliency Redundancy is resiliency. Cities must be embedded with fail-safe mechanisms that allow them to operate in more ways than one. The city must be designed to be nimble. If public transit poses risks, citizens must be able to walk or bicycle to their workplaces. If the physical office become obsolete, downtowns must be able to convert to other functions. If open space falls short of social distancing demands, streets must become an extension of the public realm. If food supply chains are disrupted, green space must double up as urban farmland. Duplicating these infrastructures of resiliency across the entire city is the surest way to ensure its sustainability and survival. A proposal from Perkins Eastman’s annual Public Realm Scholarship reclaims New York City’s streets for its people. Perkins Eastman’s designs for the TKTS booth in Manhattan and Target Field Station in Minneapolis take this to the next level, demonstrating an overt and purposeful attitude towards the integration of open space and buildings. Multiply Open Space Streets are the lowest hanging fruit in conjuring up extra open space in a post-pandemic world. Many cities, including New York, are temporarily opening up more and more of their streets to pedestrians. This is only the first step. From boulevards to promenades, streets have had a long history of functioning as platforms for appreciating the city’s architecture and conducting public life. It was only America’s rapid embrace of the automobile that saw the street regress into a mere conduit for car-centric transportation. The contemporary street must be redefined as not just infrastructure, but architecture. It must be designed richly, with purpose. It must be tightly integrated with all that flanks it. And it must then be propagated across the city in this renewed and equitable format for the benefit and enjoyment of all. Perkins Eastman’s The Wharf in Washington DC puts the human experience at the forefront of design. Streets, buildings, and programming work together to create a complete and richly varied neighborhood. Multiply Places In many dense cities such as New York, people lack access to private open space in the form of patios, balconies, and backyards. The city then becomes an extension of one’s domestic space – it is what we rely on to unwind, socialize, entertain, and increasingly, to work. The public realm as an extension of one’s own backyard, or lack thereof, is not a new concept. The Dutch term woonerf, or shared street, literally translates to residential (woon) property (erf). This pandemic has underscored the limitations of centralized open spaces. For the city to become a truly democratic extension of the domestic, its public realm must be decentralized, multiplied, and brought within reach of every home in every neighborhood. Multiply Journeys The shared promenade at Perkins Eastman’s The Wharf in Washington DC is not just a linear park; it represents streets and spaces where the journey is just as important as the destination. It is a way for people to inhabit the city. The resurgence of pedestrian space in cities is central to making them more desirable. Suburban life is all about the destination. The journey itself is of no interest and is designed to be as short as possible. The city, by contrast, offers an opportunity for the journey to take center stage. The acts of strolling and walking allow us to forge appreciation for and connect with the architecture of our cities. The promenade (or the trail, the esplanade, the mall, the processional walk) is critical to the activation of the city. It allows for the vantage point of the observer to constantly change, which is essential to experiencing great architecture. It must be revived and thought of as both a physical space and purposeful activity, where the goal is the journey itself and not the destination. The promenade is not just a way to reduce conflict between cars and pedestrians – it is a reminder of the strong design link between buildings and public place. It is the center of a specific design viewpoint that is based upon the human experience. The empty city has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to examine the architecture and elements that make up great places. In order to convince people that the city is still a worthwhile model, its architecture must excite and stimulate. Its pedestrian realm must take the public through an itinerary and inventory of spaces that are choreographed to provide choice, comfort, flexibility, and connectedness. Its public spaces must enable people to safely socialize, communicate, and showcase their culture. They must command views and provide opportunities to pause and reflect. It must be updated to become more resilient. It must accommodate, adapt, and succeed under a myriad of circumstances. Pandemics of the past have transformed the trajectory of cities, often for the better. This is not a setback. This is an opportunity to recalibrate the city and bring it in line, through design and policy, with the demands of a changed world. Founded in 1981 in New York City, Perkins Eastman is a global architecture firm that has grown to include 1,000 employees working out of a combined 17 interdisciplinary offices around the world.

Expanding the Post-COVID Design Narrative Posted on September 4, 2020 Image Credit: Benjamin Cadena Since the start of Covid-19 lockdown and the 6-foot social distancing guidelines that came with it, there has been a lot of discussion within architecture and urban design communities about how it should respond. Some of us are rushing into rethinking our existing space planning conventions to permanently accommodate the 6-foot distance between people in public; we’ve seen the proposed redesign of New York City sidewalks; others are looking at how to interact with each other within a ‘safe distance’ in everyday environments, from doctor’s waiting rooms to museums. I find the sudden urge, the solely reactionary response to society’s fear with these measures, both unrealistic and wasteful. It prevents us from being proactive and looking at the bigger picture. How do we rethink our cities, in order to respond to the unexpected and unknown disasters still to come? A few things are clear: We will certainly have to respond to disasters more often than ever, whether due to climate change or globalization. And by now, we also know that in order to protect our earth, by being more resourceful and sustainable, we need to live in dense urban environments. Lastly, humans need to be social; we thrive on interaction. Rather than providing short-sighted solutions as a response to each individual disaster, we need to look at our cities in a more holistic way and be progressive in our thinking. We have to reexamine our overall building zoning system, how we use our existing infrastructure, the supply chain, our production network and consumption culture, and the relationship of our cities to other cities and regions, close and far. The Covid-19 pandemic revealed several important shortcomings in our system. Our current health care infrastructure was not ready to respond to a sudden peak of emergency cases. The situation overwhelmed our medical system and pushed it to the verge of collapse. We are now realizing that our supply chain and production and distribution systems are outdated. We are still using old zoning regulations for our city that don’t allow any flexibility for the use of existing building stock and infrastructure. As a result, we are very slow or often unable to respond to catastrophes. Finally, we have realized how fragile our democracy has become. Around the time of the 2016 elections and afterwards, we witnessed the limits of the Internet’s transparency; its horizontality and so-called ‘non-hierarchical’ and ‘non-mediated’ structure, as well as its threat to elements of democracy. We have realized the echo chambers that we have all been living in; the noise of mainstream media coverage, sensationalized storytelling and social media feeds that reverberate within closed systems. Now, in isolation due to Covid-19, we are bound to work and we depend on our basic necessities, but we are also learning to socialize, to share, to support, to have empathy, and to be intimate, through the digital world, where the walls of the echo chambers have thickened. Wearing a mask, a simple act of care for others around us during the biggest global pandemic of our decade, became a divisive political issue. As we work to resolve this crisis, these shortcomings should provide a roadmap for implementing long-term and forward-looking approaches for design of our cities that will benefit us beyond just the near future. Agile City During the current shutdown, some of the most interesting experiments happened on a micro scale. Some clothing manufacturers turn their production into making masks and scrubs. Architecture and design studios with 3D printers, plastic molding machines and laser cutters, quickly turned their model shops into facilities for producing protective face shields, patient isolation hoods and other much-needed medical components for hospitals. A series of restaurants shifted their dining service to delivering food to nearby hospitals, supported by donations from customers. The cleverness of looking at available resources and temporarily adapting your operations for urgent needs can serve as a model for adjustments on a larger scale. We cannot afford to see our building stock be used only for a certain designated program or use. We cannot afford to be only a library or a museum, a restaurant, a retail store or an architectural office. Although some of the larger institutions do embody multiple programs, they are designed to have a specific, designated program for each space. We need to be creative in how we adapt already existing technologies, infrastructures and resources to respond to urgent needs as they arise. We need to build spaces that are porous, multifunctional and adaptable. In order to be more resilient, we need to build an agile city. Dependent City In 2019, if somebody had told me that I would be on the verge of closing my studio because of a live animal market in China, where wildlife was sold as food, I would have said that it sounded like a bad movie script. Now we know how connected—and thus fragile—we are in this era of globalization. We have also seen how connected we are to each other in our own city and therefore rely on the well-being of our neighbors for our city, our economy, and our livelihood to be resilient. In New York City, the pandemic has made visible how inequality divides us. Data mapping shows how low-income areas, predominantly home to people of color and immigrant populations, have experienced much higher numbers of critical cases and more losses due to Covid-19 than anywhere else in the city. If we don’t want to overwhelm our medical infrastructure, we need to understand that we are living in a society where we are connected and rely on each other. We cannot continue to live in a city and time where the income inequality is widening and at its highest level in decades. In the introduction to his book Palaces for People: How Social Infrastructure Can Help Fight Inequality, Polarization and the Decline of Civic Life (2018), Eric Klinenberg talks about how two different African American neighborhoods in Chicago with the same high rates of poverty, unemployment and violent crimes responded radically different to a deathly heat wave during the summer of 1995. One neighborhood had three deaths while the other counted 33 deaths per 100,000 residents. The difference between these neighborhoods was the strength or lack of social infrastructure; the physical places and organizations that support and form the community and shape the way people interact. In the last two decades, new public space developments in New York City are characterized by public-private partnerships and initiated in areas where private real estate developers have a particular stake and interest. As a result, a majority of low-income neighborhoods lack the proper public and civic spaces that provide a good social infrastructure. In order to be more resilient, we need to realize that we cannot leave anyone behind in favor of our own prosperity. Participatory City Every day at 7pm, we go out to our balconies or windows to clap together to show our gratitude to medical workers or sing along to iconic New York songs, collective but individual. We are experiencing a new phenomenon where we are collective and participatory but physically distant. Covid-19 has dissociated the experience of collective and participatory from proximity in public space. In his book The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962), German philosopher and sociologist Jürgen Habermas defined the public sphere as the space between the state and the society, where public opinion is formed. Physical public space is a very important facet, if not the foundation, of this idea of the public sphere, but social media has emerged as another primary platform, shaped by the state and corporations that stand against individuals participating in open discussions and particularly against a critique of society. Within our echo chambers, social media was offered as an illusion for open discussion, but in reality, we are merely encouraged to collect and disseminate images and superficial information, decreasing the space for production of substantial knowledge and meaning. The realm of social media and other digital platforms in general prevents people from engaging with each other in complex ways. The recent limitations on physical public spaces, while a temporary measure and for valid medical reasons, keeps us from personal interaction, participation, and collective action. Once we come out of shelter-in place, the idea of constantly being 6 feet away from people, afraid to talk or interact in public space, risks being a major threat to our democracy. We need to understand the importance and power of open architecture, a physical space that provides the social infrastructure necessary to promote social exchange, conversation and the production of knowledge. More than ever, our civic spaces should be designed to be participatory that requires proximity in order to perform as a welcome antidote to the echo-chamber of the Internet. The question we, as architects and urban planners, should ask is: How do we continue to keep proximity and full engagement in public life a primary facet of our civic spaces, and how can we even encourage such interaction by design while still ensuring public health and safety? Engaging fully in and with our city is not an option; it should always be the priority if we want our democracy to survive. We will continue to face different challenges; not only medical but financial, political, environmental, and so on. To focus our design efforts only on an arbitrary measure of distance will only weaken the power of our cities. Instead, our resources should be focused on how to transform our social and physical infrastructures, so that our cities are more resilient.

Fluid Infrastructures: Building Societies in the 21st Century Posted on September 4, 2020 In both concept and design, infrastructures are usually considered as rigid and static, but Covid-19 has revealed that infrastructures have the potential to be malleable and can adjust to new needs and circumstances. Pop-up hospitals appearing in Central Park and online platforms replacing classrooms, offices, and concert halls have challenged our assumptions about how infrastructures can and should function. Yet these same circumstances have also revealed striking discrepancies in access and resources, all of which dictate how seamless and just the necessary adjustments have been. How we have responded to the pandemic points to why all elements of society building in the 21st century should embrace adaptability and flexibility. In looking to address ‘new normals’ and remedy resulting inequities, Coda Societies considers fluidity as an appropriate framework to approach the design and function of infrastructures. For clarity, we outline three categories of infrastructures: Soft infrastructures are foundational. They are the intangible mechanisms needed to maintain a functioning society, such as health care, education, and government systems. Hard infrastructures are material. They are the physical tools of society building, such as roads, parks, and oil refineries. Critical infrastructures are functional. They are the conduits through which other infrastructures are designed and disseminated, such as telecommunication, urban planning and energy. The infographic above maps a number of soft, hard and critical infrastructures and highlights the ways in which they link together three different sectors that have seemingly nothing in common: health, space travel, and retail. While the list of infrastructures that are highlighted is not exhaustive or hierarchical, we wanted to illustrate that they are interdependent and the means that link sectors together. A fluid approach to infrastructure design builds on the symbiosis between soft, critical, and hard infrastructures to optimize outcomes and ensure they are calibrated to changing environments. For infrastructures to be fluid, they have to meet the following criteria: Fluid infrastructures must be designed with the understanding and recognition that their form and function will constantly evolve. To the extent possible, all potential scenarios should be accounted for at their inception. Societies are inherently fluid – in constant flux. Ongoing environmental occurrences, demographic shifts, migratory trends and technological innovations, for example, have always been the motors of societal evolution. Globalization has merely accelerated this process. Looking to the United States, even the social contract, “the American Dream,” and its promise of rags to riches, is anchored in fluidity. At the personal level, individuals are increasingly comfortable with identifying as “fluid” both in terms of their gender and sexuality. Simply put, ideas, values, needs, identities and realities are constantly morphing. Societies are assessed on their capacity to ensure their members’ well being, and infrastructures need to adapt to multiple circumstances to deliver the necessary services. So how can infrastructures incorporate this dynamic into their design so as to ensure they best fulfill their purpose? These principles of fluid infrastructures manifest in three main ways. Fluid infrastructures are interconnected and complementary to other elements of an ecosystem: Once the murder capital of the world, Medellin, Colombia, is now home to a compelling example of fluid infrastructure. A system of outdoor escalators was built into the hills to address security concerns and connect these excluded neighbourhoods to the city center. As a result, residents from the hills were provided with greater mobility and access, facilitating their integration into Medellin’s ecosystem. The escalators exemplify fluid infrastructures by nature of their active inclusion of society members into city life. While occupying very little space, they fit perfectly into the natural typology, respond to a need, and complement other infrastructures, such as the subway system. Fluid infrastructures are responsive and adaptive to their users: As part of New York City’s 2017 affordable housing plan, HNY2.0, architecture firms utilized modular construction to provide low-income housing in previously uninhabited spaces. This initiative embraced the constraints of New York’s grid to better serve the City’s housing insecure populations – it re-examined pre-existing spaces to address pressing needs. This approach exemplifies how structures intended to endure long periods of time can in fact be fluid when adaptability and multifunctionality are core considerations in their design. This project also highlights how fluidity facilitates incorporating changing social dynamics into design; the user-centered ethos was intentional about not exacerbating unintended social consequences that can result from housing policies, such as segregation, displacement, and overcrowding. Applying a fluidity-lense to large scale place making provides answers for how we design post-Covid. Fluid infrastructures are purpose-driven as opposed to form-driven: Fluidity can and should shape all varieties of design and infrastructure, regardless of scale. Take, for example, malls. Retail spaces have typically been designed for the primary purpose of housing stores and facilitating consumption. Yet, at the core of this functional design are a couple of key values: economic vitality, of course, along with the genuine appreciation for human interaction and gathering. Now, with the indoor transmission of Covid-19, fewer people are physically going to malls, and store fronts face sharp pressure from the shift to online shopping. While these spaces might not be able to serve their intended use, if re-designed with fluidity, they could still realize their purpose as places for humanity. A mall could quickly adapt to serve as a hospital, temporary office space, distancing-conscious public place, distribution center, or venue for creatives. That way, the mall might change its form, but would still fulfill its original purpose as an engine of economic vitality and space for human interaction. A fluid approach to infrastructure design should not be employed just to react to shocks, but rather to proactively inform all of society building. Covid-19 has certainly prompted unprecedented changes, but is just one of the many crises we are likely to experience in the near future. Coda Societies sees the constant reframing and rethinking that comes with fluidity as key to ensuring that society building is an exercise in proactivity, and not simply reactivity. Ultimately, fluid design will facilitate the active incorporation of diverse voices, needs and perspectives – bringing us closer to a truly inclusive society, and informing this process in the most effective way. Alan Waxman ▷ Design with Viral Events Posted on September 4, 2020 Forces at play during a viral event: Vertical forces bring about greater integration into existing hierarchy in places such as hospitals, police stations, and government buildings. Horizontal forces push people to either stay put or leave, creating centripetal/ centrifugal forces around viral events. Since the onset of COVID-19, viral media has resonated with far-reaching consequences in the USA. We have watched videos of patients and doctors suffering from this horrifying disease, videos of people who broke quarantine admitting the guilt and responsibility of contracting and spreading the virus, and videos of violent use of force on innocent people: the murder of George Floyd, the manic threatened arrest of a black birder in a park, the public beating of an old man by police and enforcers, and attacks by masked weapon wielding “federal agents” on the young and old. These viral videos are moments in which the dynamics in our society are forced into the open, and embodied in physical confrontation. They become viral events – place based phenomena that resonate across social media. These dynamics have long existed, epidemiologically embodied in marginalized populations.1 Relationships between the state and marginalized populations create a psychosocial setting in which we are often “set up to fail,” “problematized,” and “damned if we do and damned if we don’t.”2 In this context, simply going about daily life puts us at risk of becoming subjects of abuse. Equanimity of mind is cultivated here to allow us the mental and physical space to persevere and flourish in this context. The infrastructure of social media plays out on the bodies of vulnerable populations within these power relationships, and is quickly becoming a tool of national political agenda.3 Forces of integration and exclusion flash in each powerful happening and resonate as viral events with implications at a national scale. Agencies are designing political outcomes by choreographing these viral events. Designers should consider how to create settings and viral events that minimize exclusion and maximize integration. Infrastructure of Viral events Viral events follow a pattern that leads to particular outcomes at scale: Public awareness of real structural risks, such as the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus are “virally” heightened by social media. As individuals and communities fail to heed dictates they become the site of vulnerability and embodied health risk. As people fall victim to these health risks, their stories of infringement, failure, and comeuppance are amplified by viral social media and the result is intensified public awareness of risk and need to follow dictates. As victims are framed as perpetrators they increasingly lose their ability to choose where they go or how they live and their rights are increasingly surrendered to overseers. In the confusion that follows, agencies implement designs of new social and material order by drawing boundaries of biopolitical risk and stigma. The events play out in spaces by way of simultaneous forces of integration and exclusion, vertical and horizontal. Vertical forces bring about greater integration into existing hierarchy in places such as hospitals, police stations, and government buildings. Here there are arrests, but also peaceful protest for legislative change. Vertical forces create change within the existing system. Horizontal forces push people to either stay put or leave, creating centripetal/ centrifugal forces around viral events. Horizontal forces can best be described as quarantine: closing borders, preventing travel, and increasing deportations. Migrant concentration camps are perhaps clear examples of both vertical and horizontal forces. The context of COVID-19 has triggered increases in these forces in countries around the world. The murder of George Floyd was both vertical and horizontal in the most ultimate way, resulting in his abduction and continued restraint until complete exclusion – murder – by Chauvin, a man operating as an ostenisble arm of the state. The feedback loop between the “viral” nature of an event in social media and the contextual power of the state is materialized in “real time:” “Viral” resonance further affects the context, intensifying the potential for similar happenings to occur, spawning more and more viral events. The chain reaction continues until it passes – creating a trajectory of “positive cases” of stigmatized events. COVID cases appear to reflect this trajectory. As positive cases are identified, more people come forward to be tested, driving up cases, especially in a liberal democracy. Likewise, as more cases of police brutality are highlighted, more people come forward to protest, bringing to light more cases of police brutality. This is in contrast to a record of total mortality rate over time, which traces the path of the actual SARS CoV-2 virus after the psychosocial viral events. The path of the biological virus is affected by the ability of agencies to actively prevent its spread by way or psychosocial design. See the graph below of actual mortality data in cities around the world. With greater fluidity and porousness of borders, “viral” events are less likely to be “controlled.” In a more government information dictated economy, the reverse pattern may be found. As more positive cases are identified, people may avoid repercussions, stay inside, and if people seek help at all, their voices may be silenced. This may explain the extremely low or quickly falling trajectory of positive cases of the virus in some countries. With the defunding of the WHO and Trump’s rerouting of information away from the CDC, the United States may be following suit. If progressives and conservatives demand strong leadership, we may be sowing seeds of potential fascism. The stronger the “fasces,” the greater the control, the quicker the results of containment or elimination of “viral” elements. Ultimately, a regime of this sort controls official data and can claim to have addressed issues of “viral” spread, whether or not the actual structural problem is solved or amplified. Viral Theaters Sites of viral destabilization like Hong Kong, Seattle’s CHAZ/CHOP, Minneapolis, Washington DC, and downtown Portland are experiencing both integration and exclusion, with protest, random abductions, detainment, and violent beatings. The purpose of the protest is vertical integration and the creation of structural change. The concentration camps at the US/Mexico border are sites of vertical and horizontal forces at work; as families are torn apart and adults and children are wrongfully incarcerated. We can expect to see vulnerable populations continue to play pivotal roles subject to both integration or exclusion. We should be particularly privy to how movements of integration can become exclusion. If a movement for reparations were to become, for instance, a movement for Black equity paid for by a banking and corporate housing subsidy, it may lead to greater exclusion rather than integration as suburbs become increasingly isolated and left behind. There are great cases for reparations, but if we seek financial equity in the currency of a deeply unjust system, we should note the words of Audre Lorde, “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Corporations are buying foreclosed homes in the suburbs faster than anytime in recent history; this buoys the market, and results in vast stretches of largely unoccupied housing. If there was a government stipulated incentive to sell these homes to Black people, say if African Americans in urban centers were given some kind of voucher for home ownership in the suburbs, the result could be a huge exclusionary movement of the Black community that may ultimately lead to a net financial loss. Even if there is no reparations and simply a well intentioned movement to increase Black ownership, the result may be a loss. Rates of the virus in urban areas will soon be surpassed by rates of the virus in suburban and rural backwaters. Meanwhile, suburbs have been losing value compared to urban cores. Home ownership has been less and less a percentage of total wealth compared to civic access, education, all of which can be maintained by living in a vertically integrated virus free urban center. This can be measured by the extremes of wealth inequality in America. 65.1% of Americans own their own home, with, in 2018, a median home value of $217,600. However, the bottom 50% of Americans own only 1.6% of total American’s net worth in 2019. The fragile commodity character of suburban urban design, its nimby’ist inclination, the movement to create tiny houses to house “the homeless,” the rising cost of government upkeep for suburban areas, and the rise of home sharing apps in the suburbs for cheap home rentals; all work together to create a perfect storm for some suburban collapse. In the coming years, urban core areas may be largely accountable zones where contact tracing and “in real life” person to person interaction are the norm, while the suburbs may be increasingly limited to isolation and app facilitated digital work and play. Selling unoccupied glut housing stock en masse in the suburbs would likely lower value over all, as more housing would suddenly be on the market. Not to mention it may instigate “white flight” from these areas. The result would almost certainly be a scheme of the likes of “block busting” in the 1960s, when banks bought houses in urban ghettos and re-sold a high priced “American Dream” to African Americans. After a few years of outsourcing and massive loss of jobs in these areas (already it sounds familiar); the result was foreclosures, with more houses than buyers available in local markets. The result was a decrease in already low home values, more foreclosures, greater polarization of races as incoming African Americans were blamed with nation-wide trends, and the infamous “urban blight” of the 70s, 80s began. In the 1960s, the group to benefit most from these sales were the banks; history stands to repeat. Choreography of Viral Events The material design of urban spaces affects the outcome of viral events; but also increasingly, the choreography of elements within urban spaces is affecting viral events. The placement of inflammatory objects, the creation of barriers and non-access zones, and the deployment of participating parties tactically affect the outcomes of viral events. Designing with viral events is a “user experience” design process complete with measurable online tallies – clicks, views, etc. This user experience design is beyond the screen, however, and fully embodied in physical spaces. It’s a terrifying convergence of conspiracy-esque theories of America-as-simulated-hyper-real world; online “multiplayer user dungeons,” the likes of which the military has been involved in since the 1970s; online gaming worlds like “World of Warcraft” and actual urban spaces used by a diversity of people in day to day life. The wars of the 2000s and 2010s; so focused on producing political brownie points while being conducted largely by soldiers commanding drones with joysticks, have been transferred from the cities of Afghanistan/Iraq/Colombia to the USA. The aim of the “game” is still the same: produce viral events of political valence and consolidate power. Agonistic moments of encounter in dialectics of opposition are what go most “viral.” Deployment of police or armed guards are inflammatory enough that protesters assemble as much to protest the presence of the guards as the guards assemble to “control” the protesters. The result is likely a use of force – because force is present to use: force appears to be supply driven in this system, like constructing highways or housing: an “induced demand” of opposition. Particularly for this reason, it is unfortunately possible to assemble a design statecraft “toolkit” of viral events: Deployment of armed personnel Placement of throwable items such as bricks Deployment of looters to break open shops Creation of no-go zones to bait and control movement Placement of objects, explosions, pyrotechnics All of this adjacent to inflammatory statues or sites Giving a green light to particular bands of looters justifies the presence of law enforcement, which intensifies the chance of violent exchange with people who would otherwise be peaceful. As has been documented at Black Lives Matter protests, masked white men have come to peaceful gatherings, break open a door or window to a store, and leave. In many cases it has been barricades of young women of all colors who have been defending local businesses from looters of this kind. Peaceful protesters have gone out of their way to defend police vehicles from being trashed. The list in the “toolkit” above are all polarizing and inflammatory elements designed to create disarray and lead to martial law. They present the use of force, or threaten force to “overcome” an apparent conflict, and in the process they catalyze violence. Equanimity in design: Integration without Exclusion The opposite effect requires a fluid and open field-condition4, something that might be likened to a forest. A forest condition has innumerable small glades, openings for peaceful exchange, as well as vertical and horizontal flow between all parts. The forest-field is not only fairly rhizomatic, it is cryptographic. But we should we wary that when data flow is entirely encrypted in the body, the result may be silencing. We cannot impose this forest condition; it must grow over the course of generations. With the current end-of-days aesthetic there is a constant push for immediate solutions at hand. To allow the forest condition to flourish requires, by contrast, accepting what we have, looking at the intergenerational structures around us and caring for our context in full complexity. Acceptance means having the courage to respect without the need to justify through use. Let’s begin at the intersection of the biopolitical and the bioregional: Where are the areas of our cities and countries where people are most at risk for deportation? For illness? Police brutality? Addiction? Abduction? Removal? Incarceration? Murder? Where are areas most at risk for environmental exploitation? Clearcuts? Poisoning air and water? Mining? Fracking? Pipelines? Oil spills? Nuclear waste? These are often the locations of our most stigmatized neighborhoods, our tent cities and self built housing; our indigenous, out-of-work-migrant, and displaced communities. Acceptance and incremental improvement of life here is far from radical – because these are, in fact, our cultural and spiritual centers. Already in our viral theaters, we have seen millions march on behalf of Black Lives Matter and we are beginning to see a “wall of veterans,” “wall of moms,” and many others stand up against masked, violent, “federal agents.” Now, more than ever, the social and environmental almost entirely converge. The age of the anthropocene is upon us; we are the environment: the site of our viral events is where we call into being new national and global narratives. These hotspots are the places where it is most courageous to say Water is Life and Black Lives Matter. Footnotes ↓ 1.

Rethinking Urban Policy as Pandemic Recovery Posted on September 4, 2020 Click image to see full manifesto. This entails a significant amplification in the participation of private and public partners to make this a reality and not an aspiration. It is time for ambitious political initiatives and unwavering support of our civil society to bet for us, for a prosperous and equitable future for all communities. We must advocate for our collective future continuously, even if these attempts may fail at first, because we must prioritize the legacy of our city, New York City. Food Access + Public Space Delivered Meal kits for Food Insecure Households Food insecurity is an issue that affects about 14.9% of New Yorkers. Food pantries and soup kitchens, with donations from surplus produce or uneaten restaurant meals, feed pre-prepared meals to those who otherwise would miss a meal every day. We believe that a post Covid-19 food cycle could also directly provide fresh foods to food insecure households. As part of this new food cycle, fresh produce and packaged products can be packaged as meal kit boxes to be distributed to households in need. This will ensure that communities have fresh and nutritious foods on hand. Furthermore, it will lower the cost of refrigeration and storage in food banks. Community Fridges Community-based refrigerators placed in community-designated publicly accessible spaces can serve as a redistributive form of handling excess food at a community scale. Food insecurity throughout the city has grown more pronounced during the pandemic, where nearly 15% of the city’s population already was subscribed to food subsidy programs prior to the pandemic. Therefore, when nearly 30% of national food “waste” actually comes from within our fridges, a community-oriented neighborhood fridge grants a second life to food buried in the depths of our fridges. Zoning for Public Spaces Current NYC zoning rules are a product of policy experimentation that can be traced back to ambitious government-mandated projects in the 60’s and 70’s. The Quality Housing Program, for instance was first introduced as “Zoning for Housing Quality” in 1975, in direct response to the shortcomings of the 1961 zoning code that had favored the rise of uncontextualized tall buildings within a quantitative logic that defined standards of living. Given the dire need of the city at that time, to attract capital investments, it proposed an alternative that focused on qualitative aspects that defined a new standard of living which considered light/ air, open space, and reduced parking. To do so, it called for the need to advocate for the “integrity of neighborhoods” by using FAR bonuses as an economic means to incentivize a new “basis for a rational and constructive future.” However, COVID-19 has challenged the understanding of what “quality housing” truly is, as strict confinement measures have made us reflect on the necessity to create and preserve public spaces near to where each one of us as spaces of urban respite. Post-Covid 19 NYC must redress the Quality Housing Program to expand and include the funding and maintenance of immediate public spaces as a requirement to qualify for an FAR bonus. It is important to understand that FAR bonuses should not only benefit a particular and singular development, but they must enhance the overall quality, or ultimately, a renewed “integrity of neighborhoods” through investments on public spaces. Climate Action Support the “Renewable Rikers Act” Communities in the South Bronx, North Brooklyn, and Jamaica, Queens have endured the burden of waste infrastructure for decades. Chronic diseases like asthma and other respiratory diseases make them targets for illnesses like COVID-19. Migrating these toxic waste centers out of densely populated urban areas will reduce the number of people affected by its pollution. Rikers Island, now zoned to prohibit the land for correctional facilities, presents a great opportunity to house waste and energy infrastructure. Supporting the package of bills known as the “Renewable Rikers Act”, championed by Queens Council member Costa Constantinides, supports the opportunity to transform Rikers Island into a green infrastructure hub. More importantly, it is an opportunity to improve air quality in environmentally burdened communities. Transportation Expansion of multimodal access to public transportation Create an extensive multi-lane protected bike lane network that covers all five boroughs and connects users to the public transit network. The new lane network will accommodate a new shared ebike and electrical scooter program for trips over 10 miles. This will alleviate rush hour crowds in trains and buses while providing a reliable transportation option for essential workers. Travel mile limit can be shortened during night hours, to ensure that people have a secure commute option. Additionally, buses and trains will be equipped with a cargo cart to transport personal bicycles safely, without disturbing passengers in crowded carts. Housing Community-Oriented Affordable Housing As NYC, government and electorate, continues to pursue and implement expansive and diverse affordable housing policies through private and public incentives, it is imperative that these policies stipulate decisive rules that not only regulates and incentivizes the supply of affordable housing, but also ensures a continued tenure of long-term residents and families in their own neighborhoods. These new policies on affordable housing should mandate that percentages of newly built affordable housing units must be assigned to long-term at-risk residents that may have been evicted or are threatened to be displaced by higher rents in the neighborhood. A quarter-mile radius should be drawn around newly built affordable units to define a new contextualized catchment area, which enables and prioritizes existing residents within this radius to apply for affordable housing. In this way, the character and presence of the neighborhood will be preserved. Neighborhood Specific AMI Calculation The AMI is an income number used to determine eligibility to affordable housing in New York City. It is a state-wide calculation provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Local residents, who face displacement to increase rents, have argued that the AMI does not represent accurately the income composition of particular neighborhoods. Therefore, the AMI sets up an inflated income figure that makes new affordable housing units unaffordable to local residents. What if AMI calculations were made at a smaller scale, made more neighborhood specific? This will provide a clearer sample of the economic realities in which a new affordable housing project is planned to be built, and will ensure that local residents have the opportunity to inhabit the new housing units. Labor Fair Labor Protection To this day, “essential workers” are not receiving a fair “living wage.” However, recognizing that this minimum standard has not yet been mandated, it must be understood that a living wage only covers essential “living costs,” such as, housing and transportation. That is, a living wage will allow you to only get by, as it does not account for any residual income necessary to generate wealth or securitize a personal “rainy day fund” that would protect “essential workers” against economic downturns. A post COVID-19 future must mandate a fair living wage that also includes a monthly stipend that can be allocated towards a secured “rainy day fund.” Healthcare Public Health Crisis Protocols At the peak of the pandemic, public and private hospitals saw a disproportionate rise of incoming patients with COVID-19. Working as two separate entities in the same city, private hospitals could not extend extra care to public facilities most affected by COVD-19 as there were no well defined mechanisms that enabled them to effectively cooperate and collaborate. A health protocol must be in place that allows for a percentage of resources to be shared during “state of emergencies,” with the support of private, state and federal funds. Hospital personnel could be voluntarily reallocated to hospitals in-need, and/or sections of hospitals could be pre-designated to be adapted to exclusively address public health concerns deemed to be a “state emergency” at any given time. Economic Recovery Business Co-op Small black businesses have been hard-hit by the economic stronghold brought by the pandemic. Access to Small Business Administration (SBA) emergency funds have proven to be difficult or impossible for businesses who are deemed as “unbankable” by traditional commercial banks who distribute SBA emergency funds such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This is where funds distributed by community development financial institutions (CDFI) have the capacity to reach financially underserved businesses who otherwise would not be prioritized to receive emergency funds in a time of crisis. As small black businesses continue to struggle to pay their lease or pay employees, the cooperative model comes to mind. If there is strength in numbers, perhaps creating a business cooperative model would strengthen community businesses ability to secure financing and survive economic uncertainty. This model will recognize a conglomerate of small businesses as a cooperative with the capacity to own retail spaces that they as shareholders can operate from. The operating costs would be distributed amongst all shareholders and a percentage of the profits would be distributed as a bonus for each individual business. Loans will be acquired as a cooperative to benefit even the most economic distressed shareholder. Jennifer Pehr ▷ Envisioning a Recovery That Can Shape New and Urgent Action to Slow Climate Change Posted on September 4, 2020 COVID-19: Can Our Behaviors Be Changed for the Good? NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) pollution monitoring satellites have detected significant decreases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China. Throwing in the towel on urban density to curtail the spread of Coronavirus is a colossal mistake. Density on its own is not to blame for the spread of the virus, and its counter urban forms – sprawl and suburbanization – can contribute to and exacerbate a slew of other environmental and public health crises that continue to rage despite a lack of top-of-the-fold coverage. Chief amongst these is climate change. Rather than rushing to redesign cities in six-foot increments, civic leaders, community stakeholders, and urban planners should think holistically about shaping a future that is resilient to challenges both known and unknown. Every conversation I have had since February to present has started with (or is engulfed fully by) talk of coronavirus. In less than half a year, various governments’ attempts to prevent the virus’ spread have changed the lives of millions, if not billions, and infection and death have wreaked havoc on health care systems, terrified families, and sent economies into a murky future. Of course, this is not the first time cities on a global scale have been impacted by mass public health crises. While few of us alive today lived through the Spanish Flu pandemic of the early 20th century, many of us remember first-hand the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2004, the Influenza A subtype H1N1 in 2009, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and Ebola that ravaged countries in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. As city planners, we are an optimistic bunch — we plan, design spaces, and formulate policies that might take years, decades, or even centuries to come to fruition. Our plans need to be strong enough to manifest the convictions that underpin the work yet be flexible enough so that they do not become redundant, counter-productive, or worse – harmful, by the time they are realized. Solving for what is known against what we don’t yet know is not a straightforward equation, and often people only focus on the former without considering the latter. This approach is reactionary and potentially counterproductive, especially as societies and governments around the world face slowing the spread of infection in the near-term (with strategies such as reduced travel and social distancing) while envisioning long-term approaches to address future outbreaks when we still know so little and have only been dealing with COVID-19 for a relatively short time. Density Alone Does Not Spread the Virus Urban density often is blamed (incorrectly) for the spread of coronavirus in New York City. Watching the nightly news throughout the spring and summer of 2020, I understand how people can form this misconception. But as an urban designer with an academic background in public health, I am reminded of the legacy density in cities has played in the spread of infectious diseases (the field of public health was born out of the horrible conditions endemic to the urban poor of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and urban planning has often sought – while sometimes failing – to improve the lives of people living in urban areas). And as a person who grew up in the sprawling suburbs of the southern United States, I am familiar with those who lament dense urban living, such as Thomas Jefferson, who in 1800 said, I view great cities as pestilential to the morals, the health and the liberties of man. True, they nourish some of the elegant arts; but the useful ones can thrive elsewhere; and less perfection in the others, with more health, virtue and freedom, would be my choice.”1 Indeed, suburban life in the United States, especially since after World War II, has proliferated across America and is one of the country’s most recognizable exports. Single family homes, yards, two-car garages, and cul-de-sac developments have given space to generations of families of a certain socio-economic status looking to escape the intensity of urban life. But this has come at a social, economic, environmental, and health cost, from redlining and discriminatory housing policies to economic homogeneity, miles of concrete roads, impermeable surfaces, and cars, cars, cars. The rate of lifestyle disease growth – such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity – have been growing for years. As coastal cities continue to grapple with the profound impact of rising sea levels, many are finding their natural protective barriers transformed from absorptive materials (the bayous of Louisiana, the Everglades of South Florida, the natural coastline of New York City) to impermeable surfaces for urban development. For all the challenges facing the modern New Yorker – long commutes, crumbling infrastructure, expensive housing, socioeconomic disparities, etc. – people continue to move to cities and not just because many of them appreciate the elegant arts. For many, cities present real opportunities for education, economic advancement, intellectual pursuits, culture, social connecting, and diversity. Another positive benefit of living in New York City is a higher life expectancy, which is 2.5 years higher than the rest of the country. While density may have been part of the spread of infectious diseases of the past, to blame urban density for the spread of COVID-19 is not backed by data. In mid-2020, the highest death rates have been found in areas where populations display other health, economic, and racial disparities. Early in the virus’s initial spread in the US, a small town in Georgia has the highest case rate for infections in spring 2020. Many residents on Native American reservations, a long-marginalized population with significant underlying health and economic disparities, are experiencing high rates of infection as well. And in New York City, which in the first half of 2020 was the hardest-hit city in the world by number of reported coronavirus deaths, the spread of the disease is not distributed equally across the five boroughs. In New York, the data show that people with comorbidities (the presence of at least one additional health condition) fall ill at a higher rate, which in mid-2020 is a predictor for where in the United States the disease might hit next. Data also shows that collocations of other conditions such as household crowding, poverty, race-based segregation, and workforce participation help explain cluster locations of the outbreak. While epidemiologists, public health professionals, and leaders continue to investigate how the disease spreads, how testing can be safely and accurately increased, and how an effective vaccine can get out to market, planners, designers, and elected officials need to consider methods that will slow the spread in the short-term against how people should or could live, work, and thrive in the future. These planning measures must also account for other issues cities face, from disparities in educational access to safe streets to adaptive measures needed to accommodate climate change. Coronavirus and Potentially Positive Changes in Air Quality By now many have seen the map tracking air pollution in China during the first six-week period of the country’s quarantine. The shutting down of travel and the curtailment of industry dramatically cut the amount of nitrogen dioxide (a greenhouse gas) in the air. This measurable reduction in emissions is not surprising. But the degree to which pollution was reduced is especially significant in China, the second largest contributor to emissions from air travel (the first is the United States). Similarly, after quarantines were issued in many southwestern cities in the United States, many places saw significant reductions in nitrogen dioxide (Los Angeles saw a 31% reduction, while the San Francisco Bay area saw a 22% reduction). Unfortunately, it is likely that as the threat of infection gets under control and restrictions ease, the economy will open to industry again and travel will come back online, thus negating any reductions in greenhouse gas emission. But does it have to be this way? Cities throughout history have been sized based on transportation technology and the distance that can be traveled by that technology, be it upright on two feet, on an omnibus or streetcar, in a private vehicle, by boat, bicycle, or on a subway. The car has been the most influential mode of transportation on 20th century city form. Urban environments have followed suit, evolving from intimate communities navigable by walking and public transportation to freeform amoebas sprawling across landscapes traversable via private cars on ten-lane highways. Similar to the ease of local mobility provided by cars, air travel has drastically changed global accessibility. Over the past several decades, the relative decrease in the cost of air travel has led to an amazing amount of domestic and international mobility for those across the world (who can afford it). Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for 14% of total global emissions by the economic sector. While air travel accounts for a small percentage of overall carbon emissions, predictions show that by 2050, it will account for 25% of the carbon budget (the amount of emissions allowed to keep the world within the 1.5 degrees Celsius rise from pre-Industrial Revolution levels). Emissions related to transportation are also contributing factors to respiratory infections and chronic diseases. For example, the South Bronx has one of the highest asthma rates in New York City. It is also a neighborhood ringed by three major highways that carry a large amount of vehicular traffic throughout the city and region. Issues that impact neighborhoods and communities rarely occur in isolation – be it elevated asthma rates, other public health conditions, available housing stock, access to quality open spaces, economic opportunities, or decent grocery stores. They are interrelated. And because they are interrelated, our visions and planning for the future of the built environment cannot be from any one perspective nor address a single problem independently from what else is happening in the area. New Yorkers should carefully and accurately understand the intersections of all the issues our city faces – where, how, and why coronavirus is spreading in the neighborhoods showing the highest infection and death rates, understand the pre-existing conditions in the built and socioeconomic environments that are contributing factors, study the collocations of other risk factors – and then create visions, strategies, and actionable plans that address the future holistically. Then What is Next? As of late summer 2020, New York City has been tremendously successful in reducing the transmission and immediate threat of death from coronavirus. But as the debate around how to safely open city schools and the economy continue, careful thought should be given as to where investments in industry are made, how we can hold onto the positive changes made during quarantine, and how future interventions will impact other issues the city is addressing. This will be a critical step to building not just a safe place for New Yorkers but a resilient city in the face of all our future challenges, both known and unknown. For example: streets and sidewalks, the single largest public space in New York City, need to remain open and flexible, both in the short-term to provide people a safe distance to move about their neighborhoods and in the long-term to create comfortable pathways for people separate from cars and bicycles. Investing in the public realm of sidewalks is an investment in community, people, and their health, and simultaneously creates alternative modes for circulation and movement, which can help reduce the number of cars on the streets. Another example is access to reliable internet. Quarantine has shown how critical digital infrastructure can be is staying connected, for school children to learn, and for those who are able to work remotely to do so. However, internet and WiFi are not equally accessible across the city. Stable and affordable WiFi access is critical for people whose jobs allow them to work from home. This is also a key piece of infrastructure to support remote learning and communication. Third, while public transit is still operating at a significantly reduced rate (as of summer 2020), in the future I believe it will once again be the veins through which life in New York flows. Investments to expand access to the system will provide connections across the city (including in transit-poor neighborhoods), help keep cars off the street, reduce carbon emissions, and increase necessary redundancies in transportation systems. In times of crisis, saving human life is paramount, but we cannot forget nor forgo our other emergencies. Recognizing interrelated issues and addressing them in concert with one another will create a more resilient and equitable New York City in the future, and such a perspective will help develop part of the vaccine that strengthens our city in the face of future crises.

Redesigning Togetherness: Reflections and Predictions for Cities Posted on September 4, 2020 For the initial Call for Ideas to imagine city life after the coronavirus pandemic, West 8 created an initial collection of four images – two reflections, and two predictions – on how city life was adapting and rising to the challenges of the Post-COVID world. From the introduction of new safe limits, our personal health changed the way we looked at personal space. Makeshift working environments became commonplace as we moved our offices inside, only able to communicate via drifting islands. In response, several cities around the world began to undertake initiatives to bring safety into their public spaces. Designated circles began being spray-painted onto parks, restaurants began private glasshouses, and benches became single-use. This ‘redesign of togetherness’ showed how we could re-program existing spaces to new needs temporarily and inexpensively, to allowing us to occupy the outside world once again. Our prediction was that, as this became more common-place, we would begin to require un-programmed spaces where nature would be in control – not time allocation or surveillance. To protect the most vulnerable in our fractioned society, the void-space (the spare where people can populate holistically) should be preserved. In the weeks following since, we have seen a great uprising in how space, the city and people are moving forward, together. One aspect has been seen by the reclaiming of the roads. The once congested streetscape can be safely repopulated by bikes, scooters and joggers. We saw that protected, adaptable spaces were essential in bringing people out of trapped islands and helped towards a decolonization of the streetscape. Vendors in densely packed cities have now expanded onto parking spaces, creating pop-up and semi-permanent parklets in the urban fabric – both brining greenery into once asphalted territories and creating recreation where only cars could rest. From this safe isolation, we hope to see communities re-growing together. Urban gardening and reutilization of landscape for urban gardening can be a powerful tool as, in the US and many parts of the world, there are still food deserts where access to local produce is highly priced and difficult to obtain. This era has brought a newfound awareness for the powers of landscape and quality urban space. For our cities to sustain life after coronavirus we must stretch the urban realm beyond the expected, carve out previously car-dominated landscapes and, together, we hope to create accessible, safe and green spaces in the heart of our cities. West 8 is an award-winning international office for urban design and landscape architecture, founded in 1987 with offices in Rotterdam, New York and Belgium.

Reimagining Shelter Posted on September 4, 2020 Marvel Architects recently performed a CPSD Masterplan on the 30th Street Shelter in New York City for DDC, where four primary principles in homeless shelter design were developed, and are presently being employed. Homeless shelters are an integral part of NYC’s social infrastructure. At best, they provide a safe and effective transition-point services for New Yorkers in crisis to find permanent housing solutions. At their worst, they exacerbate despair and promote victimization, becoming places to avoid for fear of safety, places which incite community outrage. Shelters by design are dense temporary housing models that provide access to a safe bed, food, and health and social services. Best practices pre-pandemic focused on increased interaction in social spaces to encourage self-supporting inspirational environments, where clients are active stakeholders in their own success. Caseworker offices are often clustered together to ensure maximum interaction between client and social worker. Dining and lounge areas encourage close social interactions. But these same shelter design elements have proved challenging during the pandemic. Some shelters have been compelled to relocate their populations to hotels. This is made possible due to the decline in hotel room usage. This model has helped ensure client safety from the coronavirus, but runs counter to City objectives to end hotel sites, as stated in the 2017 “Turning the Tide Against Homelessness in NYC,” and in the 2019 “Journey Home,” the six-point action plan to end street homelessness. It is expected due to coronavirus and its related economic recession, that the already rising homeless population will spike further. To avoid the need for adding an excessive amount of new shelters, it is imperative that existing shelters improve their efficacy to reduce the duration of client stays, by effectively transitioning clients into permanent housing sooner. We have a legal and ethical obligation to ensure the marginalized homeless population is not adversely affected by coronavirus more than it already has been. Housing is always the goal, but the interim emergency step of shelter is essential to reduce the homelessness crisis. In thinking of Urban Design Forum’s “City Life After Coronavirus,” we first need strategies for safely repopulating homeless shelters while pandemic health concerns persist. It is imperative these are cost effective and functional measures. Beyond this immediate need, we know whenever public dollars are spent on shelters, there is an opportunity and moral obligation to stretch those dollars. Too often shelter improvements have been piecemeal responses to emergencies, without considering, nor helping, resolve longer term goals. To this end we offer the following design guidelines outline, organized under four essential shelter design principles, which address the new concerns for sanitation and health, while also promoting best new practices for shelter design. Marvel Architects is already working with several of our clients to pilot these changes. Multiple separate entries allow for minimum overlap with clients entering and leaving the shelter. Providing outdoor plantings, furniture, and markings can ensure social distancing while waiting. Improve Security For and from Clients, Perceived and Actual Provide one-way traffic entrances where possible. This ensures minimum overlap with clients waiting for security and clients leaving the shelter facility, improving both health and security. Reconsider admission timing sequences and spaces to eliminate exterior lines on sidewalk. Where possible, provide outdoor plantings, furniture, and markings to ensure social distancing. Dedicate secure and private outdoor client spaces for improved health. This space can be used for recreation, as well as setting up safe caseworker meeting spaces. Incorporate touch-less client entry and digital census technologies to ensure less time and interaction between staff and client. Enhance Services Reduce Barriers to Success, Increase Shelter Efficiency Provide a mix of spaces, including potential quarantine spaces and Covid-19 testing services. Improvement and expansion in shelter services and their delivery including housing, legal, and employment services, health and wellness services, and computer and educational services. Where possible, encourage the use of technologies such as video calls through tablets to provide safe access to case workers. Streamline appointments and routinely clean all equipment used during interaction. Create a safe way for clients to interact with caseworkers. Larger waiting areas for safe social distancing, and private meeting rooms. This ensures the case worker’s office where they spend most time is not where the interaction with a client happens. Where possible, located these meeting rooms close to windows and in places with good ventilation. Alternatively, use 6’ table sizes or plexiglass screens to separate. Reschedule the dining system timing into additional phases, limiting the number of people in dining rooms at one time. Design for Dignity Change Mindsets Promote hygienic practices by providing sanitation stations, Infrared Fever Screening Systems (IFSS), and bold signage and communications employing best practices in health precautions such as social distancing floor markings. Increase seating spacing in public areas, limit number of beds per dorm and provide health and privacy screens Improve Architectural finishes to be anti-microbial. Employ touch-less features at doors, elevators, lighting, and plumbing fixtures. Increase the amount and types of cleaning and ensure all cleaning materials are anti-bacterial. Be sure bathrooms are well-stocked with soap, and order adequate anti-viral cleaning supplies in the event of a shortage. Integrate Community Reduce Stigma, and Encourage Altruism Design outdoor areas with flexible types of seating and appropriate seating groups that encourage social distancing. Improve exterior building appearance and provide information about best practices being enforced within the shelter. Open communication and good facility maintenance helps build support from the community. Provide opportunities for partnerships and volunteering though technology and safe in-person activities like planting vegetable gardens and dog runs. Become a neighborhood asset, serving as a resource for whatever current needs the community might have.

Healthier Models for Urban Living Posted on September 4, 2020 http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/1_DIAGRAMS-Gif.mp4 The pandemic has prompted a healthy debate and speculation about the longer term impacts on the city and urban density in facilitating the spread of the virus. Some suggest a move back to the suburbs will be inevitable. Putting aside the macro level reasons (e.g. cities’ inherent advantages with regard to sustainability, equity, the limited mobility capacity in the suburbs etc.) this is a narrow choice that is limited. For those who are able to contemplate single family living in Metropolitan area suburbs, the cost is high, and the inventory is limited. Outside of these options are a limited range of other multi-family formats. In recent years, five or six story wood-frame buildings organized around elevators and double-loaded corridors have become increasingly common in inner ring suburbs. For those who seek to remain in the City, multi-family options are similarly limited largely to elevator buildings with apartments lining both sides of windowless corridors. The predicament raises a range of questions. Might recent events open up the market to lower height/high-density models that do not depend on the shared circulation elements (like elevators, crowded shared stairs, double loaded corridors) that inhibit contact-wary New Yorkers from getting to the sunshine and outside air of New York’s streets and parks, and restrict them to the confines of their apartments? Are there alternate typologies that can achieve comparable densities that may now look more attractive relative to the current models for urban living? How can denser urban housing be designed to provide some breathing space in the daily interactions that people have been conditioned to fear in the course of the lockdown? Does the crisis present an opportunity to give a more considered look at different, and potentially healthier models for urban living? Ernest Flagg, New Law Tenement Floor Plan, 1901, Courtesey of Museum of the City of New York The adoption of many of New York’s most enduring and prevalent housing types over the last century were driven by a response to health and hygiene concerns. At the beginning of the 20th century, for instance the new law tenement was adopted as the result of legislation that was in turn a response to a lengthy campaign by muckracking journalists and urban reformers like Jacob Riis, who linked the lack of light and air to the spread of disease. Fifty years later, the “towers in the park” model was adopted to provide a relief to overcrowding in post-war cities by offering light and air while as well as increased densities. Bayard Street Tenement, from How the Other Half Lives, Jacob Riis This model was not only take up by figures like the prolific Robert Moses for New York City’s public housing program, but also by cities and developers throughout the Metropolitan area and the U.S. Both of these models originated with innovations that were crafted years before, but did not achieve wider adoption until a shift in underlying conditions and/or public sentiments prompted a change in regulatory framework or a response by the development community. Will the pandemic cause a sufficient shift in attitudes that it will spur healthier models for urban living? If so what are the elements that might be called into question? Will this spur an acknowledgement by city-dwellers and developers of the drawbacks of current prototypes? Are there affordable typologies that do not rely on an elevators and double-loaded corridors, but instead, provide direct access to the outdoors and the public realm? http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2_TYPICAL-BLOCK-Gif.mp4 To illustrate the possibilities, we have developed three scenarios for a typical New York City block. The two midblock scenarios propose alternative typologies that challenge current development norms. While these alternative typologies may at first appear unlikely for New York, both in fact have roots in a proud, but sometimes overlooked New York City tradition of experimentation and innovation in housing. All three scenarios balance the need to prioritize health and wellness and commercial viability. And while the issues raised by the pandemic were the impetus for the investigations, we believe this moment brings with it an obligation to address larger changes – in demographics, living patterns, and the environment, as well. Farewell to Hallway Claustrophobia: New Life for the Single-Loaded Corridor http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/3_SINGLE-LOADED-Gif.mp4 The single-loaded corridor housing typology introduces natural light and ventilation to the apartments, and to the circulation corridor, as a way to integrate some of the most attractive and healthful qualities of the detached home into apartment buildings. To achieve the efficiencies of the typical double-loaded corridor, single-loaded corridors are proposed on every other floor, in conjunction with through-floor duplex apartments, or stacked ‘maisonettes’ (commonly used French term for “small house”). Outdoor Corridor, Riverbend Semi-exterior Housing Corridor, the Netherlands More commonly found in Europe, the single-loaded corridor with duplexes has also been used in notable projects in New York City, such as Riverbend in Harlem, designed by Davis Brody which opened in 1967, and the Eastwood and Westview apartments on Roosevelt Island, designed by Sert Jackson, which opened in the mid-1970s. Westview Apartments Roosevelt Island Since the 1980’s, the introduction of accessibility codes and changes in demographics appeared to eliminate the advantages of stacked maisonettes. The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1991, required a bedroom and full bath on the entry level, increasing the size of the upper level floor plates, and putting the type seemingly at odds with the trend toward smaller households. We believe that revisiting stacked maisonettes in the post-COVID era may suggest new relevance for this typology, accommodating non-traditional households and new patterns of living and working from home. Entry-level bedrooms can accommodate live-in caregivers, elderly parents, and extended families, etc. Larger floor plates on the upper level can allow for home offices, or more flexibility to accommodate unrelated roommates. The single-loaded corridor can also be combined with through-floor simplex apartments with open or closed windowed corridors for small apartments for one or two people and a common interior space or terrace on each floor. Call Outs: Single-loaded corridor allows light and air to the units and to the common hallway Visibility of the corridor from the raised outdoor entrance patio, from the kitchen, and from the internal stair to the upper duplex level allow connections between neighbors and promote safety, while enhancing a sense of community Greater connection to neighbors and the outdoors, provision of private and semi-private terraces, greater variety of double- and single-story circulation spaces, encourage inhabitants to “collectively watch out for one another without making a conscious effort” Semi-open egress stairs with light and air, where one can see and be seen, are more attractive and thus more likely to be used, fostering connections with neighbors, while reducing the passenger load on elevators Apartment Entrance ramps along the corridor raise the ground floor above the circulation space, providing a transition between the semi-public corridor and the semi-private entrance patios. Integrating double-height private and semi-private outdoor spaces introduces an economical way to make the apartments feel larger and provide a richer sequence between the corridor and the home. Entry Level bedroom can serve as a home office if not needed for an elderly parent or handicapped family member. Floor-through living: Lower and upper levels both allow for natural cross-ventilation and two sources of daylight and views Larger upper level floor plate accommodates home offices and can be fitted with kitchenettes as studio apartments within a group of units with flexible access Achieves 85%-90% efficiency depending on the number of additional units/lofts on the open side of the corridor 2. Stepping off: Reducing Elevator Overload http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/4_ELEVATOR-OVERLOAD-Gif.mp4 The other approach is to reduce the number of apartments per elevator. While limiting the number of apartments per floor is a hallmark of housing design in places like Europe, Russia and China, the drive for efficiency has typically kept the number of apartments per floor at 10 or more in the New York, a major driver in the length and oppressiveness that often associated with circulation corridors in New York City apartment buildings. While the fear of overcrowded elevators and elevator lobbies may pass with the pandemic, this has never been one of the more humane aspects of New York City apartment living. London Terrace This model organizes five apartments around a donut circulation scheme, allowing for floor-through units and introducing natural light to the elevator lobby – always one of the more fraught spaces for apartment dwellers. Designed for a common 100’x100′ lot NYC parcel. While reducing the number of units sharing an elevator core may seem antithetical to the never ending drive for efficiency in New York City apartment design, this model, which could be envisioned as a basic building block for redevelopment on a larger scale also has roots in New York residential design tradition, most notably the magnificent London Terrace Towers in Chelsea. Key Features: Minimize number of units per floor Generous elevator lobby opens out for light and fresh air Wider corridors together with entry recesses provide additional areas for passing neighbors. Dead ends are minimized to provide multiple directions of circulation for alternative routes Directional entry vestibules for ingress and egress Multiple lobby entrances to larger buildings for optional circulation route alternatives Clear visibility of stairways from building entrances for alternative vertical circulation possibilities to reduce elevator capacities and encourage physical activity Floor-through units Donut circulation eliminates dead-end corridors Spacious entry lobbies to allow for wider areas of circulation, allowing public spaces to function as places for gathering and collaboration. Efficiency: 75% First Steps Forward: Incremental Improvements to the Typical New York City Apartment Building http://urbandesignforum.org/wp-content/uploads/5_FIRST-STEPS-GIF.mp4 The third scenario, using a 100’200’ end block site demonstrates how the concepts included in the two alternative typologies can easily be incorporated within the conventions of a typical New York City development scenario: Introducing a second core to reduce the number of apartments sharing an elevator, Providing choices for apartment dwellers to reconfigure their needs for space as their circumstances and family structure evolve, Bringing natural light and air to the circulation corridor, and Improving access to daylight and cross-ventilation in the apartments while allowing for more generous private outdoor space and rooftop gardens that can help foster a resilient food system.

Un-designing Isolation: New Forms of Living Posted on September 4, 2020 How do we retrofit or transform these environments to perform and serve diverse populations now that many people’s living and movement patterns have been drastically changed, with many confined much more to their immediate homes? These new patterns we believe will have a lasting impact. Social isolation has been an issue amongst many low income, elderly and multi-abled groups before COVID-19. One thing that needs to be re-imagined is our relationship to public and private space – where these spaces are, and what form they take. How can this relationship be rethought in certain contexts? For one, we think that if folks can’t get to the public space, then the public space should be brought to those who need it. We have three projects that we feel are underscored by this crisis to unpack this issue at three different scales. 1) Side by Side Cleveland, Ohio (2019-ongoing) mixed-use accesible housing grand prize, ZeroThreshold design competition We start with a new form of mid-density housing which is imagined as an intergenerational, multi-abled living prototype that can connect to underused lots to form public amenities. The potential for this cooperative, semi-public / private model to aid public health in the post COVID-19 realm has underscored the urgency for such a type to be explored further. SIDE by SIDE proposes an accessible urban prototype that incorporates communal cooking, gardens, and learning. Designed for inter-generational living, this project utilizes the prototype’s concept to transform an empty double lot and adjacent vacant lot into a mixed-use project designed to combat social isolation and provide an innovative new accessible living typology. Substandard housing, lack of access to green space, and lack of social connectedness affects a wide variety of neighborhoods and demographics, including Old Brooklyn. Rather than tackle these issues in isolation, SIDE by SIDE offers a holistic design to address and improve accessibility and community-based issues faced by both the alter-abled and able-bodied alike. The siting of this prototype – three lots located at the transition between the neighborhood scale and the retail/light industrial scale offers an opportunity to bridge the two and bring people together. These urban “edges”, common in many cities, become the point of departure of the project’s two primary components: 1) the community park/semi-public zone, and 2) the mixed-use living building with rear private garden. 2) Back-Lot Urbanism Newburgh, New York (2018 -) A concept of semi-communal infrastructure that corresponds with typical back-yard configurations in a diversity of urban/suburban settings. For post COVID-19 living, the potential for neighbor-to-neighbor infrastructures such as this might take the place of regular outings to restaurants and bars – and again, help to combat social isolation of the elderly and less mobile. This speculative exploration as part of ongoing research which seeks to unlock untapped architectural potential in the Hudson Valley at multiple scales. Newburgh, NY has a contained urban center which acts as a microcosm of urban blight affecting much larger cities such as Detroit or Buffalo. However, decades of economic de-investment have recently yielded to signs of urban renewal and experimentation. Back-lot urbanism attempts to exploit the latent architectural, economic, and social potential of the tree-filled interior blocks that make-up the majority of the residential urban core. A partially shared infrastructure of raised platforms could serve as a space for communal programs, such as cooking spaces for both residents or food-tourism. Access points to the street frontage could provide some presence on the front lots. The proposal situates itself within the challenging, but evolving landscape of collaborative investment and architectural language at the scale of the block and neighborhood. 3) Props for P.O.P.S New York, NY (2018 – ongoing) publication research / site-specific performance Finally, our urban “public” spaces will need to be re-imagined. Many of these spaces have been underutilized and undeserving the people for decades. Our re-imagining of various fragmented and underutilized public and semi-public New York spaces as a more continuous civic realm might actually go from fiction to reality in a post COVID-19 paradigm, as city streets are reconsidered and space for safely gathering and eating in groups will require larger, re-designed public fabric. This project is concieved of as an architectural response to the question of critical forms and spaces of performance today. Props for P.O.P.S. are a set of instructions for producing flash-architecture in ‘public’ space. Within the context of an ever-increasing number of ‘sanctioned’ performance spaces in cities like New York, this project aims to question and challenge the expectations of these spaces and their permissions, while also questioning notions of the public and “public” space in the city. The instructions are generated for and by specific sites, each a type of “privately owned public space”. The performance is a collective act to produce a topographic ‘drawing’ that will unfold through the movement and sharing of participants. Using the “stuff” of the city – a scarf, an umbrella, a yoga mat – the ground is temporarily redrawn and transformed by a new terrain of shared/gifted materials. Misreading of the instructions is expected, even encouraged.

Houselets utilize existing urban infrastructure to create safe, temporary housing for people experiencing homelessness amidst a global pandemic. Traditional homeless shelters have proven incompatible with this emergency while the demand for a solution has only increased. The situation in New York feels particularly urgent as the typically 24-hour subway is now closing overnight for cleaning. That change came just a day after local authorities referred to the increase in people sleeping on trains as “disgusting.” It was a disappointing thing to hear. While we, of course, understand wanting to protect frontline workers and public transit employees, it is misplaced disgust without solutions. It’s clear that no one wants to be in an overcrowded shelter right now, but alternatives are limited. This served as inspiration for Houselet. Drawing on the parklet model, which has become a popular strategy for expanding public space, Houselets occupy existing parking lanes and are designed for quick and easy installation, transition, and eventual removal. As far as where Houselets would be built, we know that the pandemic has prompted an exodus from urban centers. This has reduced the number of cars and created an opportunity to repurpose parking spaces for the deployment of essential shelters. To mitigate cost, construction time, and disruption to existing city systems, Houselets tap into widely available existing urban infrastructure. Connecting Houslets to fire hydrants provides clean running water for shower and sink facilities in each unit and improves access to sanitation, which is critical during a health emergency like this. Electricity in Houselets is provided by tapping into the existing streetlights that are readily available across most major cities. And finally, in an effort to bridge the digital divide and ensure connectivity, Houselets would be positioned in a way to provide access to existing public WiFi infrastructure, such as WiFi kiosks. After the emergency passes, Houselets may be removed and parking spaces restored. But, wherever possible, they should be converted into parklets that the general public would benefit from. The materials used to construct the Houselets could easily be repurposed to expand public space across our cities.

People over Property: Affordable Housing as the Cornerstone of Systemic Change Posted on September 4, 2020 Supportive Housing by Edelman Sultan Knox Wood / Architects – Landing Road / Reaching New Heights Residence COVID-19 reveals the consequences of New York City’s dehumanizing spatial and environmental policies. As residents, we are all participants in upholding a system of segregation, rooted in unaffordable housing and are collectively responsible for pushing people to live in landscapes of risk while providing few opportunities for health growth or upward mobility. Recovery from COVID-19 is an opportunity to resolve the chronic conditions that underlie this crisis by providing momentum for empathetic action. The City’s prior recovery efforts, from 9/11, the 2008 mortgage crisis, to Hurricane Sandy, suffered from a myopia that did not address underlying inequities in order to rebuild a better City. After 9/11, substantial tax subsidies through the 421-A program more than doubled the size of the residential community, creating housing for NYC’s wealthiest residents, while the City struggled to find locations elsewhere in the City for new affordable housing. In the aftermath of the 2008 mortgage crisis, NYC worked to stabilize construction markets while bolstering the continuation of speculative purchasing at the expense of owner-occupancy. After Hurricane Sandy, the city focused on reconstruction of prior built conditions, rather than increasing creating new housing opportunities in areas with the lowest amount of environmental risk. Housing is a human right. Access to stable housing is the foundation of robust public health, a committed and creative workforce, and engaged citizenry. Affordable housing provides every inhabitant with functional independence—alleviating the mental and financial stress associated with securing sleep each night opens up the capacity to take on better and higher challenges. A unit of housing is the currency of stability. As COVID-19 forced residential confinement, even the smallest of spatial irritations (working in a closet, children with no space to play, etc) are manifestations of New York’s residential crisis, and an opportunity to channel frustrations beyond individual circumstance and connect with the magnitude of housing needs facing so many New Yorkers and find compassion facing similar or likely greater, housing challenge. New York’s explosive growth has roots in the unstable transformation of housing from a social good to an asset class. Market prices bear little relationship to area wages. There is a dire need for a market correction that securitizes well-being. Equitable wealth cannot be not built through property sales or short-term rentals. Building ownership and management must re-center around well-being and stability: land trusts, cooperatives, and new taxes on flipping and pieds-à-terre could bring balance to the residential market. Public investment in over-leveraged buildings could create new affordable units. Every residential building should be seen as a part of a network of care. Through a shared physical foundation, multi-family housing buttresses tenants through the support system of neighbors. Common spaces bring community discourse. Spaces that allow for play, shared supervision of children, and collaboration are needed now more than ever. The collapse of small businesses and local retail, directly from COVID-19 closures, is a tragedy. These spaces cannot remain vacant. In mixed-use buildings, vacant retail spaces could be transformed into resources of public and community support institutions, such as daycare, new libraries, and incubator spaces. Prior community retail corridors must reconnect with local needs: whether it be for food, services, places for exchange or for gathering, both convenience and connection are perennially relevant. Like a public sewer system or the electrical grid, affordable housing is essential. New York City is known as the cultural capital of reinvention. This spirit of ingenuity must infiltrate the physical and political infrastructure of the public realm, as increasing access to affordable housing is the only way to end racial disparities in public health and in the economy. Empathetic use of property will bring prosperity to people. Ankita Nalavade ▷ 														 Ankita graduated with a Masters in Sustainable Environmental Systems from Pratt Institute, New York.

The Housing Livability Index: Questioning the NYC Housing Market Posted on September 4, 2020 The Housing Livability Index I moved to Brooklyn, New York in August 2016. In 4 years, I have moved to 3 apartments. This trend of short-term rentals is common for people who have recently moved to New York City. Every time I moved, I learned to look for new factors. Some were obvious such as proximity to public transport, others specific such as the size of the kitchen counter. The unaffordable housing stock makes you choose your evil. When it comes to housing in NYC, there is no way you will satisfy all your needs. Moreover, we build up a rationale for our compromised living space. At least that is what I did. I thought to myself, I am a ‘City Person’ that spends most of her time in the City. Why do I need a decent apartment with amenities? The apartment is the place where I spent the least amount of time. Despite spending almost 40% of my annual salary, I lived in the tiniest room – with one intermittently working, coin-operated – washer dryer in the basement as an amenity! Then came COVID-19, and I had to spend all my time confined to the apartment. That is when I realized: Housing in New York City is not only unaffordable, but also not livable. I started observing things that I had not considered checking during my apartment hunt, for instance, the thickness of the walls. The walls were so thin, that they did not obstruct the noise from within or vice versa. It is impossible to have meetings at the same time as my roommate. The tiny/no kitchen counter space is the rationale for New York’s ‘Take-Out’ culture. Frantic cooking to kill time during the pandemic made me realize this shortcoming. I decided to create a list of housing factors that were important to me pre and post-pandemic. In dense cities like NYC, the location of the apartment was more important than the livability of the apartment. This pandemic has allowed us to take a hard look into the housing conditions and policies of the city. The goal of this project is to collect data via a survey to understand the Change in Apartment Hunt factors (in Cities) due to COVID-19. Attached is the data that was gathered from the survey spanning 29 factors gathered from 16 different candidates. The 3 most significant factors that were prioritized more after COVID-19 were: Comfortable Study/Workspace Office Chair Access to the roof On the contrary, the participant’s priority declined towards these factors: Proximity to restaurants <1 hr. of daily commute Proximity to Public Transportation Proximity to bars Proximity to cafes Out of the 29 factors considered, only 5 factors had a negative impact, stated above and 23 factors had a positive impact after COVID-19, indicating that the participants did take a much closer look towards many aspects of the apartment search, which were overlooked before.

An Analysis of COVID Impact Based on Location Posted on September 4, 2020 The following maps display some of the effects of COVID-19 on the city and how these effects have varied spatially and economically across the city. The first two maps display COVID-19 case rate and death rate by zip code over income in order to show how income affects the spread and deadliness of the virus. The final map displays the percent change in rent cuts by submarket when compared to the same month in 2019 in order to show how the virus has affected rental prices across the city. Income and demographic data for NYC was acquired from the American Community Survey (ACS) and Covid-19 case rate/death rate data was acquired from the NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 Data repository. Since the data from the ACS was organized into census tracts, this was converted into zip codes for easy use with the city’s COVID-19 data. Overall, it is quite clear from these maps that residents of the poorest areas of NYC are also the most likely to contract AND die of COVID-19. This is very clearly displayed in the disparity between Central Manhattan and the Bronx. We see that cases and deaths are low in Manhattan while the Bronx, on average one of the poorest areas of the city, has both the highest case and death rate from COVID-19 accross the city. Rent cut data was downloaded from the StreetEasy data portal, and this metric simply represents the number of listings that experienced a price cut in a given month. Data from April of 2019 was compared to April of 2020 in order to find a percent difference. This map shows that most of the city (outside of the Bronx and the Rockaways) have experienced a significant share of rent cuts compared to last year. This tells us that COVID-19 is forcing many landlords to cut rents in order to combat the lack of demand for apartments in the city due to the virus."
29,Shelter for All: Call to Action,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-call-to-action/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. Read the full compilation of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. By George Piazza Introduction Most homeless shelters were never designed to be shelters – they were hotels, armories, single-room occupancy housing, and apartment buildings. In January 2018, the Urban Design Forum partnered with the NYC Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to develop Conscious Shelter Design (CSD) guidelines. The CSD guidelines are an opportunity to consider how to redesign and retrofit these existing buildings to function better as shelters. With the CSD guidelines, we would develop the first-ever set of design principles stating what is an effective shelter and the role of design in shelters. Rather than merely put out fires, the development of the CSD guidelines is an opportunity to reimagine these stigmatized buildings. More than ensuring that residents do not live in squalid conditions, the goal of these guidelines is to provide residents with a dignified life in shelter. To grapple with this challenging provocation, we assembled an interdisciplinary group of emerging leaders to form our 2018 Forefront Fellowship. Charged with producing the CSD guidelines, the 20 Fellows exemplified critical thinking and humility, qualities essential to producing a meaningful set of design principles. As a cohort of advocates, architects, planners, and city officials, they brought a comprehensive understanding of what was possible. Several had lived in the City’s shelter system or experienced precarious housing themselves. As a result, this group was able to supplement their technical skills with the emotional capacities needed to reveal how design can humanize shelter residents. The significance of this undertaking demanded that the Forum reflects upon its own values. What is our ethical responsibility when we enter shelters? What is the value of design in shelters? When is good design not enough? How can we create design guidelines that improve the lives of residents and staff, not burden them? And as urbanists, should we focus our energies on addressing today’s crisis, or long-term solutions to house the most vulnerable? Shelter Design As the CSD project began, we began with the question: who is experiencing homeless and why? Understanding that the buildings were not fully serving the needs of the people living in shelter, it was imperative to understand who we were serving; their needs; and their journeys to, at, and from shelter. Shelters are no longer just serving individuals who are chronically homeless, but they are also the first point of entry into the social services network for individuals and families. The homeless population today is different than the people who were experiencing homelessness decades ago when advocates won the right to shelter.1 The overwhelming majority of people entering shelter today do not match the stereotype – they are not single adult men with substance abuse problems who have bounced around various institutions before arriving at shelter. Instead, today, we are seeing more families, women, and children in the shelter system. Among shelter residents who are the head of a family with children, about 33% have a high school diploma and over 40% are employed. 2,3 In the 2018-19 school year, nearly 150,000 public school students experienced homelessness.4 The implication of this difference is profound: shelters are no longer just serving individuals who are chronically homeless, but they are also the first point of entry into the social services network for individuals and families. Rather than just providing restorative care to individuals with a history of case management work, shelters are frontline sites that need to prevent people from entering the cycle of bouncing from one City institution to another. The risk of putting families, adults, and children in old and ill-suited shelters is creating new trauma, stunting emotional development, and creating an intergenerational cycle of reentry into shelters.5 As we visited homeless shelters, we asked what it would mean to create a welcoming and pleasant environment for families, women, and children. Are the bedrooms big enough for a family with multiple children? Can family members find areas to decompress, or is everyone on top of one another? Are there cribs for newborns? Are there tables for families to eat together and for children to do homework? Unlike other building typologies with a familiar programmatic flow, like hospitals, schools, or apartment buildings, a particular challenge to homeless shelters is that the ad hoc nature of the building stock means there is not a standard or intuitive layout. While this may seem innocuous, the layout and circulation of a building can play a significant role in the ability of new residents to become acclimated to their new surroundings. If traveling throughout the shelter is confusing, distressing, and disorienting, then there is a high likelihood that residents can feel confused, distressed, and disoriented. When people leave their rooms, is it obvious where the communal area is located? Should programmed areas be located in the basement or are they better located on the same floor as bedrooms? Are caseworkers’ offices adjacent to play areas so parents can keep an eye on their kids? While it isn’t easy to retrofit or renovate an entire building to provide more rational adjacencies, simple design solutions focused on signage and wayfinding can play an important role in orienting residents to the building. A creative example of playful wayfinding signage at one shelter featured signs at heights where children could easily read, and in colors and with pictures that conveyed these were spaces to be enjoyed. The essential benefit to clearly orienting residents at shelters is that the greater sense of control and agency they can feel over the space, the more they are likely to feel in control of their lives. This is even more important to avoid stunting the emotional and psychological development of kids.6 It is also essential to consider the additional services residents would need.7 For mothers experiencing homelessness, 90% of whom have suffered extreme trauma in their lives before shelter, onsite services can be essential for providing restorative care.8 Yet, bedrooms are generally prioritized in shelters to ensure that there are enough places for people to sleep, meaning space for these essential programs and services is scarce. However, for shelters to be productive and help individuals reestablish their lives, it is imperative to activate underutilized and shared space. What onsite services need to be available for new moms and their babies? Do all shelters with children need spaces for after-school care? Are there large spaces for family counseling? Furthermore, how can we design spaces for case managers to remain onsite comfortably throughout the day? Space for and access to onsite services are essential to the long-term stability of children.9 One shelter we toured converted extra space into day-schools for infants and pre-school children. In the afternoon, adjacent spaces functioned as an after-school lounge for older children to do homework and make friends. Revealing that design can foster different relationships between staff and residents, these spaces required staff to know the children and their parents on a personal level, more than just another body needing to transition to independent housing as soon as possible. A person who has been to prison is 7x more likely to become homeless, and more than 54% of people returning to New York City from State prison enter directly into the homeless shelter system. In addition to designing for this new demographic of shelter residents, we also needed to address the reasons why people were entering shelter. The two most common reasons for homelessness today are domestic violence and eviction.10 50% of families in shelters are coming from just twenty-six neighborhoods, predominantly in the Bronx and Brooklyn.11 Furthermore, rather than dealing with the deinstitutionalization of the mental-health system, today we are facing a growing prison-to-shelter pipeline. A person who has been to prison is 7x more likely to become homeless, and more than 54% of people returning to New York City from State prison enter directly into the homeless shelter system.12,13 The journeys of domestic violence survivors, people evicted from their home, and people leaving prison, undoubtedly all demand different ethical approaches to our work and the design solutions that we can offer them. For domestic violence survivors and children, who are housed in different shelters, how can we balance the need for safety while not creating an overly securitized space? What is the safe and appropriate way to design the courtyards and playgrounds? If people are coming directly to shelter from their homes, how can we create flexible spaces to incorporate their personal belongings? What additional considerations need to be made to ensure a safe return back to the city from prison? Further exacerbating these systemic challenges, New York City is also grappling with a housing market that is increasingly unaffordable, with rents outpacing income growth for decades.14 Unsurprisingly, with families struggling to find affordable housing to leave shelter, the average length of stay in shelter is now over 400 days, compared to about 160 days in the early 1980s.15 Of all the stories about people’s journeys in shelter, this was perhaps the most challenging to navigate. For the City, shelters are not meant to be homes but a temporary residence. For the residents, shelters are certainly not their homes but a place to help them land back on their feet. Yet, when we considered that many shelter residents are spending more time living in shelter than many New Yorkers live in an apartment, it became difficult not to design shelters as homes. If residents are spending a year or more in shelter, we need to find a way to design shelters without reinforcing trauma but as places where residents can assert their agency over the space. How can we allow residents to bring more of their belongings to shelter? What furniture and materials can afford more flexible uses for residents? How can residents adapt existing furniture and space to suit their needs? How can we reconfigure how shelters operate to afford residents a greater sense of ownership in their day-to-day lives? During our research, we read time and time again that “the face of homelessness” is different than the face of homelessness in the ‘70s and ‘80s. While this proved to be true, this mentality belies one constant: today’s homelessness crisis has and continues to disproportionately impact Black and Latino people. Nearly 90% of shelter residents today are Black or Latino even though they represent only 53% of the city’s total population, respectively.16 This disparity mirrors similar statistics about incarceration rates, with Black people representing 53% of New York State’s prison and jail population, and Latinx representing 22%.17 These facts take on an increased resonance when we consider that by 2050 median Black wealth in America is estimated to be $0 and that young Black children are 3x more likely to live in poverty.18,19 One only needs to spend a few minutes, as we did, outside of the intake center where families apply for shelter, to witness that historical and contemporary racist structures are at the core of the homelessness crisis. But we also have an imperative to recognize our own limits: that many of the complicated challenges we may be hoping to solve are truly beyond the scope of the work. Many people that we spoke with dismissed the role of design in addressing the homelessness crisis, especially in negotiating centuries of racist urban policies. Sometimes, we even agreed with them. What could designers do to overcome these intractable challenges? Is it not hubris to suggest that we can design our way out of this history? Does the selection of materials, programs, or colors, not seem trivial in the face of larger structural challenges? What the Urban Design Forum wrestled with, and eventually decided upon, is that while we cannot undo historical injustices with our work, the designer’s role is neither absolved nor absolute. We have an imperative to reconsider the role of homeless shelters in the cycles of dehumanization, exploitation, and trauma, especially considering the number of children in the shelter system. But we also have an imperative to recognize our own limits: that many of the complicated challenges we may be hoping to solve are truly beyond the scope of the work. The Urban Design Forum’s Fellows and other design professionals may design humane, inviting, and dignifying homeless shelters, but we must also leverage our positions at the table to change the structural inequalities in the city so we do not simply beautify the veneer of unjust systems. Public Realm Design As advocates for urban design, the Urban Design Forum understands that the role of the designer cannot stop at the building. We must consider the public realm and the interstitial spaces surrounding shelters: parks, streets, plazas, and subway stations. Alienated and disjointed urban design surrounding shelters risks building resentment from neighbors and reinforcing the dehumanization process for people experiencing homelessness in shelter. As we are seeing with other community infrastructure, like libraries, we have an opportunity to reimagine the role of shelters in neighborhoods as more democratic, communal, and inclusive. Community opposition is usually the most significant challenge for the City when trying to build a new homeless shelter.20 Residents express fears about their safety, public nuisance, and the devaluation of their homes. At the core of this anxiety is also a sense that the shelter will tear the social fabric of the neighborhood: people will need to walk on the other side of the street, turn at different corners, walk up other blocks, and avoid accidentally talking to someone living at the shelter. To transform shelters into community assets, the City should leverage the design of the building and outdoor communal areas for shelter residents and neighbors to interact and value each other. How can we design playgrounds that are both safe for residents and inviting to neighbors? What social infrastructure can be placed at the front of the shelter to invite residents in? Where can we best site green space to benefit residents and neighbors? Can we dedicate greater resources to the building design to be a source of local pride? Who are existing community organizations that can program and activate these spaces? By reimagining how a shelter functions within its neighborhood, we can imagine scenarios where kids living in shelter or in the community are able to play together; where users can benefit from well-maintained gardens; and families can cook, eat, or talk with their neighbors at communal infrastructure. In addition to considering how the design of the public realm can benefit shelter residents and their neighbors, designers need to consider how the public realm can serve the growing population of people sleeping on the street. While the City has a right to shelter, it still has 3,000-4,000 people sleeping on the street.21 This is a similar trend across many cities like Los Angeles, London, and Paris, who have also seen dramatic increases in their street homeless or rough sleeping populations.22, 23, 24 While New York City has few tent camps, like many Western US cities, unfortunately, its public realm is full of defensive design and hostile architecture.25 Defensive design is the intentional selection of materials and forms to deter people who are experiencing homelessness from enjoying the public realm. Straightforward examples include spikes outside of buildings that prevent people from sleeping, benches with armrests so individuals cannot lie across, and walls with metal knobs to prevent one from sitting. Cumulatively, these design interventions serve to make public space uncomfortable and unwelcoming to individuals deemed “undesirable.” However, hostile architecture is not just the presence of dangerous protrusions. It is also the absence of the essential amenities that make a space public, inclusive, accessible. Invisible hostile architecture, or “ghost amenities,”26 includes the absence of chairs in plazas to sit; tables for people to eat; benches in parks to rest; and public bathrooms to wash up. Invisible hostile architecture does not physically and forcefully deter people from a space, but rather serves to devolve a public space into bare land. How can we learn from other global cities to revamp our public bathroom system? Can we design benches that can serve a multitude of needs for different users? For people experiencing homelessness, hostile architecture can limit the number of safe spaces for rest, cause injuries, and displace their presence from entire neighborhoods. Rather than security officials asking to move people who are homeless along from the street, the design serves to redistribute people subtly into different corridors of the city where their presence is more acceptable. This combination of hostile architecture and the redistribution of bodies across the city ultimately reinforces the hierarchy of human value central to determining who is and who is not allowed to occupy the public realm. For individuals walking by, the abundance of defensive design further serves to displace poverty from our conscience. To learn our lesson for this wave of hostile architecture, we need to consider what an inclusive public realm would look like. Should we set a minimum seat requirement for all parks, plazas, and malls? How can we learn from other global cities to revamp our public bathroom system? Can we design benches that can serve a multitude of needs for different users? What financial models can ensure a more equitable distribution of funding to all neighborhood parks so they can be amenitized and maintained? Beyond the design of the public realm, the same defensive mentality permeates the many private agencies managing the public realm. Private organizations, including Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), conservancies, and private security contractors, are increasingly managing the public realm. Often funded by private landowners and enterprises, these agencies prioritize perceptions of safety and cleanliness that often result in the forcible displacement of “undesirable” people experiencing homelessness. As with the shelter system, this decentralized and privatized system of public realm management makes it more challenging to standardize rules and staff training. Different parks and public plazas list different rules on acceptable and punishable behavior. Without proper training, we have staff and security contractors use violent force to enforce these inconsistent rules regulating people’s behavior. As this distinction between public and private ownership and management of land continues to blur, the most marginalized are likely to be ostracized. Conclusion As designers, it is important to consider our work’s impact on the most vulnerable residents in our city. While we can design buildings and public realm amenities that are inclusive, warm, and dignified, we must also learn lessons from design that harms, distresses, and dehumanizes people. With the CSD guidelines, we offer a statement for designers today to reimagine how we can serve people experiencing homelessness and a foundation for future designers to continue building toward a democratic and just design ethos. Yet, as we continue to invest resources into the expansion, operation, and revamp of the shelter system, we need to make sure we are not achieving short-term wins that are creating long-term challenges. Between the Federal, State and City governments, $3.2 billion is spent each year to serve people experiencing homelessness in New York City.27 How could we use this funding to create homes for everyone in the shelter system? Could the City revamp its housing policy to provide more and deeper levels of affordable housing? Can we ensure that if the shelter system expands, then we can find ways to prevent shelter providers from unduly profiting from the system?28 While design is one of the many tools needed to end homelessness, we cannot design our way out of the homelessness crisis. We must find creative ways to build more affordable and public housing. We must resolve centuries of racist urban policies, the historic role of banks in decimating communities, and the continued housing and schooling segregation plaguing our city. If we can inject a new philosophy built upon human rights and flourishing into the design of homeless shelters and the public realm, then we can begin to break the intergenerational cycles of trauma, poverty, and displacement.   References ↓ 1.

30,Shelter for All: An Interview with Jessica Katz,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-jessica-katz/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Jessica Katz, Executive Director at Citizens Housing and Planning Council, accompanies Supportive Housing in New York City. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Rebecca Sauer: How did you get involved in working on homelessness? Jessica Katz: I wanted to be a social worker or work in special education. But when I worked in special education, I cried all the time. I switched over to urban planning as a step back from individual human beings’ problems, and then I discovered supportive housing as this amazing confluence of the two things that I cared about in a way that my brain was better suited to. RS: In your current role as executive director of CHPC, what’s the most interesting part of your work? JK: I think it’s a great counterpoint to 12 years in government. I enjoyed every minute of that, but I now have more freedom to think about what I want to think about. I’m not building a plane while I’m flying it, which is really freeing and fun. RS: What are some of the things that you worked on in city government that you’re now looking at from a different perspective in this role? JK: I think the housing plan is the biggest one. When I worked at Housing Preservation & Development (HPD), I spent so much time talking about the mayor’s housing plan and how important the unit count was. I think it’s an incredibly useful HPD management tool, but it’s not a good community organizing tool, and it’s probably not even a good housing policy tool. 200,000 units isn’t a housing policy for the City of New York. That’s something where I saw my brain change so fast, to see that clearly. Anand Amin: What made the light bulb go off? Was there a certain moment after you left government that you realized this? JK: I think inside HPD, the housing plan is incredibly valuable. It was my favorite part about my job. I always knew if I was doing a good job or not, on any given day. Everyone knew what the number was and if you met the number, you knew you were doing a great job. And if you didn’t meet the number, you were not doing a great job. Everything fed that one number. Any decision we made, we thought about if it was serving the goal or not. I still stand by that. But I think we need to bottle that amazing practice and apply it towards more than just counting units. If that singular focus was were applied towards the homelessness system, we would have a very different set of circumstances. RS: So that’s a good pivot point, because our project is focusing on how we crack the nut of the homelessness crisis, which seems to be stagnating, if not worsening. How have your experiences working in finance, government, and social services come together to move the needle on this issue? JK: HPD successfully meets any unit target you give it, because there’s a system where despite the fact that a lot of the cost, timing, and human capital factors—whether it be the price of steel in China or the price of real estate in New York— are not within HPD’s control, we still meet the unit goals. An ecosystem has been created where what is good for HPD is good for the affordable housing industry. That confluence is currently under a lot of criticism, but it created a system where all the partners that are needed are moving in the same direction. And then there’s a predictability. After several decades of a housing plan, we have built a factory. We know what product we’re building: affordable housing units. We know what the product is and we know why we’re doing it. I think the homelessness sector has never managed to do that. Government is doing too much in some places, too little in other places. Government is a little bit more on an island, and it hasn’t harnessed that ecosystem to all be towards the same goal in quite the same way. There is also greater diversity of options. But even in terms of building shelters, or placing people out of shelters, which is analogous to what we do in the housing sector, there’s never been the same systemizing of it and making it mutually beneficial in quite the same way. RS: What do you think has changed in the supportive housing landscape since you started working on this issue? Do you have any predictions for how it will change over the next 5 years? JK: One of the biggest changes over the past two decades has been the extent to which supportive housing stopped being a little niche world unto itself, with its own funding sources, buildings, and developers. It really got subsumed into the larger affordable housing field. Now we’re using private debt, taxes, and bonds, and partnering with private developers. It got mainstreamed, which let us get to scale in a big way. We always said supportive housing was supposed to be about community integration. That’s still true if it’s a mental health agency buying a building and having it be 100% or 60% people with mental illness, but it’s even more true if you’re doing 10% of a 300-unit building that also has market-rate housing in it. As a social service matter, it’s created a lot more integration. As a financial matter, it created an interdependence between the supportive housing sources and the mainstream affordable housing world. This created more levers for government to say, “You can have our bonds if you do this percent of supportive housing.” By mainstreaming those financial incentives, now suddenly you have somebody who 10 years ago would have said, “What, am I going to do an HHAP project? I’m going to manage an OMH deal?” Now, suddenly they’re saying, “Well, if it gets me to the front of the line for bonds, I’ll be the biggest supportive housing advocate you’ve got.” It’s created a pretty wide constituency for supportive housing in a way that’s been positive. And it’s created a lot of new resources for supportive housing. So, I think both of those things have been largely positive changes. Supportive housing in the Bronx. Image credit: Michael Moran. RS: Do you see any negative externalities to using private debt and bonds? Or do you think it’s what we needed to get to scale? JK: On balance, it’s been a hugely positive thing. There was a core group of us who have been doing supportive housing for a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel comfortable to have everybody decide that it’s also their business now too. That’s been difficult for the supportive housing community to get used to. AA: While the net of supportive housing developers has expanded, a lot of the new projects are still generally supportive housing mixed with affordable housing. It doesn’t seem that the concept of mixing supportive housing with market-rate housing has taken off too much. Are we seeing this in new multi-family development? JK: We do a ton of scattered site, which is supportive housing mixed with market-rate housing. The affordable market-rate mix in New York City is inclusionary. Supportive housing has also been much more successful than other types of affordable housing in being located throughout all New York City neighborhoods. There are some structural reasons why this is the case. First, there were certain building types that existed in high-value neighborhoods that were only useful for supportive housing, like SROs and hotels. Second, there was never any expectation that a supportive housing project could make it through ULURP, so we were looking for private sites, as opposed to working in the neighborhoods with large concentrations of public sites. For both of those reasons, that’s also where there were large concentrations of homeless people; on the Bowery, in Hell’s Kitchen, on the Upper West Side, there were community boards that felt like, “We must do something about this.” That’s where we had the political power, a concentration of nonprofits, and building types that made sense for us. If you look at the 30-year horizon of what HPD has done, I think we do great in terms of where our units are located vis-à-vis other affordable housing. RS: You talked about the expanding resources and how we’ve been able to bring supportive housing to scale, but there are still a lot of challenges. What are those challenges, as you see them now, or as you experienced them in the past? JK: Land scarcity and cost are generic problems for all housing development, but supportive housing has these problems too. Then it has two additional challenges to manage. One is that supportive housing developers are not looking for a backup option—they’re just developing supportive housing. For other developers, they can plan to build X, but if that doesn’t work, they can just build Y, and if that doesn’t work, they could sell it to someone else who would build Z. A business person would think of all three options as equally viable. They would maybe have more expertise in one or a preference for the other or less risk tolerance for the third, but in general, they could do any of those things. For a supportive housing developer, because this is all that they do, there is less risk tolerance. If something falls through—politically, the contract, or the funding—there is not a backup plan. They also have a greater NIMBY problem than other types of housing, although that’s debatable these days. The other challenge is that you have nonprofits that are not set up for risk. The idea that a nonprofit buys a bunch of sites, accepting that a few won’t work out, is not feasible; it’s not their business model. Consequently, they don’t have the same kind of capacity as other players in the real estate market who are competing for those same sites and don’t have the same kind of concerns. I feel like it’s harder for supportive housing developers to jump in, which means that we lose development opportunities. RS: This issue of acquisition and risk is one of the bigger barriers. We chose to look at zoning, so once you find the site, how do we then maximize the building on the site? But the other side of the problem is a big one too. Are there any innovations that you’re seeing in other parts of the country or the world that we could apply here to expand our pool of resources, expertise, or production? JK: From the West Coast, we could learn about how the citizenry at large came to care about homelessness and feel like it was their job to do something about it. I don’t think we feel that same level of responsibility here and I don’t know why. Maybe because we’re bigger; maybe because we have a right to shelter, so homelessness isn’t as visible. But there’s a good example from California of both the public and the corporate community thinking that homelessness is something that they should care about. We don’t have philanthropy, we don’t have the public, and we don’t have the corporate citizens who feel like this is a main part of their mission. We have a very robust network of nonprofits, and we have a government that is more involved than anyplace else, because we are legally obligated to be, but those other pieces are missing and it is a big gap for us. RS: The other interesting thing, which is a bit ironic, is that California didn’t have any dedicated funding for supportive housing, so they needed to raise a bond, for which California law requires a public vote. Consequently, this required people to learn about supportive housing and homelessness and then feel personally invested in what they voted for. JK: Right! That would feel terrifying in New York City to have a public vote on the Supportive Housing Loan Program budget. When I oversaw it, I would have never allowed such a thing to happen. But there is something to it, there really is. RS: Are there any expansive policy changes that we could make to the affordable housing landscape? What should we consider to chip away at that homeless census number and build the units needed to house people? JK: We should make sure that we’re really making the best use of the resources that we already have so that we’re placing people as quickly as we can. I think smaller cities benefit from not having this whole apparatus around homelessness, whereas we have too much. RS: Can you explain what the VI-SPDAT is? JK: VI stands for vulnerability index. The VI-SPDAT is a 20-question questionnaire that ranks somebody from 0 to 20 based on how vulnerable they are to dying on the street if they are not given housing. It’s used to decide who gets housed first, to create a rationality for a waitlist or how we should target our limited housing interventions. It was widely used on Skid Row in Los Angeles and in places where there’s an ocean of human beings living on the street, making it challenging to know that much about them. In New York, I think we suffer from the opposite problem, which is that we have people who are stuck in 20 different systems, all of them assessing and gathering information to the point where we get paralyzed. We need to clear away some of that data collection and ask ourselves why we really need to know this information right now. We should take a hard look at the vacancy rates and placement times in supportive housing to see whether we can do better. We spend 10 weeks assessing whether person A or person B is the best fit for this unit, but that unit is sitting vacant while we’re doing that. “In New York (…), we have people who are stuck in 20 different systems, all of them assessing and gathering information to the point where we get paralyzed.” That’s not a silver bullet for a massive change. But I do think that it’s hard to talk about expanding the number of supportive housing units if we’re not being as efficient as we can be with the units that we have. RS: Envision a future 30 years from now with no homelessness. How do we get there? JK: Continuing to ask that question, and taking that question seriously. I think the backlash against people asking that question was misplaced. We should start feeling comfortable asking that question again. There were plans to end homelessness and then there was a huge backlash in the city and the country. There was a Bloomberg plan to end homelessness, which was not successful, and then people were like, “Well, that was stupid and hubristic to even say that we’re ending homelessness. Homelessness is with us forever, and shall be managed to the end of time.” I think that’s a mistake. Getting that question back into vocabulary is important because we’re at a low point of people thinking it is a reasonable question. I don’t think that that should be the case. It’s important to keep that question in our discussions and not let it be a pipe dream. Jessica Katz is Executive Director at Citizens Housing and Planning Council.

31,Shelter for All: An Interview with Tommy Newman,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-tommy-newman/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Tommy Newman, Senior Director of Impact Initiatives at the United Way of Greater Los Angeles, accompanies Supportive Housing in New York City. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Rebecca Sauer: A lot of the time we were doing this project, I was saying to my team, “Everyone In, they’re doing such amazing stuff!” So, we thought it would be perfect to hear from you! Tell us, how did you get involved with working on homelessness? Tommy Newman: When I was working in LA City Hall, I was constantly getting calls about homelessness. The de facto response would be to call the LAPD, who would just tell people to move along, because 75% of the people experiencing homelessness in LA are unsheltered. I thought, “This is stupid. Why am I calling the LAPD?” I ultimately raised $25,000 to start one community’s first-ever outreach and engagement team. In this process, I got to understand the gaps in the system and the lack of system. LA has always had strong nonprofit service providers, about 65 of them, but nobody was coordinating their work together, so each was its own little fiefdom with its own set of rules. Later, I was looking for a job, so I called up LA Family Housing and convinced the CEO to hire me as her public affairs person. And lo and behold, around 2016, we’re in the early stages of talking about a $1.2 billion bond measure to fund supportive housing in the City of LA. That passed, and everybody was excited. It was the first time ever that we had a local revenue source to build affordable housing. That’s awesome, but now we need to do the other parts of the system: outreach, short-term housing subsidies, interim housing, all of that. So, the County of Los Angeles says they’re going to put a quarter-cent sales tax on the March 2017 ballot to fund all the onsite services for supportive housing that HHH is going to build. Once the measure passed, we thought, “Oh my god, we have $4.7 billion over the next 10 years! Let’s get to work.” What became very clear very quickly though is that just having the money and just having the strategies were not enough. People were going to fight the housing; they were going to be skeptical of the solutions. United Way knew that much and they asked me to do a public education and mobilization campaign. We figured out what the strategy was and launched Everyone In in March 2018. RS: Nice! That was a lot of groundwork before Everyone In was birthed. What is your elevator pitch for Everyone In? TN: Everyone In is the engine that is driving the work of funding homelessness forward. It is not government; it is outside of government. It is a coalition of everyone, because it will take everyone to understand what the solutions are to homelessness and to advocate for them in their own communities. RS: I love that! What does that look like in terms of the groundwork? TN: We are a hybrid political campaign. I would not have been effective at launching Everyone In if I hadn’t worked in government because I adopted a lot of political campaign strategies. We had a communications campaign across the county with a straightforward message: We know how to end homelessness; it is with a permanent, stable home; we need more of them; help us. We did 900 bus advertisements that said, “Homes End Homelessness. Sign up and take action, EveryoneInLA.org.” 100 million eyeballs saw those. Then we have an event strategy called Everyone In: Stories from the Frontline, which is our entry point into our engagement model. For decades, people could only go to very contentious community meetings about a proposed building. We built a robust events program anchored in lived experiences and storytelling events. We know that stories of lived experiences alone are dismissed as anecdotes, one-time one-offs. We also know that stories exclusively of systems are either too wonky or dismissed as bureaucracy. But when you’re able to link the two together—the lived experiences plus systems—it clicks. People see the example, then they see how it goes to scale, and they’re much more likely to be supportive. Our campaign strategy is to educate folks, get them to come in at a low barrier opportunity, understand the basics, and then work through a series of trainings that gradually educate them more as their ability to be able to explain what the solutions are increases. We eventually deploy these folks back into their own communities to impact their neighbors if they’re having a conversation about what the causes and solutions to homelessness are. That’s the campaign strategy in a nutshell. And I want to emphasize the role of the community organizer. If we were just doing communications, it would be very easily dismissed as a PR campaign. The events make it more real. So now you have a place to go, people to meet, and things to see and hear. What ties it all together is that we have a team of 10 community organizers who are assigned to different regions of LA County. They’re the ones showing up at community meetings, holding trainings, and following up with somebody who signs up on our website saying they want to get involved. That’s how the whole thing gets glued together. Everyone In event. Image credit: Everyone In. RS: Of all the different strategic prongs of your approach, what do you think is the most interesting part of what you do? TN: The most interesting thing is how we weave all of them together. All three of them could exist on their own, and most commonly all three do exist on their own. There are plenty of examples of public education campaigns about homelessness, or community organizing teams working on the fight for housing. But the integrated strategy of all these things is what makes them impactful and exciting. The best example I have is a story about the 222 initiative. After passing HHH, we had 15 city councilmembers who were skeptical about building supportive housing in their low-income districts. They said, “If they’re not going to build it in over there on the Westside of LA, then I’m not going to build it in my district.” So very quickly we’re like, “Problem!” I sat down and thought, how do I reframe this challenge? Initially the goal was 10,000 units in 10 years—we’re going to end up doing it much quicker than 10 years—so, we thought, what if we divide 10,000 by 15? That’s a very common strategy in Los Angeles. Dividing something by 15 in LA is like cutting a cookie in half to give your two children. So we did this and got 666. We were like, “The 666 plan—that doesn’t sound like a good idea.” We thought how to reframe it and we looked at who we were talking about: councilmembers who will be termed out in the next three years. Okay, so let’s divide it by three. Now we have three, three-year goals with 222 units in each one of those three-year chunks. We leveraged our relationships with city councilmembers and convinced them that was doable. They passed a resolution through the City Council saying that they would support a minimum of 222 units of supportive housing in their districts. Okay, that would be a classic advocacy play. It got there, but it’s a non-binding resolution—what good is that, ultimately? So, we made a page on our website with the faces of the councilmembers and the number of units in their district approved towards the 222 goal. This was an easily digestible, public-facing tool to track progress. Then we had our organizers go to community meetings and flash this on the screen nine times to get everybody fired up about how many more units they needed. We integrated the advocacy with the communications, and lo and behold, that clicked. Now we’ve had stories in the LA Times and on local radio stations checking in on progress to the 222 goal and how different districts were doing. Just doing one of those things would not have been nearly as impactful as the integration of all of them: the communications, the advocacy, and the organizing. That’s what makes it work. Catherine Nguyen: I’m glad you brought up this 222 initiative. I’ve been listening to the LA Podcast, and they recently talked about how City Council District 12 is up for election and they have no supportive housing units in that district. How are you approaching this upcoming election and what are you doing to muster up support for that? TN: The 12th is a problem. It is the far western San Fernando Valley, so it’s way out there, all single-family ranch homes. Neither HHH nor H passed out there, so there is not a lot of support electorally. It is hands-down our biggest problem. We focus a lot of our energy on the 3rd district, which is immediately adjacent to the 12th. In the 3rd, we had a councilmember who was ambivalent, so we found three parking lots in his district owned by the City of LA, and we built a coalition of 30 people who all said, “Yes, we want these parking lots to be developed for supportive housing.” We took them in and kept working on his staff, and eventually they made the lots available for study. If we didn’t have the 222 initiative, then they probably wouldn’t have felt the pressure. But they only had 13 units on the 222 tracker and everybody kept asking them why. We said, “We’ll help you. We’ll create the cover for you to make these parking lots available. You just have to hold our hands and jump with us.” And so the councilmember did. This will be the same strategy for the 12th. We’ve been in contact with everybody who’s running. We’re going to wait and see who wins the primary, and then just squeeze them to commit to 222. We are not going to let them off the hook. We’re just going to leverage the pressure of the campaign to get them to make commitments. Anand Amin: What capacity does a councilmember have regarding supportive housing development? Do they have to sign off on these projects? TN: In the early days, they had to sign a letter saying that they supported the building in their district. And if there was not a letter, the deal could not get HHH funds. That was the real obstacle, because that gave them veto power over every building. We were able to highlight that enough times through stories in the LA Times that Sacramento said they would not support a LIHTC allocation to the City of Los Angeles if this letter requirement continues to exist. They put that condition in the annual appropriations package, which passed. The City of LA was then forced to remove the letter requirements from the HHH program. That used to be a real issue for us. Now the issue is that all votes approving the allocation of HHH funds still go through the LA City Council. The councilmember can still say they don’t support giving HHH funds to a project, but this is now done more publicly and they’d get a lot more criticism for it, but they could still pull that off. Whoever controls the purse strings controls a lot of power. To the question of what I think New York does better than us—in LA, most of our land use policy requires discretionary action, but in New York more land use policy is as-of-right. Because we have very little as-of-right, our zoning is constrained and low-density except for in two communities. The result is that the development of an apartment building in most of the city requires the support of the elected official. That is why we have a massive housing crisis here. If somebody wants to build a 60-unit building, I would assume it’s a lot easier in New York than it is in LA. RS: We looked at this zoning question a lot in our project. You see this across the country where communities use zoning as cover to control who does and who doesn’t come into the community. It’s not always about density, but about what that density symbolizes and what it would open the doors to. Do you see that in your campaign? How do you deal with people who you are educating about supportive housing but they object to it because of a density argument? TN: Land use policy is absolutely being exploited and has absolutely been used to support segregation and racist housing policies here in LA. It has for a long time. 50% of LA is zoned for single family homes. Some people will say it is because they want the California lifestyle where you can sit in your backyard and hear the birds chirping. That might be true. But it also could be that it was a powerful tool to segregate people of color out of white single-family communities. This is still an issue for us. There’s also just very little housing production. The City of LA is about 40% of the population of LA County, but it accounted for 75% of the new housing construction last year. So, the rest of the county is basically not building any housing, and that’s a problem. Interestingly, we’re not there yet in terms of people connecting the dots between our lack of housing production and the increasing homeless population. They kind of get it, but don’t totally want to believe it. And when the rubber hits the road, and that requires a little bit more in their communities, they’re not quite there yet. At Everyone In, it’s not a campaign to densify communities, because that’s not a winning message. But we are using the homelessness crisis and what people see to back into the conversation about creating more housing. It better actualizes the source of the problem and the solution. Supportive housing tracker for LA city councilmembers. Image credit: Everyone In. RS: You mentioned earlier that you think you’re going to meet the 10-year goal more quickly. Given all these constraints, I was a little surprised to hear that. Can you say more about it? TN: The idea was 1,000 units a year and we’ve already approved 5,000 units in two years. They’re pushing the money out much faster than anybody expected them to. Despite that, it is still not easy to build housing. We have made it easier to build supportive housing; there have been various streamlining ordinances that make it easier to build 100% affordable housing, which are helpful. But we have never invested this much money in this. There’s sort of a catching up that needs to happen that everyone broadly agrees with. We build in the tens of thousands of units every year, so it’s not unusual that we could pull off 5,000 units. I would say we should be building in the hundreds of thousands of units every year. RS: Could you dive into the ordinances and talk about how those came to be and what the changes were? TN: There are a couple. The Transit Oriented Communities program was passed in a ballot measure a few years ago. Voters didn’t support it because it was going to increase density and reduce parking requirements around transit corridors. They voted for it because it would create more housing for families and jobs. That was the frame that it was sold with, so people voted yes. It turned out to be helpful to expedite making what was previously not by-right, by-right in the context of supportive housing. I think at least half of the 107 supportive housing buildings approved for funding so far are using the Transit Oriented Communities program to reduce the funding requirements significantly. We also passed the Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance, which eliminated parking for the buildings, raised the threshold for discretionary review from 50 units to 150 units, and eliminated the minimum unit size. It made it easier to build the building and reduced costs because parking was really expensive. Unfortunately, that’s being challenged in court, but meanwhile the state passed basically the same thing. There have been some thoughtful efforts to reduce the barriers and costs that have helped developers build a lot faster. CN: Do you find that supportive housing is being developed on private or public land? Are there any challenges in finding land to build on? TN: Land costs here, like in New York City, are out of control. Nine times out of 10, a regular developer is going to beat out a supportive housing developer in terms of price and speed. Publicly-owned land is a key strategy for us. Out of 107 buildings, about 30 to 35 of them are on public land. It takes much longer to get all the approvals lined up for the publicly-owned land than it does for private land, so that’s why it hasn’t been more. We’re going to continue plugging away on it because while it doesn’t improve the speed, it does help reduce costs. It particularly helps to develop in higher-income communities where land costs are very high, which is a goal for us. So, the parking lot on the Westside of Los Angeles that’s worth $10 to $15 million, which would be 50% of the building cost if the building cost $25 million, would never pencil out. But, if the developer is getting it basically for free, then the whole thing works. AA: With the various public sites, are they sprinkled among different agencies that control the land? What are you finding as opportune public land in terms of who’s in control of it? TN: Lots of different entities have control over lots of different pieces of land. The low-hanging fruit is the land controlled by the Housing Department, because they are ready to make it available to an RFP for people to bid on it. Then, the city owns around 135 pretty large parking lots, many of which do not generate any revenue for the City; they’re just free parking. But those are controlled by Public Transportation, so they have to be ready and willing to make it available to the Housing Department and the City Council office has to approve it, which means that all the people who love that free parking are going to call up their councilmember and say, “Don’t get rid of my parking!” But it’s doable. Those have been the first two starting places. There are advocates who think that the City has tons of underutilized buildings that should be converted. That may or may not be true. Anybody who has been involved in creating housing will know that converting an office building into housing is expensive and complicated. So, it is not as easy as it sounds. I saw some article the other day about taking publicly-owned library sites and redeveloping them to have the library on the bottom and housing above the library. That’s a no-brainer, but maybe more complicated to put together all the stakeholders. RS: Imagine a universe 30 years from now with no homelessness. How do you think we got there? TN: Created a shit load of housing. RS: Great answer. Straight to the point! TN: And it wasn’t just publicly subsidized housing. We figured out how to adjust our land use policies and incentives to tap into the private capital market to create long-term covenanted supportive and affordable housing. I really do think if I were to try to do this exclusively through public subsidy, at $140,000 to $200,000 a door, which is what we’re doing in LA, I would need tens of billions of dollars to get there. That’s my next frontier. I’m going to keep doing the public subsidy, I’m not going to stop on that, but we’ve got to figure out how to tap into private capital and make it work.

32,Shelter for All: An Interview with Paul Lotter,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-paul-lotter/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Paul Lotter, Director of BID Field Operations for the Long Island City Partnership, accompanies Homelessness in the Public Realm. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Stella Kim: Could you tell me a little bit about yourself and your current role? Paul Lotter: I am the Director of BID Field Operations for the Long Island City (LIC) Partnership, where I oversee all operations for LIC BID, from our landscaping and winter lighting programs, to our sanitation and various other programs aimed at improving the streets within the LIC BID. A major part of this role is working with outside agencies on related issues and obstacles. Before working at the LIC Partnership, I was working at Block by Block for a year and a half overseeing the operations for six Business Improvement Districts within New York City. Prior to that, I was the Precinct Manager at the Cape Town Central City Improvement District, the largest BID in South Africa. SK: Could you talk more about the spaces the LIC BID oversees? PL: We don’t have a lot of public spaces that the LIC BID is responsible for managing. The public spaces we manage are the Queens Plaza Greenway and the Dutch Kills Green. We have a contract with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation for the maintenance of these public spaces, essentially keeping them clean and beautifying the area. If there are any structural issues with the benches or the street lights, that would be something we would attend to. There are a few other open spaces/green streets within the BID, but we are not the agency responsible for their maintenance/oversight. The public spaces that we manage are not the kind that you might have in mind, like when you go to the Flatiron District where they have a large median that they’ve turned into a public seating area with food trucks and free Wi-Fi. Our set up is slightly different. A lot of the public space we manage is centered on the bicycle lanes and horticultural beds that accompany it. There are few benches that people can come and make use of during their lunches. Dutch Kills Green. Image credit: Langan. SK: How often does the Partnership staff encounter people experiencing homelessness in public spaces and sidewalks within your BID boundary? Are there any effective strategies that the BID employs that others might be willing to try? PL: When it comes to public spaces and sidewalks within the BID, I have noticed a growing number of homeless people utilizing the space. We also notice a sharp increase in the homeless population mainly during the summer months, when there is an increase in foot traffic. Typically, I will notice them on the busiest sidewalks, where there is a lot of retail activity. Many of the homeless individuals are already known to our partners at Breaking Ground. Some of the strategies that we have employed to assist the homeless population include doing district walks with Breaking Ground to identify the hotspot areas and offer services to those individuals. Our goal is not to displace anyone, but if there is an activity that is causing a public nuisance or destruction, like public urination and defecation or aggressive panhandling, then typically we would partner with City agencies to see how we can remedy this issue. These activities can negatively affect how our merchants are able to run their businesses. SK: What has been most challenging about managing these situations? What can help BIDs and other managers of the public realm manage these challenges? PL: For me, over the years, the biggest challenge I’ve noticed is the willingness of a homeless individual to accept the services available to them. A lot of people experiencing homelessness don’t want assistance. They are perfectly happy with their lifestyle. Getting them reintegrated back into society is a real challenge. Another challenge is also education within the public realm. It is something that needs inputs from various city organizations to effectively address this growing problem. Everyone should get involved at some point if they can. SK: In addition to the services that you already are utilizing and the relationships that you have, is there anyone else that can help? Or any specific recommendations you would put forth to the City that would be helpful? PL: Research and education around this whole topic, similar to the work that you’re doing right now to come up with recommendations and publications on the whole topic of homelessness. Not only to BIDs, but to everyone. Most businesses are in urban areas. If you work in a downtown, chances are you pass someone that’s homeless or someone that’s in need. This kind of information—what to do or how to handle the situation or who to call—is something that is not out there yet. Or if it is, not a lot of people know about it. BID map. Image credit: Long Island City Partnership. SK: What does a more compassionate management of the public realm look like to you? PL: A public space that is open and accessible to all people. An area or a community where there is sufficient services available to people that are in need. That is compassionate management of the public realm. SK: What will it take for public spaces to be truly for all? We’re probing all the experts in public space management for your dream ideas. PL: Dream ideas…well, more public restrooms, certainly, there is a big need for that. If you live on the street, where do you go? Restaurants can’t be seen as the main provider of bathrooms to people living on the street – the City needs to come up with real ways to solve this problem. More open spaces for families and kids to be able to play and exercise. Perhaps more water features during the summer months. Living in an urban area, it’s important to have those spaces available to make it more inviting for its people. Having sufficient wayfinding maps and information boards would be helpful to visitors and newcomers to an area. You also have to make it accessible to the elderly and people with disabilities. When you say public space for all, that includes the homeless population, your average Joe walking down the street, visitors to the area and those that live there. SK: This is a great list. It takes different kinds of amenities and features that will reach certain segments of the population, and will combine to create a truly great space. Paul Lotter is the Director of BID Field Operations for Long Island City Partnership. He budgetary oversees the BID’s $1 million annual budget, as well as various contracts with city and private agencies, and facilitates with relevant city and state agencies and officials to maintain the highest quality conditions in the area. Prior to that, Lotter was the Operation Manager of Block by Block and the Precinct Manager of Urban Management Department for Cape Town Central City Improvement District.

33,Shelter for All: An Interview with Gia Biagi,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-gia-biagi/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. Fellows spoke with Gia Biagi while she was in her former position as Principal of Urbanism and Civic Impact at Chicago-based architecture firm Studio Gang; she has since been named the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Transportation. The following interview with Gia accompanies Homelessness in the Public Realm. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Margaret Jankowsky: Hi Gia, thanks for agreeing to talk with me about your approach to designing for the public realm, especially in relation to homelessness and areas of high civic impact. Studio Gang has worked on public realm projects in a lot of very different places, from the Memphis Riverfront to the New York City’s Neighborhood Activation Study with the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. How do you approach working in the public realm in your role as Principal of Urbanism and Civic Impact at Studio Gang*? Gia Biagi: There are lots of ways that design firms and anyone interested in the public realm can figure out what the key public policy questions are on the ground. But we try to ground our work in principles first. Those principles are thinking about local knowledge and local knowhow—what people are experiencing in their lives, the broad spectrum of folks and communities. That local knowledge is not what designers have. So we start trying to uncover that, and then you start to suss out the patterns in what people are saying, and then we check those patterns against preferences by asking folks how they would interpret the patterns that we’re seeing. When we think about who those people are that we’re talking to, we try to look through a frame of influence and stakes. Sometimes I call it the power diagram, but it’s about looking at a continuum in terms of influence and stakes. Who has high influence in making change and who has low influence? That would be the y-axis. The x-axis is looking at who has a high or low stake in the outcome. Then you start to slot who you’re talking with. Very often designers have access to people who have high influence and high stakes—that might be a mayor, that might be a client or a developer, that could be any number of people who are at the table for a lot of reasons. But what we try to do is make sure that we’re also working to listen to folks who have a very high stake but have low influence, who are not at the table. The principle of looking for local knowledge and local know-how means asking the question: who is not at the table? And how are we going to make sure that the most marginalized voices are there? That can be a check, and there are all kinds of tactics and methods you can then use. But that’s how we start to understand what the key policy question on the ground is and then what design has to do with that. As we talk about design, we’re often thinking about adaptive questions, but working in a technical realm. Experiencing homelessness is one of the huge adaptive challenges because there are all kinds of components to it. It is the fact of not having a home, of barriers to employment, of institutional racism, of redlining. All of these pieces have something to do with this adaptive challenge existing in the first place. That’s where the policy questions lie. The hard part for designers is typically that we have all these technical tools. We have technical answers, following a checklist, and if we do these things and we design the doorknobs in this way, we’re hopeful we can touch on that adaptive challenge. But we need to recognize that these adaptive challenges are generational. What you’re doing is moving a needle, not necessarily checking a box. Our approach is to try to toggle back and forth because what’s useful about architecture is that it can express at a human scale what a potential way of addressing that adaptive challenge might look like. It helps people understand the consequences of decisions they might be making. When we work with clients, we put this all on the table. A designer has to look at their privilege as a convener, to bring issues to the table that are uncomfortable and to ground the work in a set of principles like we try to do. It gives you the confidence to put issues on the table with a client who you might not think even is interested. And if you’re doing a good job of getting other voices to the table, particularly marginalized voices to the table, your work will get better. The obligations that we have as designers, ones who are interested in the public realm, is to really put those questions on the table and do what we can to move the needle. Studio Gang’s public realm projects have included the Memphis riverfront. Image credit: Thomas R Machnitzki via Wikipedia MJ: Can you talk a little bit about how exactly you engage the community members and get them to the table and get their voice to impact the project? GB: There are a couple of ways of thinking about it. One is getting people to the table, but there’s also bringing the table to people. I think we have an obligation to do both. The way that we do that is really by starting small and building relationships. We work to meet people where they are. We start with the relationships that we already have, which might be client-based or might be a broader set of relationships because we might have done some work in that city. We begin by doing one-on-one interviews, small conversations, and that might lead to bigger ones. We look for opportunities where communities are already having a conversation about something. If we can be flexible and meet people where they are to begin to develop dialogue and relationships, that can lead to other conversations. We find that there is a time and a place for large public meetings, but those are often not as effective as the aspiration. We find that it’s really before the meeting or after the meeting that is really important, when people feel a bit more comfortable talking in the smaller sessions. We try to build relationships across lots of sectors. We have people who live there, people who work there, community-based organizations, and institutions. We keep trying to navigate and build relationships that open other doors until we have a good sense of critical issues and patterns. We also try to make sure that we are not being extractive in that process and that we show reciprocity to people who are challenged with issues, particularly like being unhoused. It’s asking a lot for people to show up at a given place and time. So, we also work to pay people for their time, to create opportunities where it’s reciprocal in that way. Or if there’s something we can do that folks already need, we try to make sure that there’s an exchange happening. Because too often, we find that it’s easy to parachute into a place and ask everyone to put all their intellectual property on the table, and just offering pizza in return is not enough. MJ: The question of stewardship is something that we thought a lot about during the fellowship. What does it mean to be a steward of the public realm? You mentioned in our earlier conversation that designers who are working in the public realm have a higher responsibility to go sometimes beyond the interests of their client and keep in mind the public impact of their projects, and to weave those priorities into the project, as well as the client’s individual concerns. GB: Definitely. Designers get to make all kinds of choices about what issues to research and what makes a context, and to me, context is everything. The question of what ought to happen here—the answer isn’t always a building. The building is not a victory if it’s not the right thing. Part of the obligation there is to step back and look at the big picture of, whether it’s a building or a park, what that does to its context and how that building or that park or that space needs to respond to its context. That’s a critical lens for looking at public realm projects. You don’t get to operate in a vacuum and you shouldn’t. Private realm projects shouldn’t either, but I think with public realm projects we have a greater obligation to think about the constituencies, and to be mindful of it, and keep the needs and aspirations of the various people who might use this space front of mind the whole time. If we’re talking about people experiencing homelessness—and that’s a very complex problem—part of what we want to do is think about how the space can be designed so it’s welcoming and inviting. And what are the operational needs that we could fulfill and be thinking about ahead of time? If a park is the closest thing to a population of folks with a certain set of needs, and let’s say it’s a health need, maybe the park field house operates much like a health clinic would if there were one. It’s unpacking what the needs are, which move around, and people move around. Buildings and sites don’t, so we have to build in some flexibility, so we can continue to serve the needs of people who live in and around the site. MJ: Once the design is implemented, the project can take on a life of its own, and that life is highly impacted by how the space is maintained, how it’s managed, and how it’s activated. This is something that designers are not always involved in. How would you like designers to be involved in that? GB: In all this, there’s an element of engaging with the people who are experiencing the space and asking, “What is the best way? What would make this space feel welcoming?” I think designers have an obligation to do that. There’s sort of the nuts and bolts of maintenance and bringing in that expertise earlier rather than later in the design project that is important. But I think after something is built, designers need to be interested in going back to projects and saying, “Did it work? Did we achieve what we thought we would achieve?” Being willing to do occupancy analysis of the space, being willing to re-engage in conversations—that’s something that designers could certainly do. “With public realm projects we have a greater obligation to think about the constituencies, and to be mindful of it, and keep the needs and aspirations of the various people who might use this space front of mind the whole time.” In my experience, when I worked for the City of Chicago, I designed parks, got them built, and then also had to maintain them. Maybe there ought to be a residency program for designers at city agencies, where you actually have to experience the consequences of what you’ve built. It’s not just, drive by your project every couple of years and see if it stills looks good. Maybe there’s a way to incorporate the experience of maintenance into the educational background of architects. I’m excited to think about the multidimensional aspects of maintenance. When we worked on a project for the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice in New York, part of the proposition was that maintenance is about dignity. Whether a city maintains a neighborhood—and that’s sidewalks and streets and services and all of that—is a signal to that community of what the city thinks of it. Broken lights, broken benches, all of those things are signals of care. At the same time, it’s also a barometer for the health of your city. If our public spaces are welcoming and inviting, if our sidewalks are in good condition, if our roads and our streetlights in pretty good repair, then we are sending a big signal to the world that we’re doing well. The public realm and how we treat people in it is a marker of who we are as a city. That’s the front-of-mind question that designers should be thinking about if you’re going to touch the public realm. It is that important. It is the biggest thing you can do. It will outlive you. Your grandchildren will hopefully walk on those sidewalks. It should matter deeply and longitudinally. MJ: That’s a great point. GB: I think stewardship is a very big test, and that’s why I think the proposition about the public realm is a pretty exciting one. How do you get everyone to pull on the same rope and be under the same tent? And that means, how do you help folks who live in a place to feel like it belongs to them? That they’d invest their time, sweat equity and networks to get people engaged in the public realm? And then how do you get community-based organizations in that tent? BIDs in that tent? The maintenance itself is creating a relationship between the service providers, the city, the organizations and the people. It’s not just a one-way delivery of services. If a city only thinks about maintenance as, “Well, we go in, and there’s a work order, and it’s the work order that came up on my screen today, so that’s the one we’re doing,” that’s not good enough. The maintenance itself is creating a relationship between the service providers, the city, the organizations and the people. We need to think about maintenance as a set of relationships. There are lots of ways for places to be beautiful, and feel good, managed and welcoming all at the same time, but there’s no one entity that can deliver all of that. It does take a set of relationships, a constellation of care, in order to make that happen. MJ: We love the idea of stewardship because it has this moral component to it. It speaks to care and community and personal investment and institutional investment, not only with financial resources but with time and mental energy and social capital, in a way that the idea of maintenance doesn’t really. The idea of cities reclaiming their stewardship of the public realm and, as you’re saying, recognizing that it’s their front door—this is the place where people get a feel for the city itself—is a really important aspect of urban design in our minds. Okay, last question: what will it take for public spaces to be truly for all, for everyone? GB: That’s a really big question, and it is one of those adaptive challenges. It’s like the conversation about equity. In my mind, equity is a verb. It can’t be just an end that someday we can say, “Oh, we made it, we got equity.” No, it’s a constant process. Making public spaces for everyone is a constant work in progress because people change, populations move, needs are different, tools are lost and found. There are all kinds of ways we need to continually work on this issue. Since the beginning of time, we’ve had contested spaces. I think, though, we need to err on the side of being as welcoming possible. And welcoming means different things to different people. There’s a community center up in Toronto that has a significant immigrant population that was very uncomfortable with changing rooms. So, the Toronto Park District came up with a new kind of locker room that was a wildly sort of transparent and private place at the same time, that made it possible for people who had religious considerations with being in locker rooms and exposing themselves to other people to use the space. That design response is a construct of our changing communities all the time, and it’s a wonderful response. I think creating public spaces truly for all is an evolving question. But if we err on the side of being welcoming, being inviting, having care for other people, seeing ourselves in other people’s circumstances, coming into these questions with empathy, but then also taking action—all of those things will help us get there. It’s important to think about what public space for all means especially in communities that have been disenfranchised, that haven’t had investment, as we think about what it means to develop a public space in a community that no one paid attention to, but suddenly speculators are interested and so now the city’s going to invest and all those kinds of things. We also need to take care—back to that question of equity—that a community can also feel like a space belongs to them. It’s definitely an ongoing tension—you want to have local ownership, and you also want to be welcoming and inviting. I think we’re just going to keep sliding back and forth on that continuum, but again, if we err on the side of being good human beings, being good to one another, then we’ll probably get close to getting it right. Gia Biagi is the first permanent Chicago Department of Transportation commissioner under Mayor Lori Lightfoot starting in 2020. Previously, Biagi was a Principal at Studio Gang, an architecture and urban design collective located in Chicago and New York. Gia is widely regarded as a thought leader around issues related to cities and public space and guided the Studio’s Urbanism and Civic Impact work. At Studio Gang, she led design teams, coordinated master plans, facilitated community engagement, and directed the urban approach for projects across the United States. Prior to joining Studio Gang, Gia spent sixteen years working for the City of Chicago, including posts at the Park District as Director of Planning, Director of Strategy and Policy, and Chief of Staff. She led multi-year planning, design, and community engagement efforts that produced signature civic projects. Header image credit: joestoltz via Pixabay"
34,Shelter for All: An Interview with Chris Burbank,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-chris-burbank/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Chris Burbank, Vice President of Law Enforcement Strategy for Center for Policing Equity, accompanies Homelessness in the Public Realm. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Madison Loew: Can you tell us about your experiences addressing homelessness during your time as police chief in Salt Lake City? Chris Burbank: Salt Lake City has always had a fairly significant population of individuals suffering from homelessness. As in most cities, when the area started to gentrify, we started to see more conflict. Early in my career, the homeless shelter was built in no man’s land. It was near the railroad tracks and some very seedy bars. Nobody paid any attention. But then as the city started to grow and the need for urban housing amplified, we started to see tremendous conflict. What we tried to do at the police department was to address the underlying cause. Right away, we identified our 20 most frequent flyers. These were people that actually spent the most time with officers in the police department. And they were all homeless. Most of them had drug, alcohol, or mental health issues, or a combination thereof, and had extensive arrest histories. Some of them, over 500 arrests—and that’s not an exaggeration—in their lifetime. 500 arrests. If we arrest somebody 510 times, are we going to change the outcome? So, we started to look at, what is the underlying cause of what’s going on? Those individuals were costing the city and police service alone about $1 million a year. We developed a very forward-thinking initiative for housing first. We gave all these individuals transitional homes. Some of their housing was contingent upon them attending counseling or taking medication, but it was never, “Alright, you have to stop drinking, or you can’t have this house.” We adopted a model in which police officers would not just arrest people for quality of life issues: trespassing, urinating in public, intoxication in public, and some of those other things that just are vicious cycles that never solve anyone’s underlying issues. We started to say, “Well, okay, here’s how you go about getting a job.” In fact, at one point, there were several of my officers, on their own time, who were driving eight individuals to a job that the captain of the division had arranged for them in a garden shop. Not only did we stop making some arrests, but I also told my officers, “You can’t write jaywalking tickets anymore.” Because what we found was that we were only writing them to homeless people. We were only writing them around the shelter. And as far as race, they were very biased in who they were being written to. I just said, “No, we’re not going to write those anymore. Anywhere in the city.” And the fact was that we weren’t writing them anywhere else in the city. That developed an avenue to have dialogue with people, as opposed to just, “I’m going to get you off the street, and out of sight, out of mind.” We, in society, feel threatened, endangered, uncomfortable in the presence of some individuals, and the police have been the tool to move them along. We started to see that we could actually change the circumstance, as opposed to just shuffling people through the criminal justice system, which obviously was not having a good outcome. Sign in Salt Lake City. ML: Could you tie some of those experiences to the work that you’re doing now at the Center for Policing Equity? CB: At the Center for Policing Equity, we focus on the intersection between the public and the police, and more specifically, between race and policing. We try to determine what are the underlying causes of the disparate outcomes of the criminal justice system. We ask, “What is the underlying cause of this? And what is the contribution of policing to that outcome?” Because when you talk to law enforcement, they always say, “Well, we just go where the crime is.” By that notion, you would then say, because of the outcomes of the system, that Black people in America commit more crime than people of other races, which is not true. There have been countless studies that have demonstrated that race is not an indicator of criminal activity or criminal behavior. When you start to talk about homelessness and these other things, they’re very similar. The homeless man on this street corner asking for money is not a lot different than the Black man walking down an alley in any given city. And now you make that homeless person a Black male, 25 years old, who’s large in stature, boy—the perceived threat he poses to society is significantly higher. There are fascinating studies that talk about our perception of Black men, or men of color, being older, stronger, bigger, larger, more intimidating, and that plays into policing. We need to recognize, this, to say, “Yeah, that’s driving not only who’s calling us but how we deal with people when we show up.” What are we going to do to change it? And then, most importantly, how are we going to measure that to make sure that whatever we are doing is actually working and changing the outcome? We do a very poor job of measuring when it comes to law enforcement. We train officers, we make rules, laws, but we don’t actually look and say, does it change behavior? ML: And when it comes to changing behavior, I know that was a big part of the training materials that you work on at the Center for Policing Equity. Could you talk about those training materials and the scale at which you have brought them to so many different places? CB: The idea is to have people recognize that within themselves and also within the systems in which they work—and hence, quite frankly, the society in which we live—bias is interjected constantly. And it exists in a lot of different forms. It is gender bias, it is race bias, it is bias against individuals suffering from poverty. We all have these preconceived notions that we have in life. It’s very hard to recognize and understand the biases that we have towards most issues of race, and homelessness, and poverty, which are deeply ingrained in us. If you have had a life experience that has made you believe a certain thing about race, about gender, about someone poor, it is very hard for me to change that core belief that you have within. But what I can change is how that’s projected in your behavior. Let’s start to look at what we can measure very easily: it is behavior. Measuring your feelings are more difficult. Talk about your feelings, measure behavior. Combine the two, and then you can change the outcome. That’s what the training is there for, to recognize what we have within ourselves, to recognize what’s being imposed because of someone else, or society, or the system in which I work. And then, to recognize the things that I can do to change the outcome. Some of those can be very difficult situations, especially when you talk about a homeless individual, whether it’s private security or police. Private security usually represents a property owner of some type. And someone is on their property or on the fringe of their property, and they are often asking for money. They are viewed as a disturbance or a hindrance to someone coming in, to what they would view as their customers. The call is either to private security or to the police. We often fall into that mode of, ”How can I deal with you right now?” And that is often, “Do you have a warrant? Are you doing something inappropriate? Or can I send you on your way? Do I have enough authority to say you can’t be here, be down the street?” One, that just creates someone else’s problem. And two, when we do just take somebody to jail, it doesn’t break this cycle of them coming back or going somewhere else in society. Now it may not be my problem anymore, but it’s someone else’s problem. We start to learn and understand and educate people: What is the end? Why is this person homeless? What are their needs? Is it a job? And then, what are the factors that go into getting a job? It becomes really easy to say, “Oh, yeah, go get a job.” But when you show up with only the clothes on your back to get a job, sometimes it’s very difficult. What do you do with your backpack, your shopping cart, your box, or whatever it is, that you are carrying your possessions around in every single day, that most cities in their homeless shelters don’t provide long-term storage for? Now I have to bring that with me and go. Well, if I’m bringing all that to somebody and saying, “Hey, here I am, give me a job,” that’s very difficult. If you have small mental health issues that are controlled with medication or a little bit of therapy, and you don’t have access to that, how are you going to get the job if that manifests itself in the middle of your job or job interview? What is that underlying cause? You can change people long term. It is not the mass change, it is not the fast change, but it becomes the more permanent change. ML: That gets us to our next question, which is, what does a more compassionate public realm management specifically look like? I would love to hear about metrics, because you brought up metrics a couple of times. If you’re held to certain metrics, then you’re going to be held to certain outcomes. CB: I believe public spaces should be available to the public. I may be radical in that, in particular circumstances. And when I say the public, that’s everybody, to share and to participate in. Sometimes that is hard because of how we design public spaces. Over time, there’s been lots of, “Well, you don’t put seating down because if you put seating down, then the homeless people are going to sit.” Well, if you don’t put seating down, then I’m not going to sit there. I don’t want to be facetious by any means, but they want me to sit there. They want the responsible middle-aged white guy to sit there and participate, because that is the notion that we have in society of safe, good communities. I mean, it’s not right, but that’s exactly what it is. The idea should be that is it accessible to everyone to participate. The way you do away with disorder that is inappropriate, you’ve seen it done most successfully with programming. When spaces are alive and vibrant and participating, then you don’t have those negative things. And this is where you really have to draw the line. Looking, acting, behaving differently than someone else is not disorder. I am talking about theft, I am talking about assault; not looking, not asking for money. If there are avenues to have a discussion if somebody is not meeting the expectation of the space—avenues to have discussions about why not or how can they, are much more important. I’m not talking about just allowing anything to take place. But when those individuals are causing that disturbance, the question is not, “Get out of here, go to jail tonight.” The question is, “How can I help you tonight? How can I change your circumstance so that you can be here and not be the problem?” And we can do that. The majority of people, when you ask the question, “What can I do for you tonight? What is it that you need?”—you start to differentiate, and then you actually start to solve the problem. We have tremendous resources available to us in this country that are not available to everybody. ML: Can you say more about the resources? CB: When I think about health systems, job placement, clothing, and meals that are available in Salt Lake—because I’m obviously more familiar with that—there’s quite a bit of opportunity. Nowhere near enough; I’m not saying we’re oversaturated. But very rarely are those people that are encountered by law enforcement or private security given the means to obtain those services, because the criminal justice system prevents that. People don’t understand. I mean, I know nothing about your circumstances in life, but I’m willing to bet that if you get a speeding ticket tomorrow, it’s going to be expensive and it’s going to hurt and you’re going to be upset that you got it. But you pay that speeding ticket and go on with life. If you are deciding whether or not to pay the ticket, or get food, or drive the car, there is tremendous disparity. It does not equal justice, based on your socio-economic status. And then that becomes overwhelming. That speeding ticket, when it becomes a bench warrant, becomes an arrest warrant, becomes an arrest on your record that when you go for housing now you tell people you’ve been arrested before. That’s a significant challenge in this day and age of computers, because people check on that. ML: This brings us back to the metrics. What are the behaviors that you feel are incentives given the current metrics set up for law enforcement today, like writing tickets or arrests? CB: We as the public are responsible for that. It is our expectation of policing that we arrest, that we write tickets, that we are proactive in the work that we do. We don’t like it and we hold the police accountable when crime goes up. We oftentimes say, inappropriately, that when crime goes down it’s because we did such great police work and we did extra enforcement. But when you really look historically at some of the things that we use to measure success, the arrests don’t correlate to decreased crime, the number of police officers doesn’t correlate to safety. For example, a few years ago when the economy turned downward, in one year over the next 40,000 fewer police officers were working than the year before. Crime, and especially violent crime, declined dramatically during that time. In the mid-90s, we arrested more people and incarcerated more people than we ever have in the history of the world, and violent crime was at an all-time high. Now we think that if we arrest more people and crime goes down, we take credit for it. We’re measuring the wrong metrics. “…when you really look historically at some of the things that we use to measure success, the arrests don’t correlate to decreased crime, the number of police officers doesn’t correlate to safety.” The other thing that I find is a very faulty metric—when a police agency puts up arrests, how many of those are repeat offenders? How many of those are multiple arrests of the same individual in the same year that you’re counting? Did you solve the problem by having to arrest them twice? And were you twice as good because you arrested the guy twice? Let’s say the metric is much better if you show how many people you don’t have to arrest. How many people didn’t go to jail? How many people received diversion out of the system and didn’t have to participate in it? And then consequently, how many of those people didn’t come back? ML: Throughout this conversation, you have made several great comments addressing the last question I had, which is, what will it take for public spaces to be truly for all? CB: We often point fingers inappropriately at law enforcement and at security. “It’s their fault, they’re less sympathetic.” What we need to change is our expectation as a society and our expectation of safety and wellbeing. Until we change what public expectation is, we are still going to have a machine that shows up and takes people away in order to make other people feel safe. Again, there are people who need to be out of society. But it’s a small, small percentage. When we look at the majority of people that we incarcerate in this country, they are there for misdemeanor things. That’s not right. When you start to look in any city, at the number of people who are incarcerated daily for quality of life things that we can change, what we all in society need to say is, “Let’s change what the expectation is of policing.” Then our spaces will truly be public and accessible to all people. Because we don’t have that need to divide society. Chief Burbank serves as Vice President of Law Enforcement Strategy for Center for Policing Equity.

35,Shelter for All: An Interview with Jonathan Marvel,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-jonathan-marvel/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Jonathan Marvel, Founding Principal of Marvel Architects, accompanies Breaking Free: Preventing the Prison-to-Shelter Pipeline. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Ishita Gaur: How did Marvel Architects get involved in New York City’s homelessness landscape? Jonathan Marvel: Homelessness has been on our radar, as architects with a social conscience, for quite a while. It’s tragic to see so many human beings without a home. The opportunity to participate in a solution to this tragedy came up recently, but it had been occupying our thinking for a while. We have done so much work in New York City’s public realm over the years, improving the quality of life for the pedestrian and the user of urban public domain (the space between buildings): our parks and streets and underpasses. The homeless population has also been using these places in a variety of ways, both as shelter and as social gathering places. Our initial involvement came through the backdoor, in terms of designing public spaces that are people-friendly, that offer comfortable places to sit and social places to gather. Public space is so often unwelcome to the homeless population because of the unfortunate biases that exist against them. There was so much negative energy towards the homeless issue during the years leading up to today. Under Mayor David Dinkins—I’m going that far back because I think that it is important to reach back into history—there was a burgeoning explosion of homeless issues having to do with the unfortunate timing of New York State releasing so many people from state-sponsored rehab institutions. At that time, the churches provided a lot of support for the homeless because the City wasn’t ready to do so. Now that the City is mandated to provide shelter, I think our sensitivity towards the homeless has shifted from volunteerism to seeing a role for our professional skills. Now the issue is providing shelters and public spaces that are friendly and that are effective for both the homeless and the neighborhoods in which those shelters are located. We need to coexist. In our work with the Human Resources Administration, when we were doing the master plan for the Bellevue Men’s Shelter— as you know, because you were leading the effort—we were able to channel that energy directly into a project. We engaged so many wonderful people who have deep backgrounds directly serving homeless people, whom we brought onto our team to masterplan the 800-bed men’s shelter and other facilities offered at Bellevue. IG: You mentioned churches stepping up. It sounds like there was a push for existing institutions to do their part, and one of the reasons why churches were successful was because they were already welcoming spaces. For my team’s project, we said that libraries can also be a neighborhood asset to leverage. How important do you think it is for a city like New York with limited space and high density to be leveraging existing assets? Are there other spaces that you can think that could work for homeless people? JM: I think that is the key issue: Where to locate shelters and the size of the shelters. I think anybody with the capacity and interest has to be involved. Churches are obvious places because they’re already lending a helping hand and offering caring support services. About 15 years ago, we did a study of five armories in the context of a critical emergency envelope effort. These armories were already hosting men’s and women’s shelters as well, and the shelters in the armories were really afterthoughts. People going to the shelter often had to go through a backdoor, creating an unfriendly relationship with the neighborhood. Armories are, like many other civic structures, carryovers from a bygone era and need to be repurposed, but in a more intentional way. So, leveraging existing assets starts with churches, because they do outreach anyway, and armories, because the City owned them so they were the low hanging fruit. I think that there are so many additional places to try smaller scale integration of the homeless population. We are trying to encourage the City to develop a shelter system that they could build quickly and for very low cost, as well as figure out how to improve the existing shelter stock. So many existing shelters are improvised existing structuring and ad-hoc. But retrofitting or renovating these sites could cause a disruption in services to the shelter residents. We are exploring how to provide continued service in those neighborhoods so the residents can get the care they need and the space they live in can be more dignified. Maybe it is moving the population temporarily in an alternative location adjacent to the existing shelter while we redesign the existing space more purposefully and efficiently before moving the residents back. I think using a pop-up shelter system as a bridge allows for long term improvements to existing shelters should be explored further, this allows us to repurpose the many underutilized properties in neighborhoods that have shelters. Perhaps we should also explore other kinds of services that could double up as shelters. I know that it’s been a real problem to use hotels as shelter because it’s expensive and often easily abused by hotel owner-operators gaming the system, exploiting the City knowing they will pay lots of money for temporary housing because of the legal mandate. However, I think that it’s not a bad solution to use the hotel system that offers a flexible dormitory type of situation, but maybe we could study those and develop a public-private partnership with those operators to make them affordable.

IG: You touched on two or three ways that design creates dignified environments or undignified environments, for example, backdoor entries. How can the design of spaces contribute to the feeling of being in a dignified space? JM: There are some universal issues that you’re touching on, whether it’s a house or an apartment building or a homeless shelter or a school or a library; public places should feel welcoming and dignified. Shelters are never going to be permanent residences for individuals, and because of that, they must have some universal appeal, whether it’s across age, gender or family versus individual space. A fundamental universal design goal is daylight and natural light. Spaces with limited or no daylight are the most inhuman spaces. We are creatures of light. We’re not like cats, although many of us have developed a nocturnal lifestyle. We are diurnal. I think daylighting spaces is the fundamental principle for good design, whether it’s for a room or a gathering place or a hallway or an outdoor space. Sunlight is our number one design goal when it comes to offering dignified space, acknowledging the basic needs of the human condition, which is to get out of the weather. A roof over your head is a fundamental human right, and once you have that roof, daylighting that space is our fundamental design goal. Another design goal would be a sense of comfort when it comes to scale. So often we see that people will congregate towards a nook or a smaller defensible space. Whether it’s a large room of people or a small area, people will tend to gravitate to where our back is against the wall. I think there’s something important in designing spaces for different amounts of people so that there are always places for people to find a place of respite that’s not too exposed. These large rooms are unsuccessful unless they are sprinkled with nooks and crannies, and then they can become more palatable for young people, elderly people, and families. IG: What do you think is the ideal solution to solve the problem of homelessness in New York City? And how can we as designers contribute to that vision? JM: There’s never going to be one solution. I think the solution that we could all probably agree on is lots of options for the homeless community. And those options need to range from small to large scale because of the quantities that need to be met. In terms of new purpose-built and designed shelters, several neighborhoods will put up resistance. That’s really a product of the fear factor: fear of the unknown, fear of something different, fear of the “other.” My experience is that the fear is worse than the thing itself. I think that the City needs to embrace a very benevolent and altruistic attitude, rather than a defensive one. …the City needs to embrace a very benevolent and altruistic attitude, rather than a defensive one. Maybe there’s a way to address that in a community participatory way, to be more open and accepting, and perhaps to see if a smaller site for a new shelter might be more agreeable with the residents. They could pilot programs so that those neighborhoods might be able to see that the shelter and its residents are more benign than one might think. Instead of making 90 units right away, maybe it can be phased so there could be 10 units for the first year, so people in the neighborhood can see what it’s like to have a shelter down the block. So, lots of scales and pilot projects to help take away the fear factor, the resistance, and humanize the residents in the process. Finally, the design for a population this fragile needs to be attentive to making things simple, easily accessible, and visually open. Reduce the confusion and sources for additional trauma. Because the better a person feels, the faster they can feel good about themselves, the faster they’ll be back to having a more normalized life. I think we must have that hope because nothing gets done without hope. And in light of so much negativity towards people who are homeless, we have to double down on creating more hope to help get them back into the lives that we have such a privilege to lead.

36,Shelter for All: An Interview with Rita Zimmer,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-rita-zimmer/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Rita Zimmer, Executive Director of HousingPlus, accompanies Breaking Free: Preventing the Prison-to-Shelter Pipeline. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Heli Pinillos: When HousingPlus was founded 17 years ago, it opened its doors to six families and six single women who had been incarcerated and homeless. Today HousingPlus houses more than 250 women and families, with a uniquely holistic approach helps women facing homelessness build lives of their own. Rita, how did you decide to start HousingPlus? What drove you? Rita Zimmer: I saw a need. I started with the person whose needs are not being met, in this case, a woman, or a woman and her children. I talked to people and understood better their needs. I was doing some volunteering work at state prisons in Westchester County. If you talk to the women and ask them what they needed, most will say housing, jobs, better services, and help reconnecting with their families and children. I had already done quite a bit of housing work. I started another organization called ‘Women in Need’ back in the eighties, so I had some experience with how to do housing throughout almost 20 years. We did new construction and we did shelters, so you learn how to put the package together. But if you provide housing and you don’t provide the support services to help them, they’re going to end up back in that pipeline that leads them back to prison or jail. If you look at the population who are in jail and the population who are homeless you find a lot of similarities. They are poor, lack good healthcare, lack a good education, and they end up taking a different path from others that leads to alcohol, drugs, and depression. You can’t just do housing; I mean housing is the foundation but you also need to provide support. And if you ask the question of why? I never thought so much about it, I just did it. HP: From Women in Need to volunteering at a correctional facility and now HousingPlus, did reentry services always exist? RZ: There have always been reentry services because there have always been people leaving prisons. They didn’t call it reentry; they called it coming home or something similar. Either on parole or after completing their full sentence, they have always been “coming home.” The Osborne Association and Fortune Society are among the oldest organizations doing reentry work. The Osborne Association is named after Thomas Mott Osborne, who was probably one of the first wardens in New York State in the early 1910s. He accepted the job on the condition that he would be allowed to live in prison undercover in order to learn what the inmates’ needs were. Most individuals had alcohol problems; some were mentally ill; others depressed or poor. He realized that if people didn’t get support once they were out of prison, they could end up going back in again. Through his family, this eventually led to the creation of the Osborne Association. They started all these outreach programs and now they are a big organization helping thousands of men. Similar story with a man named David Rothenberg in the late 60s. He was a producer on Broadway, who through research at Rikers for one of his plays ended up meeting some people and decided to found the Fortune Society. They now provide housing and services to many formerly incarcerated individuals. HP: Both the City and State offer reentry services, yet 5,000 people released on parole from state prisons went straight into a City shelter last year. Are the City and State efforts not coordinated? RZ: Parole is not in the housing business but there is public policy. If you don’t change the rules of who can get into housing, and the only way for formerly incarcerated individuals is to go through the shelter system, then there is a problem. Rita Zimmer with Forefront Fellows at Linwood Park Apartments, an affordable housing development in East New York, while under construction. There is a pilot program through HPD that offers Section 8 vouchers from HUD to people in reentry. They don’t have to be in the shelter system. That’s a breakthrough because you have to be chronically homeless to get this voucher. Usually, you are not considered homeless if you come from jail or prison. Now these vouchers can go to people who are coming out of jail or prison, people who need treatment. This is the type of program you need because once you come home without going through the shelter, and instead go through a transitional program with access to housing, you break that pipeline. The logistical part is difficult. Prisons don’t have the staff for this and parole would rather send people to the shelter system than send them to one of our programs. Parole has so much control. They have a lot of rules and monitoring, a type of control that doesn’t really help individuals get a job but instead punishes someone if they break the rules and sends them back to Rikers. Parole have a lot of power. HP: What are the challenges for women? Are the needs different for women than men? RZ: They can require different types of housing if they are with their kids. They would need an apartment as opposed to a room or studio. Especially as parents, they should receive mental-health services to overcome the trauma of having been incarcerated. Not to say that men are not traumatized, but women need a lot of support, especially when it comes to reuniting with their children. In this particular building, we have six women who came out of prison and all have been reunited with their kids. Four out the six are still with us today. Sometimes when these women go to work, the children will be afraid if the mother returns home late. It takes a long time to build that trust back and to guarantee something is not going to happen again. The children may still be angry. Or the children may have already become self-sufficient or accustomed to living with other family, and now that the mother is back, she can’t afford to buy the same things that the other family members could. The mothers feel shame, remorse, fearful, and the stigma of having been in prison. These are significant things. Society has a higher expectation for women. People don’t understand that if someone has an addiction or mental health problem, it is not always the person choosing. Also, women commit different types of crimes than men. They are less likely to do violent crimes. Sometimes women need diapers or clothes and they end up stealing to take care of their kids. HP: Talking about kids and that period when their parents are away in prison, do the children and other family members get access to reentry services? RZ: The Osborne Association does a lot of reentry for families. They have a whole unit and do a lot of video visiting. The family goes to a studio, which is set up like a living room, and the parent goes to a special room at the correctional facility. They can spend approximately 30 minutes catching up over video conference. For on-site meetings, there is a bi-weekly visiting program that takes the family to the prison. There is also a trailer that women can use to spend the weekend with their family, but you need to earn that privilege. The truth is that a lot of mothers don’t want their kids to come to prison. Having to go through security is so painful for everybody. People who have long sentences need to break through that and accept it, but others who have short sentences would rather tell their kids they are going away for school or the military. Linwood Park Apartments under construction. HP: We would like to propose scaling up the use of technology, making virtual meetings accessible to inmates as a way to reconnect parents with their family. Do you see that as helpful? RZ: It always helps. Some families do want those services, and maybe it does help maintain a good relationship with the person in jail or prison. An interesting fact is that men get more visitors than women do, so reentry for women can be more difficult because people don’t visit them. If you go to Rikers Island and get on the bus on a Friday or Saturday, there will be mostly women visiting their boyfriends, husbands, brothers, or fathers. There are few men on that bus visiting another woman. That tells you how women are viewed by others including their family. The reconnecting can be very important for both sides because there are programs where caseworkers work very hard to encourage their clients to reconnect but there can be resistance from the family. There are many cases where the parents haven’t been together for a long time and they need to work on rebuilding that relationship. It is hard because there is mistrust and resentment. These family dynamics are very hard, even in the best families. HP: To end, what does it mean to end homelessness? RZ: You need housing, housing that is safe and affordable. That’s what they need and Linwood Park Apartments it’s a good example of that. Rita Zimmer has a long history of working to create opportunities for women in New York City. She is Executive Director of HousingPlus and Executive Director of the Women’s Community Justice Project. She founded Women in Need in 1983, volunteered at Taconic and Beacon Correctional Facilities, and helped create the nonprofit Women’s Community Justice Association. She holds a Master’s in Public Health from New York University. Rita wants to reimagine justice, dignity, and safety for women. Header image credit: Forefront Fellows"
37,Shelter for All: An Interview with Judy Whiting,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-judy-whiting/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Judy Whiting, General Counsel for the Community Service Society (CSS), accompanies Breaking Free: Preventing the Prison-to-Shelter Pipeline. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Melissa Minnich: What are some of the big problems that your clients face as they leave prison and reenter civil society? Judy Whiting: The insurmountable barrier is for people with sex offenses. They cannot get housing, period. Sometimes they remain incarcerated because suitable housing cannot be found for them; they are staying well beyond their release dates. Instead, they are put in residential treatment facilities, which are just the same prison with a different sign on the door. The biggest reasons for this bottleneck are the residency restrictions that prevent people who are a Level 3 registrant or whose conviction involved children from living within 1,000 feet of a school. When you map that out across the city, it means that just about every area is inaccessible for this group of people. MM: What happens then? JW: What used to happen, until a few years ago, is that many people on release from prison were sent by parole to the Bellevue Men’s Shelter on 1st Avenue and East 30th Street. The staff at Bellevue would then work with people and try to find them housing that was compliant with the law. But at a certain point, a legislator made it known very publicly that Bellevue was within 1,000 feet of a school. So immediately, the process at Bellevue was shut down. It had been the source for years for people who were trying to transition to something more permanent than a shelter. What that meant was there were far fewer places where they could be sent after leaving prison to find housing. MM: Was that because of a change, like a school had been built? JW: No, it was just that people had looked the other way because this was the only viable solution at the time. The change didn’t come about because there’d been any kind of incident. It was just that this legislator came out swinging, saying that we’re putting children in danger by having these “predators” at the shelter, when in fact, that was probably the safest place for them to be. MM: What does New York City’s right to shelter mean for those with a history of sex offense convictions? JW: It’s a really difficult problem. I don’t know that the right to shelter applies to somebody who is still incarcerated. Once they’re here in the city, there’s a right to shelter. But while they’re still in an upstate prison, they don’t have that right yet. So, there’s the bottleneck of people who can’t even make it to the city to invoke their right to shelter. The New York City Department of Homeless Services is having a terrible time freeing up spaces for people so that little by little people can be released from what constitutes prison. Some advocates have proposed that there be special shelters for individuals who are on the registry, just so we can find a place to get them out of prison. On some level, that’s a good idea. But on another level, I worry about vigilantism. I know of someone who was released from prison, who came home to a shelter, only to find that shelter was noncompliant. He’d lived with his family in their home, and they wanted him back, but they were not allowed to have him back because the house was too close to a school. So, he got sent from shelter to shelter only to end up in a shelter way up somewhere in the Bronx, where people discovered that he was a registrant and somebody set him on fire. Right now, I think the only shelter that is housing people with the residency restriction—and it’s questionable whether it’s even compliant— is Wards Island. There are some shelters way out on the borders of Rockaway and the deepest reaches of Brooklyn that are also housing people. It’s a huge problem. I think as long as we have that residency restriction, which hasn’t been shown to improve public safety, we’re in trouble. “…as long as we have that residency restriction, which hasn’t been shown to improve public safety, we’re in trouble.” MM: What’s different about the reentry system today from when you first started working in this area? JW: There wasn’t any recognition that collateral consequences were that important or being felt. Certainly, individuals who were facing collateral consequences were feeling them, but the sheer awfulness of all the things that were piling on people hadn’t gotten the public recognition that it got several years later. I credit people with the lived experience of incarceration and the civil consequences of conviction for bringing these issues to the fore and rallying around the need to get things done. With their rallying and the support of Legal Services and other advocates, I think things changed. It’s still changing. It’s still getting to be part of a more normalized conversation. And I think that’s good. It’s only moving upwards in terms of being on the radar of the normal citizen, which is good. MM: How do you see the needs of people entering the shelter system from prison as being different from others’ needs? JW: I imagine that if you polled the street homeless, you would find that many of them are people with conviction histories who encountered insurmountable barriers and ended up homeless as a result. I think prison causes terrible trauma. Prison can cause, maybe intentionally, serious mental issues for people. For people transitioning, particularly from a long period of incarceration, back into life in the city, it can be very daunting, to say the least. I think there’s a lot of adjustment and a lot of unmet needs. MM: In October 2018, you published a policy brief entitled “Getting to Go: The case for criminal record expungement in New York State.” In that, you write that no matter how many positive strides a person has made, under our current law, a criminal record is on their record for the rest of their lives, which often acts as a barrier for housing and jobs. You make the case that this needs to change. Can you talk about this and what effect expungement could have on homelessness in New York City? JW: Well, I think expungement could have a very positive effect. If we were able to make it so that a record did not exist anymore or was tightly sealed from public view, then landlords—private landlords in particular—would not be able to run background checks that would turn up these past convictions. We find that people who are applying for housing in the private market are uniformly turned away if a background check is done and they have a conviction history, no matter how old it was. What would be shielded from view from public housing would depend on exactly what law got passed. We would argue that past convictions should also be kept from the view of housing authorities and public housing agencies that are issuing Section 8 vouchers and other forms of housing assistance. MM: So that would open up NYCHA housing. JW: It would open up NYCHA. The only caveat to that is there are federal laws that prohibit housing providers in most programs from providing any federal housing assistance to people who have lifetime sex offender registration requirements or were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine on public housing grounds. Among other things, expungement would make it possible for people to earn a living. You would be able to get a job as opposed to being turned away, kicked to the curb, or completely ignored when you try to find employment. If people had actual income, accessing private housing would be much easier. MM: What do you see happening with that policy brief? JW: We think that there is a positive movement towards expungement, particularly now that there’s an effort to legalize marijuana. We’re not certain exactly how that’s going to shake out. But both the legislature and the governor are very interested in having it happen and have proposed bills that would do that. Negotiations going on right now about what form that should take in the end, but we think it is going to happen. As part of that, we are pushing to make sure that past criminal convictions for any behavior that becomes legalized are automatically expunged. If that comes to pass, then that is the first foray into the world of automatic expungement of past criminal convictions. There’s already a law that allows people in limited circumstances to apply to seal convictions. That’s a law that was passed in 2017 as part of the Raise the Age legislation. It allows people who have no more than two convictions in their lifetime to apply to have them sealed. And there are lots of restrictions, but this law exists. There’s also understanding that it’s helpful, but not helpful enough, and needs to be amended. There’s a lot of movement afoot to broaden its scope and make it available to more people. We think that it is also another way forward towards more universal expungement. We’ve had interest from legislators about legislation that would automatically expunge other types of convictions, so we’re working on that. I don’t think that’s going anywhere this year. But it’s good that they’re thinking about it, and we’re thinking about it, and that we’re going to work together to try to move it forward. MM: I told you that our team wants to develop a way to provide those with a history of incarceration with resources upon release, so that they have something in hand besides just a one-way cab ride that’s going drop them off somewhere in northern Manhattan on the streets, which tends to be what happens in New York State and New York City. That’s not a good way to enter the city, and oftentimes that’s how people end up on the streets and in shelters and or back prisons because in New York City being homeless is effectively a crime. JW: It sounds like a fantastic idea. From what little I hear about what resources and programs are already available right now, I do think that there isn’t enough emphasis on housing. I think people are desperate for housing. And any information people could get about housing would be extremely important. That said, if someone is going to be released on parole or post-release supervision, the parole officer must have some say in where they’re going. So, not all options might be available to somebody. But still, trying to work on that as early as possible before people leave so that they don’t spend an inordinate amount of time in the shelter system would be an amazing thing. “Trying to work on [finding housing] as early as possible before people leave so that they don’t spend an inordinate amount of time in the shelter system would be an amazing thing.” Off topic: another thing that I’ve been thinking about for a long time, and I know it’s not this simple, but why do we provide vocational training in prisons where the training is not recognized on the outside? People spend lots and lots of time getting certified to do various things, only to find out when they get out of prison that these certifications are practically useless: they have to take more programs and get more education to get qualifications that are recognized. Why can’t we make sure that training in prison is recognized? And the second thing is, why can’t we have vocational training programs that lead to granting people a conditional license when they leave prison? If you’re trained as a barber, for example, why can’t you walk out of prison with a license? It makes things so difficult. Somebody should be able to immediately practice the trade that they’ve been trained in. MM: What do you think it would take to end homelessness in New York City? Do you think it’s even possible? JW: Changing rent regulation, so that we could somehow rewind the tape and get back to the sorts of protections that we had in the 70s, 80s, and maybe even early 90s. Before vacancy decontrol; before major capital improvement increases could be permanently added to people’s rent even after the capital project had been completed; before the big increases that people were facing for luxury decontrol, which took many apartments out of regulation. If there were a way to reinstate regulation on some level, that would be extremely helpful. So much damage has been done that reinstating rent regulation now will freeze rents at rates that are unaffordable to many low-income people. However, it’s a proactive step that needs to be done before the damage is complete. Deregulation has transformed entire neighborhoods in a matter of a decade, and the damage is real. But it can be stopped if we changed rent regulation, and reinstated in a really powerful way. I’m not an expert in inclusionary zoning, but that needs to be so much more robust. I read that Hudson Yards is going to build 4,000 new units of residential housing, which I think are rental, and of that, 10% are going to go to—I don’t even know, it didn’t say whether it would be low-income, it might be moderate-income people. Any protection like that is very important, and I’m glad that that’s happening. But we’ve done so little in terms of new construction to require that there be a set aside for people who can’t afford to live in these buildings otherwise.

38,Shelter for All: An Interview with Graham Ciraulo,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-graham-ciraulo/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Graham Ciraulo, a tenant leader with the Metropolitan Council on Housing, accompanies Systemic Radical Change. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. Nova Lucero: Can you tell us how you got involved in organizing with the Met Council on Housing? Graham Ciraulo: I moved to Inwood basically out of emergency. I had lost my job and we were priced out of our apartment at the same time. I was able to find something in Inwood that happened to be rent-stabilized, just by chance. I was at a church, the Good Shepherd in Inwood, and the priest said at the end of the mass, “The neighborhood is being rezoned, and there is a meeting about it. You should all go.” This is in 2015. And when I hear rezoning, I know exactly what they’re going to do. I went, and that’s when I first really got a taste of the EDC and how they treat people in the community. Inwood is still largely a Latino community, a lot of the longtime residents, and those are the people who show up to these meetings. The EDC people were just so disrespectful. They had never been up to Inwood before. They were just kind of wonky urban planners, and they were talking down to everybody. They were like, “Well, what do you want? What do you all want? What do you want?” And people would say, “Well, we like the low-rise buildings.” “Yeah, but don’t you like this? What about this esplanade?” And they showed these shiny projects, like, “Don’t you want this?” People would try to talk about the real problems in the community. And the EDC representative would just be like, “Okay, okay.” I was distressed by it. At the end, someone said, “We like our neighborhood the way it is.” And the EDC representative said, “Well, I know it’s really nice, but you know, it can’t stay like this forever,” or something like that. I was just enraged. Residents fight for affordable housing in Inwood. Image credit: Nova Lucero. Somebody handed me a flyer from the Met Council on Housing about an emergency meeting, that says, “Fight back.” And I said, “I’m going to this!” That’s when I went to my first Met Council meeting. Everybody there helped me get involved in organizing, and I just learned so much. Emma Silverblatt: I wanted to ask you about something that the EDC person said to you, that it can’t stay that way forever. What is your response to that working in housing? Can it stay “a way” forever? GC: No, but that’s what’s so condescending about it. Everybody knows it can’t stay “a way” forever. But the paternalism, in that case, was off the charts. Everybody knows things don’t stay the same, especially if you live in New York. But the idea that somebody would say to an elderly woman who loves her neighborhood, who’s been on the front lines, who goes to all these meetings, and talk down to them like that—what I learned about the EDC is that they are just horrible at community relations. They learned a little. You could tell they were learning more over time. Over a few years, they tried to make a noticeable effort to change their methods. They stopped talking about esplanades, and stuff like that. There was a change. But it took a long time. NL: Yeah, three years. GC: And it took us beating a few projects. We kind of beat them into it. Now they’re gone; we’re rezoned. But they started to focus more on affordable housing, at least talking about it. They started to focus a little bit more on claiming to listen, which was more of a deflection tactic. Instead of trying to force us to agree with them, which was their original approach, it became more, “We’re hearing you; we’re going to make the changes.” Changes would never come. It became a much more defensive project, and that’s when you realize that they were never there for the community. Their function is to stop community resistance, that’s what they’re there for. And we all knew that. A reporter submitted a FOIL request for their emails and that’s exactly what they confirmed, basically—that they never even considered our perspectives. We were able to put together an alternate Community Plan—at the City’s request, saying that this is something we should be doing! The idea was, we’re not going to just say no, no, no to the rezoning. I knew development was going to happen, and most people did, but we didn’t want our whole business district decimated. What the reporter found in the emails was that EDC communicated one-to-one with developers. Developers emailed, “I want this change,” and EDC responded. The reporter, a young guy, goes to me, sincerely, “Did you have this kind of back-and-forth with the EDC?” And I was like, “No, of course not!” All they would say is, “Just hang on, later in the process is when we make the changes.” So, you see that this was for the owners, and a big waste of people’s time. April De Simone: I think what stands out is what did change with EDC. I think what you were saying captures the humanization process that we’re talking about. Individuals are put in these positions of authority and come in and change community experiences, but if they are unable to humanize the community, then it becomes much easier to detach themselves from the results of their work. And this has been the case throughout history—this is not a different tactic, this is not something that just started now, it’s been like this since the inception of planning and land speculation. Moving forward with the coalition—because it’s happening anyway, the cost of living is increasing dramatically—what do you think are going to be outputs or tactics that are going to manifest in the built environment that are going to build upon equitable and inclusive experiences? GC: Well, first let me just address what you said about humanization and dehumanization. One of the weird things about the EDC is how detached they are personally. They’re also very thick-skinned. They come in and get yelled at by the community, and essentially have no reaction. NL: We would yell in their faces, and they would just—nothing. GC: With the real estate industry in general, there’s a distance that’s created. We never see the property owners and they don’t see us, and that makes it easier. That’s how I know that they know somehow, on some level, that they’re committing bad acts. Their distance from it is a tell. But with the second part of your question, I think we altered the conversation a little bit, especially around affordability. We and other organizers around the city have driven home what affordability is and isn’t. The Mayor’s HUD-based concept of affordability, AMI, is just not realistic. That’s something that we hammered home. We made a case for deep affordability and for using public land as a place to do really deep affordability. “We and other organizers around the city have driven home what affordability is and isn’t.” We won contextual zoning, which is a weird thing because contextual zoning in many cases is an exclusionary tactic to keep out low-income people. But we said, “A tool is a tool; it depends on whose hands it’s in.” In this case, we saw it as a tool to limit developers’ incentive to snatch up properties and develop soft sites into luxury houses. Our goal was to try to do our best to mitigate the market pressures somewhat. I don’t know how successful we were in doing that, but time will tell. Where they are going to build in Inwood is going to be mostly on industrial sites. As EDC had determined, there would be little direct displacement. And I shouldn’t say little—I think it’s like 200, and that’s a lot. AD: And they always underestimate the displacement. GC: And what they don’t estimate, and there’s a lawsuit over it, is indirect displacement. They calculate anybody who’s in a rent-regulated apartment as secure, which is—I could laugh. It’s ridiculous. As tenant organizers, we spend all our time protecting rent-regulated apartments because of all the different mechanisms that exist to get them out of their apartment. My building just got hit with two Major Capital Investments (MCI’s), and they are illegally deregulating apartments. So, to say that people in rent-regulated apartments are secure is not true. Our goal was always to limit the number of people that would be uprooted. Because nobody was caring about the people already here; everything was about who’s coming in. Our goal is to give people a foothold and to lessen the pressure on them. We were demanding more tenant organizing money; we didn’t get all that much. There were a lot of other demands that we wanted along with this, plus a lot of us are already engaged in the rent reform battle. But I would say, just put very simply, our goal is to keep people in their apartments and not create such an alien environment. That’s one of the reasons, too, that we pushed for contextual zoning. They were looking at, like they’ve done in other parts of the city, building these giant glass buildings. And you look at a neighborhood like Inwood, and people are sitting outside, they’re connecting, people know each other. Then you drop this doorman building down with residents who will say, “Oh, these guys blasting merengue or playing dominos are scaring me.” Then the building’s doorman will call the cops, and now you have the cops coming over. It disrupts the street life, it disrupts the community, it disrupts the culture. That’s another thing we were extremely concerned about. And we still are. Our goal is to keep people in their apartments and to limit the number of luxury units. I think there are tangible human and cultural issues when you have such massive amounts of wealth coming into this neighborhood. NL: Do you see any similarities between the ways that your tenants’ association has been engaging with your landlord, for example, and the way that we engage with the City in general on the rezoning fight? GC: Well, there’s no communication with the de Blasio administration! In three years, he never came to Inwood once. But when we communicate with our landlord, again, there’s no direct communication. The landlords don’t talk to us. I mean, we’re suing; we have a class action suit against them. We did have a pretty big win—we got a bunch of apartments reregulated. So, you do get your victories here and there. There’s so little communication. But I think that this is where the mass pressure from organizing works. Even if they don’t directly speak to us, you can see their rhetoric change. I think Francisco Moya was a good example, where for the first time, the Chair of the City Council subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises put out a scathing letter about the problems with rezonings. That was in response to the Inwood rezoning. For the first time, you weren’t just hearing, “Oh, these are great ways to create affordable housing.” It was a demand that people start to see the problems in the zoning. NL: But it took a lot to get there because we had individual meetings with as many council members from the Zoning Committee and from Land Use that will give us the time of day. We shared our platform; we shared the research. We had tenants go and share their stories of how much they’re at risk, even though EDC is claiming that they’re not at risk. We clocked in a lot of hours at City Hall and inviting them to the community to come around and talk to the people. Co-op City. Image credit: formulanone via Flickr. AD: I don’t know if you read recently that the National Housing Coalition is touting Co-op City as one of the exemplary model developments for the limited equity co-op, that you could buy for $20,000 and live there. Here’s the situation of what you were speaking about with the disconnectedness: for so long people have been saying, “We did Amalgamated, we did Co-op City, why haven’t we recreated those similar models?” All this development that has come in, not one has simulated what they did. And it’s this disconnect. You’re telling white progressive liberals that there are models out there, why aren’t you advocating for these? And when you say it, the response is, “Oh, that’s impossible, it was a different time.” And then all of a sudden now, everybody’s starting to talk about the limited-equity co-op. Those very same people that said, “No, no, no, we can’t do that.” You’re on the front lines with this activism. How do you call this out in these circles? GC: Let me just back up one second, because there’s a weirdness about my background. I’m also a major gift fundraiser. So, I deal with the very, very wealthy donors, and a lot of them are real estate donors. Some of them are the nicest people to talk to, absolutely lovely people if you get to know them. But they are just so disconnected. They’re not evil; they just don’t know. Poverty is abstract, all of these problems are abstract. They know they exist, and then they think that there’s a fix. Many are very involved in these fixes where they think, “The system benefits me, it’s going to ultimately benefit everyone else.” It’s a humanity problem. Because the thing is, if this real estate person, who I’m convinced is a decent person, was in the community and got to know people in the community, there would be a difference. I genuinely think that. NL: Something that we’ve been also talking about is what we think people should do about this. There’s always a distance between folks who are in power, the people who are powerful and wealthy, and those of us who are not and who feel the impact of not only their amassed wealth but also the decisions that they get to make every day about the issues. They decide what the fixes are, and they go in between the system that has allowed them to prosper right at the expense of others. Do you think that there is this understanding that they are only where they are at because a lot of people don’t get access to the same resources and opportunities? Do you think that’s something that can be changed through a conversation? Or do you think that there’s more that needs to be done to break down those elements for them? GC: The irony that I noticed in dealing with the wealthy is that they all consider themselves very good, especially if they’re liberals and progressive, and they consider themselves on the right side of things. I mean, it’s a lot of paternalism, an idea that people just don’t get it. Their attitude is that we don’t get how the world is, but they do. You’d have to have quite a conversation. It also depends on the person. Some of them are self-made people. They have their attitude of, “Well, I made it, other people can make it too.” The old pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps idea. Although they have more of a grounding in the realities, they just think that everybody has to shape up. When it comes down to the ones who grow up with wealth, they still believe it could be all fixed through a gentler form of— NL: —of change. They don’t think that they must give up anything to do it. Alp Bozkurt: What does housing justice mean to you? GC: It’s a simple thing. We want to remove the fear that people have in their lives; remove the suffering and what it does to children, what it does to neighborhoods, what it does to friends, what it does to families. We’ve got to stop displacement. And on the local level, how are we going to stop it? As far as the bigger picture, I don’t see how a system where owners are far, far removed… I think of it like The Matrix, where they have people in those pods and they’re sucking their energy out. That’s what I feel renters are like. We’re in our pods and they’re just sucking money out. And it’s like, how many more ways to get the money out are there? “Let’s turn it up, turn it up, get more money out of it!” It’s such a commodity—how do we squeeze every dollar out of this? If you’re in a situation where housing is this kind of relationship, it’s so dysfunctional. It’s dehumanizing. It’s been going on for millennia. I don’t necessarily know how to fix it. I’m a believer in finding ways for people to be owners. I mean you can see the difference in how they treat owners. In Inwood, one area that was not touched—in fact, it received a historic district—was where all the co-ops are. We have friends there, people who help us out. But it’s always been like that in history. You know, the landowners could vote. Having that kind of stake gives you more power over your own life. I’d like to see more people having ownership, as opposed to just being at the mercy of property owners.

39,Shelter for All: An Interview with Marcus Moore & Rob Robinson,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-an-interview-with-marcus-moore-rob-robinson/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity. Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. The following interview with Marcus Moore, an artist and activist known as The Homeless Poet, and Rob Robinson, cofounder and member of the Leadership Committee of the Take Back the Land Movement and staff volunteer at the National Economic and Social Rights Initiative (NESRI), accompanies Systemic Radical Change. Read the full set of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. April De Simone: Rob, I think your story is powerful for so many reasons. How did your journey start? Rob Robinson: What I went through transformed how I think and see the world. I was raised in a working-class Long Island family. Dad was a chef and then a restaurant owner. My mom didn’t work when we were kids. I went to the University of Maryland on a college scholarship to play football. I started out working in the restaurant business when I was 18 years old, and I worked as a chef at well-known restaurants in New York. I was the executive banquet chef at Tavern on the Green. Eventually, I had to get off my feet, so I went into customer service working at an insurance company for a friend of my Dad’s, and then eventually landed a job at ADP. At ADP, I worked myself up the ranks. They put me through an IT program and I became a project manager overseeing a piece of software that ADP said “would guide the company’s growth in the new millennium”. In March 2001, after 13 years of employment, I was asked to move to Miami to oversee the installation of the new software and beta testing in a new division of ADP. When I got down there, they give me a car to drive and a hotel to sleep in for three months and a $10,000 relocation fee. I’m sleeping like a king. Then, on July 1, 2001, I got called into the manager’s office and was told, “there’s no more money in the budget for your position. We’re going to have to let you go.” I was kind of cocky at the time, confident: “I got this job, I’ll get another job.” I hadn’t done any homework on Miami. Miami was going through tough economic times in the early 2000s. I got a year of severance pay and unemployment. That ran out. I started to tap into a bank account; that ran out. Before you know it, I tapped into a 401k, wiped that out, and I was on the streets of Miami. I spent two and a half years on the streets of Miami, just struggling to get by every day, panhandling when I could, begging for food. At an intake center in Miami beach, I told the outreach team that I was from Long Island. A few days later, they put me on a bus with some food and a couple of dollars in my pocket and sent me back to New York City. Eventually, I reached the Port Authority bus terminal. But the last part of that trip was to go from Port Authority to Hempstead, Long Island, where my family would greet me. I got to Port Authority, looked in the mirror, and I was unshaved and a little bit unkempt, and I felt a little embarrassed. The whole two and a half years, I never told my family that I lived in the streets. I would call my sister every Sunday, “Hey sis, how you doing?” and hang up the call. Even if I had to panhandle to just get $1 to make that call. I found it difficult to tell my family of my situation. I was the first person in my family to graduate high school and a university. All the problems in the family were always put in my lap, and I was always told, “figure it out. You’re the smart one, you’re the one with the education.” My dad would repeatedly say that. So, I said “They can’t figure this out. I’m going to have to figure this out on my own.” I get back, go to Port Authority bathroom, don’t like the way I look, so I ask somebody, “Where can I go to get cleaned up?” They point to a shelter called the Open Door, which was on 40th Street and 9th Avenue. I spent 10 months there and finally came out, as I like to say, transformed. I said to myself, “everything I was taught—I gotta empty my head and I have to re-learn life again.” As I was going through the shelter and coming out, everybody kept saying, “you’re homeless because you don’t want to work. You’re homeless because you don’t have an education. You’re homeless because you have a chemical addiction. You’re homeless because you have a mental illness.” I’m like, wait a minute, I worked since I was nine years old and I went homeless after working for 35 years. I have a college degree from the University of Maryland. I was never diagnosed with mental illness and I don’t have a chemical addiction. This is a lot of bullshit. And there’s got to be more people like me, so I have to find them. I just started speaking out. The first chance I got to speak out was at a conference at Columbia University. I made a statement to the audience that day. I said, “I came to this theory on my own: gentrification leads to displacement, which leads to homelessness, which leads to criminalization.” Neil Smith, a distinguished professor of Anthropology and Geography at the City University of New York Graduate Center was sitting in the audience and stood up and said, “say that again?” And I said, “Gentrification leads to displacement, which leads to homelessness, which leads to criminalization.” And he said, “Can we meet after this? I want to know how you came up with that theory.” And Neil said to me, “What you’ve experienced and learned, a lot of other people need to learn from you. I want you to come to speak to my class.” Well, Neil was teaching at the CUNY Grad Center. I said, “Me speaking to Ph.D. students?” And he said, “Just because you don’t have a piece of paper doesn’t mean you don’t have any knowledge to share. My students can learn as much from you as they can from me. So, come on up and talk to my students.” He made me a regular lecturer in his class. He had this theory that knowledge is something that is shared. Functionally, the academy goes out into the community to learn, the community comes into the academy, and it’s a wheel that constantly turns. Rob Robinson speaks to Forefront cohort. Nova Lucero: One of the ideas that came out your work with Take Back the Land was that the human right to a home outweighs the right of a landlord to make a profit. I feel that this idea completely throws off people’s worldview, especially those who believe in capitalism. Why would we take away the ability to make money? RR: Let me go back to why Take Back the Land was formed, to help you understand where we were coming from. When the housing bubble collapsed in the late 2000s, President Obama said that big banks couldn’t fail, so we’re going to take your tax money and support Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and all of these other banks. Then those banks started foreclosing and evicting us in record numbers. But in a state like New York, once you get evicted—first, you had to buy an insurance policy that’s going to guarantee that you pay off that mortgage—the bank got paid off even though they evicted you; now they have the house too. They’re profiting twice. That turned my stomach. And it was happening primarily to people of color, who were probably given a predatory loan, to begin with. You were set up to fail, no matter which way you looked at it. Take Back the Land was founded on the principle that these were our houses, and we’re going to take them back. We would find houses that were foreclosed by a bank or government agency, break-in them, move in families, and defend their rights to stay using international human rights law. We have enough houses, right? During the height of the crisis, there were 14.4 million vacant homes and 2.3 million homeless people. We said, if we just play matchmaker, problem solved! Put the homeless people in the vacant homes. Alp Bozkurt: When are we going to reach a tipping point in the US for people to take action on housing? RR: I don’t know how you move people to action. I know for us at Take Back the Land, it’s like, take the shit back! The way you get a capitalist’s attention is to take their shit. You take back—you hit them in the pocket or you take their shit. And all of a sudden they want to talk to you! So, here’s a perfect example. During the height of the housing crisis, the housing movement in the US was divided. Take Back the Land was saying, “We need transformative organizing. We need to change the way we look at society.” At the same time, post-buyout, attorneys general from around the country sued the banks, and the banks offered principal reduction. So, if you bought a house in 2005 and it was worth $300,000, you took out a mortgage from a bank and in 30 years you’ll pay back $400,000, or whatever it is. Come to 2008, here’s the economic downturn, your house is now worth $200,000. But the greedy bank is still asking for the mortgage on $300,000. So, the people started demanding principal reduction. At Take Back the Land, we said, principal reduction is not going to transform the world. You can get principal reduction; it will give you some immediate relief. But, you won’t build a movement, because we’re a selfish society: “Okay, I got mine. Have a nice day! Thanks for the principal relief! Thank you for everything! See you!” Many groups took a principal reduction from the banks. We at Take Back the Land said, “Unless you put that house in a land trust, we’re going to shut down the bank branch closest to that house. You won’t do any business. We don’t want any fucking principal reduction. It’s not going to change anything.” Because if we give everybody principal reduction, five years down the road, you create another financial crisis, and we’re going back to, “Oh, can I get principal reduction please?” They’re jerking you around. “We always said the human right to a home outweighs the right of a landlord or speculator to profit off a home.” We said, “That’s not going to change anything.” The way you create fundamental change is by altering that relationship to land and housing. The only way we can do that is to remove land and housing from the market. As long as they’re market commodities, there are going to be problems in this country. This means the only way you’re going to change the equation is for the 99% to rise up and take back the shit. It’s simple. You gotta rise up and take it back! Folks get freaked out by language like that, but at some point, there’s got to be a social clash to take back the land. We always said the human right to a home outweighs the right of a landlord or speculator to profit off a home. That’s going to challenge civil rights law, and that’s because we’re looking through the lens of human rights law when human need outweigh civil rights. Laws are written to benefit a select few. They’re not always written to benefit the masses. NL: A theme for our exhibit is about challenging the dehumanization of these systems, and how they take the “people” out of it. When we’re talking about creating housing, when we’re talking about even how to defeat the homelessness crisis, they fail to mention people. Marcus, I wanted to get your thoughts on how you’re using art to challenge that. I think that this form of art is a different way that gets to people that sometimes just standing up in front of a room and talking to people doesn’t quite reach. Marcus Moore: I take a lot of experiences with people, especially people who have been pushed out of their communities, and get into the heart and mind of folks. I still eat at soup kitchens with the people. I get a chance to take these real-life talks and put them into monologues. It gives a different perspective to those who hear these misconceptions that homeless people are crazies. I get a chance to bridge the gap because people from all walks of life come to my shows. People of the faith-based communities love holding my events. I’m humbled. But I even get on them, because I have one skit where the person, who is a homeless man, is having a problem with his leg. And some churches and places, they got all this property, and for some reason, they don’t see any reason to help when it comes to housing. If they do, it’s only a weekend. This particular character is being kicked out, because the Reverend at the church says, “It’s Monday morning, you gotta get out of here.” The character is telling the Reverend—I got a dummy dressed as a reverend—and the Reverend is trying to tell him nicely, “Listen, go to where you go, go to the shelter, go wherever.” And the character is telling the Reverend, “Listen, Reverend, you know what happened to me last time in the shelter? They beat me up and they stole my cellphone.” So, the character goes on, and the Reverend is just, “No, no, no,” and the character busts out in frustration and tears and hurt and says, “I don’t need any more pantry.” He doesn’t need any more pantry! He needs a place to be! AD: I love what you’re saying. It’s like, “I don’t want to be at a pantry. I want to be something more humanized. What can I be empowered to do?” I feel so helpless sometimes, in the sense that, everyone would rather just act like homelessness is not there, or just making a comment on how people who are homeless smell. RR: I would rather somebody tell me that you don’t want my help than to not approach them. Tell me to go away. Okay, I know I made an attempt; at least I can walk away saying I tried. I think a lot of us give up once they’ve pushed us away and there’s a part of me that understands it—not necessarily agrees with it, but understands it. I’ve made an attempt, what else can I do? Everybody’s different. I don’t think there’s a one-size-fits-all answer. I think people are different. Sometimes it takes constant engagement, and eventually, somebody gives in and sees the good in you, and says, “Okay, I’ll go where you want me to go. I’ll do what you’re asking me to do.” A lot of us often don’t want to commit time, and that’s generally what it takes. It takes some time because you’re going to have to build a relationship. NL: I think that building a relationship is the hardest thing to do. It’s much easier to give people money, or to a pantry. I remember we had this woman from the New Destiny Housing, and she said, “It’s important to go and ask people, ‘Do you want some help? Do you need some help?’” Just because somebody is in a situation that others might deem traumatic doesn’t mean that today is the day. Everybody has their own journey and it might take some time to figure out what they need and when they need it and when they want to start. RR: Here’s what I’m going to say. Even at a shelter, I don’t think they’re intentionally trying to treat you badly. They may not do all the right things for a number of reasons. I think their overall intention is a good one. For whatever reason, the results may not be the best, whether it be finances—and usually, it’s money that is driving the results. I know people will dispute this, but I think the City is making a genuine attempt to do better with respect to homelessness and “meet people where they are.” So, if someone asks for help, you should be calling 311. That’s going to initiate a response from Bowery Residents Committee or Urban Pathways. And 311 should initiate a response. The one good thing about 311 now is they should be giving you a tracking number, and you should be asking for that number before you get off the phone. If you have to call again about that person, you should be referring to that number because then the history is recorded, and then the delivery service can be challenged whether it’s been delivered in the correct way. Emma Silverblatt: Rob, can you tell us more about what you’ve been able to achieve through the Coalition on the Continuum of Care? RR: One of the things we’ve pushed through is called coordinated assessment. The shelter industrial complex that was built in New York didn’t assess people well at the front door. They mixed people in the wrong way. From the time they came to the City looking for a bed and when the City committed to giving them a bed, the system sends people in bottlenecks and down wrong avenues. Now, by taking this problem outside of New York, you can take somebody with lived experience from here to DC and say, “Y’all are giving the City all this money, but they don’t do a coordinated assessment. They’re constantly sending people down the wrong avenues and pouring your money in a hole.” Now HUD is forcing New York, starting in January, to do something called coordinated assessment. You have to prove to HUD that you sent them down the right avenues. It’s a whole different world for New York. So, if the shelter puts somebody at the front door, and let’s just say, for argument’s sake, they’re paying me minimum wage, do you think I care who is who and what avenue I send you down? I just need to send you someplace. I need to checkboxes on a piece of paper and send that paper on its way, because I need to be shuffling paper. But now you’re forced to have the right people at the front door. It’s not going to make it perfect, I’ll be the first one to tell you. But some of the fun that I have, is taking that voice outside—as we like to say, to a higher authority. We go to a higher authority: HUD. “New York is fucking up, look! Tell them to straighten their shit up or pull that money back.” $120 million—that’s a lot of money for New York City. AD: Can you both share more about your experience in the shelter system? Since we’re focusing on the dehumanization of people, and how people are treated in these experiences, and then reduced to numbers and all of that—what is it about these systems that is glaring for you? RR: They’re impersonal. They make you a number. You’re a statistic, you’re data. Data is important, I’ll be the first one to tell you. However, they dehumanize you at the front door. If you don’t fit in this box, then you can’t go here, you have to go to Bellevue Intake, or somewhere else. For me, my thought wasn’t to stay at the shelter for a long time. I went to that place to take a shower. And then it didn’t seem so bad. It beat the street. I got a locker. There are two televisions, one showing sports, one showing movies, and there are three square meals here. I found myself, after a week, organizing inside of that shelter to change the conditions. That’s what started my organizing. It was the Executive Director of Urban Pathways, Fred Shack, who came to the facility to shake the hands of the guys that were writing him these letters and saying, “Your organizing needs to go to a higher level. You can have a bigger effect on homeless services and how it’s delivered in New York City.” And he sent me to the Coalition on the Continuum of Care. Image credit: Marcus Moore with Forefront Fellow Nova Lucero. MM: When I was at the shelter, it seemed to me to be a holding place. I couldn’t understand what was the next step for people to move on from this place? I knew that people after a while became desperate and would do almost anything to get housing. Once a fellow told me, “I know that I have to either get some housing from one of these caseworkers, or I will return back to the street.” This person said to me, “Marcus, yo man, take the pill, take the pill. And once the doctor turns his back, just take it out, spit it out.” But once you put in these pills, that will decide where they’re going to put you and what you’re diagnosed with. When I went to the shelter, I was still pretty much a healthy dude. I felt good, but it was a mental shock to see how long you have to be on this to get housing. It could be years before you get called. I remember never really being assessed properly. Anything could’ve happened to me in the dorms, with individuals who are just going through a tough time and looking for an outlet, like a punching bag, because there are no punching bags on the facility. You rub some of these individuals wrong, and they can take it out on you—the whole six to seven months of their frustration. Once I realized the form of desperation for getting housing, I couldn’t get down with that. I’m not taking any drug pills. I knew right then and there that guys were doing this to be able to get housing faster. If they have to attend meetings in these places, as far as they’re concerned, at least they have their housing. But I realized that follows you the rest of your life, and I can’t do that to myself. I came across some information for Picture the Homeless. I think it was in the cafeteria. From then on, for me, where I was at was just a holding facility and a dead end for people who wanted to move forward. If you didn’t develop a revolutionary mind, or an underdog mind—“I’m gonna do this regardless of what!”—then you would be dependent on a system that just looks at you as a federal check. And that can be a revolving door. RR: I also saw the shelters as a warehouse, of storing bodies, because I came in there with something of a work history. I was bugging my caseworker about a resume: “Type this up for me. I need to keep moving on.” I was a little bit of an enigma for her, and some of those things they make you comply with, I wasn’t doing them. The only good thing that came out of it for me was them putting me on disability. “You clearly have a disability, file for disability.” But the mentality that they use was, “Here’s the form, it’s 11 pages. I have to help you with it.” “Excuse me. Why do you have to help me? I can fill this out.” So, she gives it to me and she says, “Okay, sit down and try to fill it out.” I had it filled out in about 10 minutes. It’s repeating the same information page after page. “Oh, you must’ve made a mistake, because you filled it out too quickly.” There’s a way they treat you and think about you in these facilities, which put me at odds with the caseworker. I saw a lot of people who needed a caseworker, but I’m not going to knock on your door just to interact with you. Tell me where to go and I’ll go. You don’t have to have a caseworker lead me down to 125th Street. I can figure out how to get there on my own. So, I understood a lot of what you just laid out, Marcus, and I’ve seen the way they interacted with the people that were in the facilities. And I hear what you’re saying about dangers. The Open Doors shelter was an open space. You felt that way, but there were about eight of us that stood in the back of the facility, so, there were seven people that had my back constantly. If you mess with one of us, you had to mess with the four of us. We set a tone in the place. And we were so serious about how we operated. That’s probably how I survived because I will say—people talking about the challenges and the dangers—but I had support in a way. People had our backs. The experience was a little bit different. But I agree with you. People come in, they’re angry. But you also have security guards. You had Kingsley, who was about 350. You come in and you mouth off, Kingsley will bounce you off those walls in a minute. Many a time, we’ve seen a guy come in a little drunk, mouth off to Kingsley: “I tell you to sit your ass down. You want to challenge me?” Bouncing off the walls and nobody saw anything. He was acting up, and Kingsley gave him what he was supposed to get. I agree with you about the warehousing people. It seemed like people were stuck there. And that was my biggest fear because you hear people are here for two years. And I’m like, man, two years of this shit? No, man, I gotta get out of here.

Fellows developed original design and policy proposals on how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies, which we are pleased to publish alongside interviews with leading experts. Read the full compilation of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. By Daniel McPhee and George Piazza This compilation presents the work completed by the Urban Design Forum in 2018-19 addressing the recent homelessness crisis in New York City. The Forum is first and foremost a membership organization, a venue for the civic-minded to debate challenges facing the contemporary city. Our fellows are a growing and metamorphosing array of designers, developers, planners, activists, lawyers, scholars, and technologists–in pursuit of more vibrant, verdant and just places. Created in 2016, the Forefront Fellowship is an annual program cultivating emerging leaders in urban design, advocacy, development, and policy. Each year, 20 diverse professionals investigate how design can address a critical social or political challenge facing New York City. At the start of each Fellowship, the Forum partners with a city agency or nonprofit organization to address a specific challenge in the built environment. Fellows conduct site visits, engage stakeholders and produce a project that leverages their interdisciplinary expertise. Throughout the rest of the program, Fellows work in independent teams to explore broader questions within the topic area. The 2018-19 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, was the Forum’s response to the increasing homeless population in New York City and the City’s renewed efforts to revamp their approach. In 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio released “Turning the Tide on Homelessness in New York City” as a response to the growing population and changing nature of housing precarity. Their plan consisted of a three-pronged approach to 1) keep people in their homes 2) improve services 3) dignify the shelter system. Central to dignifying the shelter system was their plan to develop design and operations practices to improve the existing shelter stock, known as Conscious Shelter Design Guidelines (CSD.) The City presented us with the opportunity to work on the CSD project as a chance to reflect on the shelter typology and consider how we could retrofit existing shelters to better support residents across the city. From May to July 2018, our Fellows partnered with the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) and the American Institute of Architects – New York (AIA-NY), to visit 15 shelters, interview 60+ stakeholders, and draft over 200 pages of design recommendations to improve existing shelters across New York City. We are incredibly thankful to the DHS and AIA-NY staff who gave their time to assist with this project, particularly: Hunter Gradie, Robbie Cowan, Shifra Goldenberg, Benjamin Prosky, and Adam Roberts. Equipped with the knowledge from their summer work with DHS, our Fellows developed independent projects exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity in New York City. From September 2018 to April 2019, Fellows organized evening events, interviewed community leaders, studied case studies, and developed original design and policy proposals that they presented on April 16, 2019, at the New Museum to NYC Department of Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks and over 120 Forum members. This compilation presents the original design and policy proposals developed by the Fellows and their interviews with subject-matter experts about how to address the prison-to-shelter pipeline, public bathrooms, public realm management, supportive housing, and racist housing policies. Each chapter of this compilation features the Fellows’ original projects and interviews with several leaders in the homelessness and housing worlds, including Rob Robinson, Judy Whiting, Marcus Moore, Jonathan Marvel, Jessica Katz, Gia Biagi, and more. The compilation concludes with an essay reflecting on the Forum’s year-long investigation into today’s homelessness crisis and a statement on the value of design in homeless shelter and the public realm. Our aim in presenting these ideas is to ignite a debate about how to build a more just and equitable city for people experiencing homelessness and housing precarity. We hope you will share your ideas with us."
41,Shelter for All: A Note from the Fellows,https://urbandesignforum.org/shelter-for-all-a-note-from-the-fellows/,"July 24, 2020","The Urban Design Forum’s 2018 Forefront Fellowship, Shelter for All, addressed the homelessness crisis in New York City by examining how to dignify the shelter system through better design and exploring the root causes of homelessness and housing precarity.

Read the full compilation of Shelter for All proposals and interviews here. By Nova Lucero and Emma Silverblatt This work is not original. For decades our unhoused neighbors have been mobilizing their own efforts to create permanent affordable housing for those living in NYC shelters, drop-in centers, overcrowded apartments, and on the streets. This work is not a solution to New York City’s homelessness crisis. The solution does not lie in our projects, although some of our work does reveal the deep roots of its cause. Over a year since our Fellowship’s conclusion, many of us have come to realize the value of this experience as an opportunity to learn about the entrenched systemic causes of homelessness, and to recognize how our actions are complicit in preserving them. This is a call-in. To all of the architects, landscape architects, planners, developers, public officials, scholars, activists, lawyers, and journalists who live in New York City: it will take the effort of each of us to eliminate homelessness. But we must use our money, power, and positions in society to provide a platform for those directly impacted to lead the way. Our allyship lies in how we choose to use our resources, labor, and talents. If we make the choice to lift up the ideas, words, and efforts of those directly impacted, to respect their dignity as people who know best what they experienced and how to stop it, we can learn to aid the larger movement of peoples organizing for their liberation. Thanks to the Urban Design Forum, our 2018-2019 Forefront cohort was able to research the homelessness crisis, spending the first half of the Fellowship directly observing New York City’s solutions with the Department of Homeless Services before developing the projects highlighted in this digital release. These projects take on major issues in homelessness: exploring how access to public infrastructure like bathrooms can mitigate harm, proposing new potential sites for supportive housing, highlighting the violent connection between shelters and prisons, and questioning the need for shelters entirely, positing instead the decommodification of housing, to reframe it as a human right. In reviewing our work, please reflect on your relationship to White Supremacy and the patriarchy, and ask yourself, “How can I support real systemic change proposed by those who are impacted by homelessness?” In New York City, the African/Black, Latinx, immigrant, Trans and Queer youth communities are disproportionately impacted by homelessness, police brutality, and the health crisis of coronavirus. If you have paid attention to the riveting Black Lives Matters movement, then you know that we face a public reckoning. The actions you take, conscious or not, will disclose what side you are on. Our Fellowship work reveals the levers of power, the decks stacked against our neighbors upholding an inequitable reality. We implore you to take advantage of not only the ideas here, but the connections we have made with those doing the work, the organizations we have learned from, and instead of proposing solutions for others, pass the mic to them. We would like to share the words of New Yorkers quarantining in hotel rooms at this time, supported by the #HomelessCantStayHome GoFundMe campaign, who are calling on each of us to fund their permanent housing instead of violence at the hands of the NYPD. You can read their full statement here and donate to permanently house those New Yorkers currently homeless here: “None of us want to go back to the streets. And none of us want to be warehoused in the shelter system while the system collects thousands of dollars a month off of us with no concrete movement toward permanent housing…We didn’t need security, or extensive services – what we needed was a room to stay safe. Many of us have gotten jobs and been able to be more healthy as a result of being in these rooms…We thank our fellow New Yorkers for their support during this time and call on our City to keep our people off the street and provide permanent housing to the homeless.” Special Thanks Thank you to all who shared their knowledge with us from the perspective of their own lived experience including Jamel Woods at City Beet Kitchens; Project Renewal’s Culinary Arts Training Program; Khalil Cumberbatch, formerly of the Fortune Society; and April DeSimone of Designing the We, who worked with us each day. A special thank you to the powerful leadership of those organizing to end homelessness: the members and organizers of Picture the Homeless, including Marcus Moore, Lynn Lewis, and Rob Robinson. We hope you will join us to support them and their organizations. Thank you to the Urban Design Forum staff, especially Daniel McPhee and George Piazza, for their encouragement to dig deep and the freedom to be creative and bold. Te queremos.

42,Valuing Worker Ownership: An Interview with Maru Bautista,https://urbandesignforum.org/building-worker-cooperatives-an-interview-with-maru-bautista/,"July 21, 2020","In the fall, the Urban Design Forum will launch Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery. In partnership with Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson and the Mayor’s Office of M/WBE, our Fellows will conduct research on how to create economic opportunity for MWBEs and employee-owned businesses through climate investment, leveraging the new market for building energy retrofits created by Local Law 97. Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Maru Bautista, Director of the Cooperative Development Program at the Center for Family Life, we discuss the benefits cooperative ownership can have in a community, what kind of support new cooperatives require, and the resiliency of cooperative models. Daniel McPhee: Through the Center for Family Life, you have helped to incubate over 20 worker cooperatives, most notably Up&Go and Brightly Home Cleaning Services. Can you tell us a little bit more about the benefits of incorporating as a cooperative? Maru Bautista: When you incorporate as a worker cooperative, you inculcate a sense of solidarity and use the power of the group to support one another. In our mostly immigrant community in Sunset Park, a lot of people face exploitation in the workplace: people not getting paid well, wages getting lost. When people talk about the impact of joining a cooperative, the first thing they mention is not just the economic impact of seeing their wages double or sometimes triple, but the fact that they’re not alone. If something goes wrong in that job, they have the backing of the business and the backing of the group. Starting a business with more people also reduces the risk that one would take opening a business on their own as an immigrant in this country. Doing that collectively with technical assistance has been really good for women of color and immigrant communities. Furthermore, the democracy in decision-making fosters a sense of self and power. It impacts how the people in our community get civically engaged. DM: As you mentioned, much of your work has been with low-income and immigrant communities in Sunset Park. How does the cooperative model meet the needs of that neighborhood in particular? MB: The Center for Family Life has been in Sunset Park since 1978. As an organization, we’re entrepreneurial and always create programming that meets the needs of our community. This program arose from a need expressed to us by an ESL class. They said, “You have a workforce development program for people to get ready to find a regular employment, but you don’t have anything for us. We don’t speak English, and sometimes we don’t even have the level of education that a lot of employers are looking for. What can we be done for us?” People need better work, right? That’s an important need in our community and the worker cooperative model helps address that. “It is not just the economic impact, it’s a question of people power.” Systemically in this country, we try to isolate immigrant communities and push them away. The worker cooperative model—or what we have built now, which is more of a network of coops—really has a presence in the fabric of the community in Sunset Park. People know about the coops, and people know that through the worker ownership model, they can have their rights. It is not just the economic impact, it’s a question of people power. It’s absolutely necessary for our community. Then people get involved with the church, and they are more engaged with their kids and their education because they have more time to be with the children. DM: What are some of the toughest barriers to creating a worker cooperative? MB: I’ve been thinking a lot about this. Sometimes I think that the biggest challenge is business savviness, but you can fix that, and we do that with technical assistance and coaching. I would say the toughest barrier is time. The model for building coops needs to address the learning curve for people to be able to manage and govern on their own, which takes time. Can they afford to be engaged in an eight-month process to learn all of this and build the business model together, or do they have to work tomorrow because they need to put food on the table? Those considerations are important. Time is also important in thinking about how much capacity-building you’ll need to do for any given industry. Our choices about where to start coops have been about where there are the lowest barriers to entry. We will work with anybody who wants to start a coop, regardless of experience, regardless of how much capital they have. Together, they can get the capital that they need to start the business. But all the coops that we work with are low capital intensive, so they don’t even need to raise that much money to begin with. Some people will tell you the biggest barrier money, but even with access to money, you still need time. DM: The Center for Family Life’s incubation model is really notable in terms of how you work with cooperatives. Could you talk a little bit more about the incubation services that you provide and the infrastructure that you offer to help these businesses form? MB: We start by doing a feasibility study, so that we know what we’re getting ourselves into: What does the market look like? Is there a need for this particular industry or business? What are the requirements legally and insurance requirements? Once we complete that and feel like there’s some feasibility to enter that market with the particular community that we’re working with, we invite people to an info session, where we talk about what we’re trying to do. Then we invite people to come to an intensive weekend. After that, we meet weekly, where we do a combination of workshops and tasks. People work in different missions, such as getting all of the financial pieces ready, getting a bank account, and making sure everybody has an ITIN number. They participate in workshops to understand how to do business finances, budgeting, all of those things. We also partner with lawyers that understand coops. Halfway through the process, they come and help the coops create their operating agreement. Members of the Brightly residential and commercial cleaning services cooperative franchises.

One person on my team is assigned to develop these trainings, adapt them to the needs of this particular coops, and meet with them weekly until they launch. It’s a long journey. DM: How you communicate the value of cooperatives, not to the workers themselves, but also to clients? MB: It is about quality and social justice. First, quality: because the workers are the owners of the business, they are so invested in the quality of the service that they’re providing. Nobody is going to do a better service than the worker-owners themselves. That has been a good marketing strategy and something that people value when booking services through all of the coops. The social justice component is a tricky one. We’ve often thought that this is not the most compelling reason for clients, but we’ve been proven wrong. People want to value the work that workers do and pay the wages that they deserve. We uplift the idea that workers are earning a fair wage or say what percentage of what people are paying goes directly to the coops. The idea of equity and distribution has been really helpful. But this is all in the service industry, where there’s a lot of precarity for most workers, so the values of worker ownership have been a good marketing strategy. Now, the coop model is better known in various sectors. People used to think about coops just as housing coops or the Park Slope Food Coop. There, the interaction as consumer-owners is not the same as with a worker-owner. One thing that has been interesting to see is that people don’t have high expectations of the management and administration of the business. They continue to think, “Because it’s a small coop, they won’t be efficient.” Creating marketing strategies to target that and building the model to be competitive in the market have been really important for us. We provide back office services for the coops that we support, so that checking email and responding to inquiries is not something we struggle with. Sometimes the workers themselves are not bilingual, or have difficulties taking on that task, so our model included this from the very early stages. DM: What kinds of policy changes would make it easier for cooperatives to form and be able to sustain their work? MB: There’s a policy group in New York CIty that is advocating for some changes in legislation at the state level. The current cooperative corporation statute is prohibitive to many communities, mainly because of the way individuals are taxed. None of the coops that we work with are registered as cooperatives, even though they could technically. That impacts the benefits they can get fiscally, for instance. A lot of the coops that we work with have to figure out how to work under the LLC model. Procurement has also been difficult. We are part of an initiative called the Worker Cooperative Business Development Initiative. We all work to develop coops, and we’ve all had a dream of procuring a contract with the city. But the system is just so difficult to navigate. The contracts go out super quickly and they’re gigantic contracts, so if you’re not already connected to a contractor to become their subcontractor, it is really hard to access. A lot of city agencies do not understand the worker ownership model, so things are not easy to do. For instance, a coop that we were supporting a few years back needed to get a construction license. There were twelve worker owners and one of them said, “I’ll be the one who takes the test on behalf of my coop,” but then there were all these little obstacles, like all the owners needed to be there for fingerprinting at the same time. The idea that businesses can be owned by multiple people is still not understood across agencies, and the systems that are built to serve businesses don’t really understand how to do that with worker cooperatives. The personal guarantee that a lot of different things require, like loans, is a battle, because how are you going to have a personal guarantee for twelve different people? Nobody can help us with that. It’s really hard to navigate. With the recent federal relief programs, there was a lot of advocacy to push for the removal of that clause so that it could be accessible to cooperatives in general. Luckily, we won and cooperatives were able to access those loans. Understanding the worker cooperative model, understanding that there can be more than one owner of a business and just making changes when it’s necessary would be really great. DM: I’m sure the current pandemic is impacting every single one of your cooperatives. What lessons are you learning about resiliency of the cooperative model in a moment of crisis? MB: So many things. I am inspired by the women that we work with every day. “There are more ideas coming out of a group that values people’s experience and knowledge.” Coops make decisions that are not just based on the economic need of the business. What happens with other businesses is that if you lose your revenue for a month, the first thing you do is to cut costs. You let people go. Coops can make decisions like not taking a draw if there’s no money in the bank, but they can stay in business, and they use the time to strengthen other areas of operation. In the case of the cleaning cooperatives that we’re supporting, the question is how do we pivot, and what opportunities are there to develop a new line of business? While our residential cleaning portfolio can’t be in operation because it’s not considered an essential service in New York City or New York State, our commercial cleaning is. How do we increase that? What kind of training do we need to get? What kind of marketing do we need to develop in order to take this as an opportunity to pivot, stay relevant, and continue to do business? I think there are a lot of advantages because of the members’ entrepreneurship and the network that they’re part of. It’s not easy, but they can use everybody’s skill set and everybody’s voice. There are more ideas coming out of a group that values people’s experience and knowledge, rather than just dissolving. What I think we are going to see in a few months is that the coops will bounce back. I don’t think the coops are going to lose members. Regular small businesses can’t do that; they will have to fire workers and then bring them back. But here, labor is so valuable that they are going to come back and rebuild.

43,Building a Shared Vision: An Interview with Sandra Lobo,https://urbandesignforum.org/economic-democracy-in-the-bronx-an-interview-with-sandra-lobo/,"July 21, 2020","In the fall, the Urban Design Forum will launch Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery. In partnership with Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives J. Phillip Thompson and the Mayor’s Office of M/WBE, our Fellows will conduct research on how to create economic opportunity for MWBEs and employee-owned businesses through climate investment, leveraging the new market for building energy retrofits created by Local Law 97. Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Sandra Lobo, Executive Director of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, we discuss how Northwest Bronx connects its organizing around racial, environmental, and health justice to an economic democracy framework that draws on longstanding cooperative practices in communities of color. Katherine Sacco: For those who may not be familiar with economic democracy, could you explain what that concept is? How does economic democracy intersect with the racial justice work that you’re doing at Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition? Sandra Lobo: I talk about economic democracy as a framework around building shared wealth and ownership, and collective governance over our community assets. There are obvious strategies, like a community land trust that we’ve incorporated, or cooperative enterprises included within this framework. There are other policy-based strategies that we’re employing as well. Northwest Bronx has been organizing around really critical issues since 1974. Although we’ve used a variety of strategies, we have largely focused on a fight-back, defensive posture—fighting bad landlords, bad development, bad actors—rather than implementing our own vision. Economic democracy invited us to ask, what is the vision that we want to see, and how does that shape the organizing we do? What are we going to be fighting for? When we went through the economic democracy training series developed by BCDI [Bronx Cooperative Development Initiative], we shifted our mission to explicitly name economic democracy as part of our mission as well as racial justice. Racial justice had always been a part of our analysis, but it had never been explicit. Given the changing landscape of the Bronx, we needed to name explicitly who was being most impacted and who was going to be at the center of decision making. KS: How do those two strategies of fight-back and fight-forward complement each other? What has adding the fight-forward strategies brought to what you’re able to do? SL: The fight-back and fight-forward strategies need to be hand-in-hand. For example, the Bronx is experiencing serious displacement and gentrification pressures right now. To get at the root cause, we need to be building shared ownership of the buildings, the land, and businesses. At the same time, we know that it takes time to build that kind of infrastructure. If we’re not careful and we’re not also employing protective and defensive strategies right now, by the time we create shared wealth and ownership enterprises, our people might be gone. The things that we’re building may not be for the people who we intended it for. The critical piece for us was acknowledging that if we didn’t intentionally create the capacity and the space to employ fight-forward strategies, we would always be focusing on the fight-back, because it feels like we’re under attack all the time and we have to defend and protect our people. If you don’t create the space, you’ll also never have actual time and capacity to do it. Northwest Bronx organizes community residents. Image credit: Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. KS: I read that Northwest Bronx arrived at workforce development as a community priority through a participatory process that started by asking about the biggest health problem, which was identified as violence, and then invited ideas on how to address the problem of violence. Can you describe more of that process? How did that process change or shape the way you approach workforce development? SL: We worked with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to engage in a participatory process to identify the number one health priority in our community. Over a year and a half, we engaged community members around the social determinants of health (SDOH). We are socialized to understand that if we are not healthy, that’s because we are not exercising or not eating right. Yet if you don’t have a grocery store with fresh fruits and vegetables, if you don’t have a space to exercise, or if you’re afraid to go outside to exercise, your health will be impacted. We weren’t surprised that violence was an issue, but we were surprised that violence was number one. Then we interrogated, if violence was the number one priority, what were we going to do about it? Through the SDOH lens, participants understood why people were engaging in the underground economy that led to violence. They understood that there was a lack of opportunity, lack of access to jobs that actually made it possible for people to take care of their families. It was within this context that workforce development was identified as the root cause of why there was violence. We ended up launching around Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which is the least sexy topic! KS: Why Integrated Pest Management? SL: Northwest Bronx has a 44-year-old Weatherization Assistance Program, the second largest in the state. During the former stimulus package, we received funding to train people for green jobs. The challenge for our community was that this investment came without an analysis around this sector at that time. We trained folks for green jobs, and at the end of the day, there were no businesses to employ them. We can provide training programs, but if we lack the larger infrastructure of building up a sector, then you’re going to have trained workers jobless, or securing jobs that are outside the borough, with a larger corporation, where the profits and the revenue go to its leadership and the investors. That approach does not have the impact that we’re actually seeking. “We want our people to have living wages, and we want our folks to be part of the decision-making at their workplace.” Integrated Pest Management was one of the strategies that emerged from our Healthy Buildings work. It is an evidence-based intervention that gets at the root causes of asthma triggers. It was exciting to have the Asthma-Free Act passed in City Council, which requires landlords to use IPM for people who have chronic asthma. But there weren’t that many local businesses that could take on Integrated Pest Management (IPM). If we were going to create the demand for IPM, we needed a larger ecosystem that would support businesses to take on trainees. For us, it wasn’t sufficient to have training for people in the community. We needed to identify a growing sector that also had a positive impact in our community. We want our people to have living wages, and we want our folks to be part of the decision-making at their workplace on the policies that impact the workers. The ideal for us is developing cooperative social enterprises or working with businesses that would be open to a conversion so that our workers share in the profits that they are producing. KS: Northwest Bronx’s Healthy Buildings program aimed to address root causes of poor health outcomes by improving buildings, but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy bills, and create jobs in the community. What has been the benefit of putting health concerns together with environmental concerns and jobs creation? SL: After we went through the economic democracy training series with BCDI, our membership was really interested in organizing around health and energy, but they were really clear that we needed to be careful that we weren’t going to create benefit in one sector and potentially undermine other parts of our communities. For example, with Healthy Buildings, were we going to implement energy efficiency retrofits that might ultimately displace our people because landlords could pass on the cost to low income tenants? No, we can’t do that. The financial tools that we use to address the energy retrofits have to be tied to a regulatory agreement that does not allow landlords to, for instance, pass down the debt to the tenants through what would traditionally be major capital improvements. And when we’re doing energy efficiency retrofits, we work with the landlords to identify bids from local businesses and we work with BronXchange at BCDI to vet the businesses that have the capacity to take on that work. When we first brought in more than 20 partners for the first planning of the program, every sector said, “This is too complicated! Why are you doing this?” Every sector is used to employing their own strategies within their sector. People are not used to sharing a vision and working collaboratively across sectors. It took two years of really building strong relationships. This took a lot of time, but for us it was really critical as we were committed to social transformation, not just impacting one sector. KS: What kind of response have you seen when you engage your community around economic democracy and cooperative ownership, whether it is the anchor institutions contracting out jobs, the business who might be considering switching to this model, or workers themselves? SL: Although we use the term economic democracy, some often used the “new economy”. But this approach is actually very old. Communities of color across the globe have developed cooperative economies to survive and flourish, including and especially Black communities in the U.S. It’s not a difficult concept for people to understand, in that communities have been accessing this tool all along. What has been missing is the infrastructure to provide credit and capital for these cooperative businesses of color to flourish. You might see cooperatives that are two or three people big, because they don’t have access to the technical assistance and the capital to grow. “Communities of color across the globe have developed cooperative economies to survive and flourish, including and especially Black communities in the U.S.” With our anchor partners and other institutional partners, they’re not resistant to the idea of cooperative enterprises, but they are worried that they are small, and just like any other small businesses, they ask if they can do the work or if they can show their experience and expertise. We are never going to get there if we don’t ever invest in them, so how do we begin to build the infrastructure that can help them flourish over time? KS: As we look towards the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, what role can worker cooperatives play? SL: Right now, we’re thinking about cooperative ownership not just in terms of worker cooperatives, but also housing cooperatives and shared governance over different assets in the community. Given that a lot of our folks are unemployed at home right now, how might this be an opportunity for training and leadership development so that when we’re coming out of this, we can invest in people who are ready to hit the ground? The small businesses in the Bronx have been completely decimated by this. The Bronx received 3% of the PPP loans from the stimulus package, and less than 1% from New York City’s Small Business Services fund. That doesn’t make any sense to us. We have been in conversations with our small businesses about, rather than closing, taking this opportunity to actually rethink their business in a different way, with other business owners as well, that might shift their approach to coming back after the quarantine is lifted.

44,No Opting Out: An Interview with Mark Chambers,https://urbandesignforum.org/no-opting-out-an-interview-with-mark-chambers/,"July 21, 2020","In the fall, the Urban Design Forum will launch Cooperative Works, an initiative exploring how New York City can advance economic justice in its coronavirus recovery.

Leading up to the program, we are pleased to publish a series of interviews with leaders in sustainability in the built environment, inclusive economic development, and racial justice. In our interview with Mark Chambers, Director of the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, we discuss the City’s efforts to implement Local Law 97, expanding the tent of climate resistance, and prioritizing environmental justice communities in the vision for a greener future. Daniel McPhee: How has your background in architecture has informed your leadership at the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability? Mark Chambers: Being an architect, I look at the work we do through the lens of the built environment. I’m able to visualize exactly what tools the city can use to improve that environment for all New Yorkers and for our planet. But it’s not just as a designer that I come to this conversation. I come to it as a public servant, as a parent and as a partner, too. So with that perspective, it’s also important to be able to think through what this moment needs. People do not live single-issue lives, so we cannot tackle the climate crisis without addressing systemic racism and inequality in the United States and around the world. For me, being able to think about how we design the future that we all deserve, is part of the architectural skill set. This lens is critical to how I view problem-solving, whether it’s three-dimensionally or with policy and legislation. DM: You mentioned the current moment. How has the pandemic impacted your approach to climate policy? MC: It has underscored the fact that social justice and climate justice are intertwined. If we’re not effectively confronting social justice and equity, then we’re going to be climbing up a larger hill of impacts in the face of a changing climate. Whether that is extreme heat, rising waters, or the chaos in between them, we have to be able to recognize that these things are fundamentally intertwined. That means we have to draw better connections between social infrastructure and our ability to respond effectively to climate change. For example, policies that enable universal Pre-Kindergarten are not separate from our work around climate change. Universal Pre-K creates stability for families and opportunities for a larger workforce to bend their skillsets towards climate resistance. It’s not just tree huggers like me that we need in that resistance; people who are working in finance, food systems, health systems, and transportation all have a role to play in this climate fight. DM: How do we ensure that New York City continues to move towards its climate goals in the midst of a difficult public health and economic crisis like the one we’re experiencing now? MC: It’s not easy. And I’ll be honest: the health crisis has not just exposed significant disparities, but it has also given us a good look at where our points of failure are. We have to acknowledge that and start to address it, but we also have to do it in a climate that fundamentally has less available cash at hand. For me, it has been important to lean into the COVID response to give ourselves insights into how to become better at climate adaptation response. I’ll give you an example of that. One challenge that is particularly pernicious right now is how our city deals with extreme heat. It is a constant and silent killer, and it’s amplified by the fact that we now have a pandemic where people can’t congregate. So if you’re in an apartment and you don’t have air conditioning, you can’t go to a cooling center where you might have been able to get some relief. “For me, it has been important to lean into the COVID response to give ourselves insights into how to become better at climate adaptation response.” The City met this challenge in a number of different ways. We directed our resources towards pursuing a program that distributes free air conditioners to low-income seniors. We’ve distributed about 30,000 air conditioners so far and working towards a total of 74,000. Simultaneously, we recognized that people will have additional electricity bills from running an air conditioner. To address that, we submitted, and won, a petition to the Public Service Commission at the state to get electric bill discounts for low-income New Yorkers as well. This program allows for us to have immediate, direct impact, and also consider and alleviate the cost burden. This effort has also been really critical for our team of climate specialists, designers, architects and planners to be closer to the populations we’re serving by actually being on the phone with the public and making sure that we’re understanding the critical points where our policy meets New Yorkers in their daily lives. That’s invaluable. DM: I know that it’s a little early to be thinking about recovery. But it’s clear that a lot of the communities that are most vulnerable to climate change are the ones that were historically redlined, that were slated for urban renewal, and that are today some of the hardest hit neighborhoods by the pandemic. And these are also neighborhoods that don’t typically get the same access to investment in green infrastructure, for instance. Over these next few months, how are you thinking about directing any kind of infrastructure investment into every neighborhood in New York, not just the ones that have traditionally seen the most investment? MC: We have a responsibility to make sure we’re distributing as many resources across the city as possible, and we have to prioritize communities that are particularly impacted, whether it’s by COVID or by systematic and historical racism and policies that have created fundamental obstacles to these communities being able to thrive. That’s part of our job, too. We have to acknowledge that the status quo is not equal. We have to seek out ways to directly target services that don’t just meet immediate needs, but also build capacity. A big piece of this is developing small businesses and making sure we’re prioritizing minority and women owned businesses, whether it’s around retrofits or distributed energy or solar installation. This way, we get people services that help them while also building businesses that come from those communities and help them to thrive. Investment in retrofits should expand beyond the City’s largest building in Midtown Manhattan. Image credit: Samuel Lahoz/Urban Design Forum. When it comes to prioritizing these communities within Local Law 97, our building retrofit mandate, my office has been tasked with developing a proposal for a carbon trading platform for the city. As one pathway to compliance with bringing your building carbon down to the caps, there may be a system that would allow for buildings that may not be able to meet the caps to purchase the capacity of retrofits elsewhere. There would be some prioritization in this market for low- and moderate-income areas, and environmental justice areas, to provide clear opportunities for investment in retrofits in those neighborhoods. This would economically benefit the system as a whole, but it also makes sure that in those neighborhoods people are benefiting from those investments physically, environmentally, and financially. If we get this right, and if we make sure that we’re clear on what the bottom line needs to be—which is net benefit to those communities—then we actually may have a best-in-class model for creating an economic platform for carbon trading. DM: I’d love to talk a little bit more about Local Law 97. Our project is really focused on what you’re just describing: how do we make sure that the economic benefits of that scale of climate investment serve minority owned businesses, workers of color and some of the most deeply impacted communities? How can we trigger that investment being shifted to MWBEs in particular? MC: Absolutely. That’s one of the chief drivers for how we structured the law. Being able to focus on business development for minority and women owned businesses is critical. Job training is also critical. We have a direct intervention point with this market through the NYC Accelerator, which provides free technical assistance to building owners to connect them to all the services they would need in order to retrofit their buildings. How do they know what they need to do? How do they find contractors? How do they prioritize different investments? How do they find incentives or capital? It’s a free $30 million program that’s relaunching this year, and the goal is to assist about 5,000 buildings. That program gives us opportunities to connect with building owners as well as businesses and job training in the retrofit market. We have a partnership with CUNY Building Performance lab, which has a goal of training and placing about 250 CUNY STEM students in internships and jobs that will address the growing demand that we’ve created by instituting this carbon cap across the city. We also work with public housing partners like Green City Force. They capitalize on the amazing skills and talents of NYCHA residents and employ them to assist with the retrofitting and work that’s happening throughout the NYCHA property. We’re also actively engaging with the trades to make sure they are prepared and building capacity as well. Through these types of programs, with additional capacity and potentially funding, we’re able to create a market not just for the work, but for the workers. The role of data will also be critical to showcase specific buildings or areas that need to work. We can try to use public disclosure responsibilities to activate the data in a way that might create more opportunities for people to mine it and figure out how they can provide those services to those building owners. DM: How has the launch of Local Law 97 been shaped, slowed, or challenged by the pandemic? MC: The pandemic has given us a bit of a pause to evaluate what we had planned in terms of community engagement and whether what we had planned on doing is the most effective strategy. We’ve always thought that the community engagement process relied on these large roundtable meetings at City Hall where we get really clear indication of how stakeholders think we can best implement these regulations and rulemaking. All these things that are still happening for Local Law 97. But I’m a parent, and it’s not easy to go to meetings that are at 6pm at night. What I’ve learned over the last several months is that there are opportunities within the confines of digital engagement that may be more convenient for more stakeholders to directly engage with the Mayor’s Office. For us, we’re committed to utilizing that to engage more clearly and more directly. I mentioned that we’re doing the carbon trading study. There’s a plan for a larger engagement around the environmental justice communities. Normally, it would have been one of those big meetings. Now, we’re looking at several meetings over time, which may garner even more debate, dialogue, and intel for us. That’s something I’m really excited about. We are not pushing back deadlines. We are doing everything we can to meet the moment of this climate emergency and give New Yorkers the clear direction that this crisis preceded the current crisis, and it will follow it. We need to make sure that we’re staying on task. The climate crisis is not taking a day off, so we’re not either. DM: I’d love to talk about some of the other aspects of the Climate Mobilization Act and some of your other recent policies. I know that the City recently put into place some new regulations about sustainable roofs, enacted new energy code, and is working to foster innovative solutions for building energy efficiency. What’s next on your agenda for the built environment? MC: We’ve been building these puzzle pieces that help unpack and repack our built environment. You have the roof optimization component where new buildings now have to have green roofs. You have this building retrofit law where buildings have to meet emissions caps. And then you have the energy code, which backs all of that up and makes sure that we’re changing the lexicon of how people are putting these buildings together. I’m excited that all of these things are also moving towards a point where we are considering larger amounts of electrification. “The climate crisis is not taking a day off, so we’re not either.” Fundamentally, we’re going to be in a place where people are reconsidering the currency of this conversation. That currency will be electrons in the future. How do you move electrons around? How do you utilize the few that you are able to get to do X, Y, and Z? How do you then monetize or transfer those to electric vehicles or to battery storage to use them when you want to? We’re working on how we can bring more renewables in to the city. Being able to paint a picture of New York’s future where we are electrified is really exciting. We want people to be able to see the benefits—for example, they can see the fact that if you have an electrified environment, that impacts air quality. If we can do that in a way that is more just and more thoughtful about prioritizing the communities that have been held back, I think that the legacy of our work will be transformative. DM: We’re going to have a cohort of fantastic emerging designers, engineers, workforce development specialists, and more. What’s your advice to them? MC: First of all, there’s no room on the sidelines. No one gets to opt out, no one gets to say, “This is not for me.” As a designer, I think you have a fundamental responsibility to demystify the world for everyone who is not a designer—and to do that in a way that’s beautiful and accessible. That responsibility has to be taken seriously. We have to embolden young people and folks who have not necessarily considered themselves a part of climate resistance to understand that they are exactly who we need right now. We are trying to grow the tent in a way that provides more inroads to this work for folks who have either been pushed outside of it or felt excluded, or had not realized how valuable their skill set is. Whatever your skills are, whatever your passions are, whatever you have within your capacity to bring to this fight, we need it. And we need it right now. We’re living in a moment where there are statues to our painful history being torn down in the streets. We’re witnessing a shift in what we always thought was possible. Why should that be limited to just the built environment or inanimate objects like statues? It should be about us, too. Let’s make a shift that discovers a little bit more about what’s possible, and let’s do that in service of each other.

46,Dismantling Exclusionary Zoning: An Interview with Janne Flisrand,https://urbandesignforum.org/dismantling-exclusionary-zoning-an-interview-with-janne-flisrand/,"April 15, 2020","The Urban Design Forum hosted Driving It Home, the fifth event in the Shape Shift series, with two organizers confronting the nation’s housing crisis: Janne Flisrand and Tommy Newman. After the event, our Program Director Guillermo Gomez sat down with Janne Flisrand, co-founder of Neighbors for More Neighbors, a Minneapolis advocacy group that helped the city’s 2040 plan become reality. They discussed at length Minneapolis’ major citywide zoning reform, historic race-based planning policy, and strategies around advocating a fair share of housing. Janne Flisrand, Beatrice Sibblies, and Tommy Newman at the Forum’s Driving It Home event Guillermo Gomez: Janne, we were very grateful to hear about the incredible work you have been doing in Minneapolis around housing advocacy. I want to start off by inviting you to share a little on your background in anthropology. How did that lead you to housing activism in Minneapolis? Janne Flisrand: Anthropology has shaped everything about how I observe the world and understand the world. In particular, it’s foundational for me that the people who experience their day to day lives have the understanding and expertise about what it is that they need. If you want to know what’s going on in somebody’s life or what their challenges are, you ask them. I had that experience prior to becoming interested in housing when I was running a drop-in after-school program in Frogtown, a very low-income neighborhood in St. Paul. The kids were amazing, constantly teaching me things. Then, frequently a kid would stop coming. When I asked where they went, it almost always came back to housing instability. And so I thought: if I care about these kids, if I want these kids to keep teaching me, my work is making sure that they have a stable home and live in a community. I needed to shift focus not on kids but rather on housing issues. I chose to go back to school and do an applied urban anthropology program, taking that experience in learning from those kids and understanding how to make their hopes become real in an urban environment. GG: Through anthropology, you have been able to create a lens and methodology on how you see and practice in the city. As a housing activist in Minneapolis, what have you been able to accomplish since co-founding Neighbors for More Neighbors? JF: Neighbors for More Neighbors was also co-founded by John Edwards and Ryan Johnson in February of 2017. They started with some humor and some jokes on Twitter and people loved it. They realized they had a following that gave them some power. Many specific housing development proposals needed a little nudge to get through the City of Minneapolis, and they asked people to show up, testify, or to send emails to support these projects. And people would do it. Testimony on the Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan The first successes were getting certain projects that had a bunch of housing units – apartments and homes – approved by the City. The next opening came when the City was working on its 20-year comprehensive plan. The process began late 2017 and extended through 2018. Instead of having this piecemeal, one-project-at-a-time success, we could lay the groundwork to change the system and encourage the creation of enough homes so that everybody could have one. I started organizing Neighbors for More Neighbors fans in person, turning that online interest into an advocacy group. We activated hundreds of people to show up and support a really ambitious, comprehensive plan called Minneapolis 2040, which the City Council passed in 2019 and became effective this year. GG: One of the reasons why your advocacy work stood out to us was your name, Neighbors for More Neighbors, and how you all have been able to communicate the benefits of a growing city. Can you share the story behind the name and how it communicates what you are all fighting for? JF: We have a vision for a city in the future – a positive and exciting vision: our city is better when we have more neighbors. John and Ryan, the co-founders, named Neighbors for More Neighbors as kind of a joke. They both have been active on social media – Twitter was their favorite zone – and in local politics. One day, they were sitting around, snarkily poking fun at groups that pop up any time there is a development project. These are groups of people trying to preserve their skyline views or keep their street quiet or take care of the tree in the neighborhood. As a response, [the name] Neighbors for More Neighbors was created as a way to make fun of them – and they realized it was a great name for something more. GG: Where do you feel that positive versus negative messaging helps? JF: Movements grow when you’re painting a picture of something that people want, when you’re able to inspire people with aspirations that connect with their values. Any movement that I’m part of is going to have that kind of positive messaging. Now it’s also true that to motivate people, you need to have villains. But villains don’t have to be a person, right? In our case, the villain is zoning that was explicitly designed to racially and economically segregate our cities. Now it’s also true that to motivate people, you need to have villains. But villains don’t have to be a person, right? In our case, the villain is zoning that was explicitly designed to racially and economically segregate our cities. It was designed to keep people apart. We could maybe point at the villains as the people who wrote that zoning. After the Minnesota Supreme Court made it illegal to enforce racially restrictive covenants, the City of Minneapolis came in and adopted exclusionary zoning a year later. You need to have the bad guy but that bad guy doesn’t have to be a person. And you can’t just rely on the bad guy; you need to have something that will excite people to show up and do something. GG: In recent years, New York City urban development has been extremely polarizing. The media or housing groups want to paint you as either YIMBY (‘yes in my backyard’) if you support growth at all costs, or NIMBY (‘not in my backyard’) if you oppose a specific development. But most of the time, it’s more complex. What were the most successful ways you argued for more density, while building coalitions of supply-side housing advocates and others focused on racial justice? JF: I definitely agree that this is a messy, complex set of issues and complicated set of relationships. You can paint it as two sides, but I would argue that it’s like 20 sides with arguments that aren’t opposite one another, and often are relatively unrelated to one another, although sometimes they are really closely connected. For me, it’s always about being clear about where we want to go and our underlying values. We are focused on a city where everybody can find a place to live in the neighborhood that they choose. And it’s a place that’s stable and affordable for them. That’s our vision. We also know that it’s critical to acknowledge and honor our racial disparities that are a result of explicit race-based policies that created an uneven playing field. And, that after decades and centuries, we’re still living with those results. We also talk about where the actual barriers are. In Minneapolis, the most restrictively zoned places are also the wealthiest places. If we want to end displacement and gentrification, and make sure people can stay in their own communities, we can’t do that by using the same policies that we’ve used for decades. We’ve already asked neighborhoods with the lowest property values and the most historically oppressed populations to accommodate all of the growth in our city. We can’t do that anymore. It’s time for us to change our approach and say everybody has to do their share. Folks have been hosting new neighbors in historically redlined neighborhoods for decades. If they don’t want to do that anymore, that’s fine. We need to ensure that folks who have not been making space in their neighborhoods, make a lot of space right now, because they’ve got decades of catching up to do. It is not whether you want development or you’re opposed to it; it’s about how to create a more just city. GG: In what ways was the welcoming of more density citywide a landmark achievement for Minneapolis in coming to terms with its own racist planning history? What was your process on the ground: how did you speak about racial equity with different communities, homeowners, and elected officials? JF: Around four or five years ago, a group called Mapping Prejudice started engaging residents to read hundreds of thousands of property deeds in Minneapolis, looking for racially restrictive covenants and then mapping them. That was really powerful because we could tell the story of how Minneapolis became racially segregated. Reading those restrictions on your computer screen and realizing that this is in your neighborhood – maybe even your own home – was a really powerful thing. Mapping Prejudice also shared incredible stories in different episodes, where race and homeownership intersected in a way that reinforced the power, privilege, and wealth of white folks in Minneapolis to the detriment of folks who are not white. They told the story in a way that city staff could then easily frame in the housing chapter of the Minneapolis 2040 plan. They were working hard to educate elected leaders. That said, not everybody was going to read the many-thousand-word introduction to the housing chapter on the comprehensive plan. Neighbors for More Neighbors took it one step further by telling that story in blogs, events and meetings. We organized volunteers to bike every single block in the city and look for the folks who are not so psyched about legalizing apartments, who put apocalyptic red signs in their yards that say things like “Developers win, Neighborhoods lose. Don’t bulldoze my home.” We then mapped those properties against redlining maps, then mapped those red sign locations against single-family home values and helped everybody see the correlation. This isn’t just a natural way of being and self-sorting and selecting. This was created by historic policy. If we want a just future where everyone, no matter their race, can choose what neighborhood they live in, we have to tell all those stories in lots of different ways to get there. That was a really key piece of being able to pass this is plan that legalizes apartments in every corner of the city. Redlining maps with properties opposing the 2040 plan GG: In New York City, single-family zoning does exist, but largely in the outer boroughs. One of the challenges around housing development – both market rate and social housing development – has been resistance by homeowners under the guise of historic preservation. Have you navigated similar challenges in Minneapolis between historic preservation and greater density? JF: Yes, we have. Adopting exclusionary zoning to so-called “protect” neighborhoods means homes have to be expensive enough that only wealthy people can live in them. What that did was make the historic fabric of our communities illegal under the zoning code. We often say that we want to re-legalize what used to be legal in our communities. We want to ensure that the things that were legal 100 years ago are legal today, because those are the things that we love in our neighborhood. Those things create character. And right now, by saying it’s illegal to build small or even medium-sized multifamily buildings in these neighborhoods, we can’t even do what we love so much. What I love about my neighborhood are my neighbors. What is the character of a neighborhood? Is it about the buildings or is it about the people? We land on the side of people. Guerilla N4MN sign with local anti-development lawn sign GG: One last question, before part. What’s the next roadblock or hurdle that Neighbors for More Neighbors is up against today? JF: Our biggest challenge is maintaining momentum. It was clear what we were organizing around and what was needed when we were working on Minneapolis 2040. The zoning reforms that are required under Minnesota State Law, because we passed Minneapolis 2040, all have to get implemented. It’s much less clear exactly what we need to do to get all of those adopted. Similarly, because the comprehensive plan has been adopted, how do we highlight which are the most important projects to show up for until they are completely adopted? And how do we work to make sure we’re moving further faster so that we don’t have a growing population that outstrips the new homes in our community, because that’s what pushes people out. That momentum is a little bit harder to maintain because people are really psyched about having passed the plan. They feel like we’ve done what we need to do, and it’s a little bit harder to understand what still remains. GG: Thank you again for sharing your story with us. Often New Yorkers think they have all the answers, but I’ve come to notice over the years that New York is often far behind – and other smaller cities are taking risks and pushing for innovative design, policies, and solutions. JF: It was a pleasure to come. I had a wonderful time. I can’t wait for New York to throw it on a challenge that then Minneapolis has to run to catch up with. GG: You all set the bar high!

47,Cultural Development in Hong Kong: An Interview With Duncan Pescod,https://urbandesignforum.org/cultural-development-in-hong-kong-an-interview-with-duncan-pescod/,"April 14, 2020","The Urban Design Forum hosted its eighth Global Exchange: Private Development, Public Good event about the West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD), an international arts hub rising along 40 hectares of infill land in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. Financed by a $2.8 billion public endowment, the project consists of an expansive public park and 17 planned venues, including a new visual arts museum, an opera house, and an experimental performance venue. Before the off-the-record event, Urban Design Forum Executive Director Daniel McPhee sat down with Duncan Pescod, Chief Executive Officer of WKCD, for a wide-ranging discussion about the project’s financing and design, extensive public engagement efforts, and the future of WKCD in light of recent protest movements in Hong Kong. Daniel McPhee: When fully built out, what will the West Kowloon Cultural District look like? Duncan Pescod: The vision is to become not just a domestic cultural center, but a regional cultural center that serves the Greater Bay Area [of the Pearl River Delta] and beyond in Asia. It’s already starting to have that impact. When we opened Xiqu Center—which is our Chinese opera facility—at the beginning of 2019, many people from the mainland came to see performances because we’re bringing in the best performers from China and beyond. By the time we’ve built out the new cultural facilities, including two museums, the parks, the playgrounds, plus all the commercial hotels and offices, you will have a center in the heart of Hong Kong which provides a whole range of cultural and arts facilities—performances to exhibitions, formal and informal. For example, we’re trying to encourage street performers to produce a lively atmosphere. Something on this scale and ambition will be transformative—it takes time, but it also will have that impact. DM: It’s situated on an interesting site: a major new waterfront precinct adjacent to the new high-speed rail station. What is the history of the project? DP: The site was created on reclaimed land created as part of the “Airport Core Project” for the new Hong Kong airport, which opened in 1998. Around that time, the government questioned what to do with this extra piece of land, before deciding to make it an investment in the future, rather than more offices and housing. At that time, there was a big debate about protecting the harbor—making it less of a functional, working harbor, and more of a recreational harbor. The two things came together and the debate was whether to build something touristic or cultural. If you look at the economic benefit to Hong Kong, we’re investing heavily in the financial sector; we have a strong port sector; and now we can have tourism and creative industries as a third pillar. I was at the Tourism Commission at the time and part of that debate. In a sense, I’ve been involved indirectly and directly since the earliest days. The Art Park at West Kowloon Cultural District DM:The project has changed pretty significantly since its initial conception. Can you talk about how the program has changed in particular? DP: The project initially intended to be commercially-driven, with a single developer given the entire site and required to deliver on cultural and arts facilities. The community didn’t really shine to that at all. They felt that was giving too much influence to the commercial elements. That proposal failed essentially because of community objections. Then, the government went back to the drawing board and decided that they would create the Authority to take the lead and develop the cultural and arts facilities while still involving developers by selling off the commercial elements of the site. DM: On a project of this scale, do you need community consultation from just its neighbors—the people in the surrounding community—or from the city at large? DP: We need both. For example, we have a consultation panel, on which I have local district counselors. But I also have people from the arts community and academics. DM: You mentioned that there at least one major rewriting of the plan. DP: Yes—in the sense that it went in one direction first, and then it changed to another. And then, in addition, the development plan as agreed has been revisited a number of times. One would expect that anyway over the period of ten years since the plan was adopted. DM: But the basic premise that it should be really about culture and recreation has never been challenged? JN: Never challenged. It’s still fundamental. The government took a view, and they stuck to it. It’s not like the U.K. model where every four or five years you change the government and everything changes. So far, fingers crossed, we have a consistency in our approach. Creative industries give you an opportunity to see future employment growth on a scale that many other industries will not. If you look around in China and in Asia, there’s a lot of investment in culture and arts now because people really appreciate it. There are going to be big challenges in terms of employment with increasing use of Artificial Intelligence, robotics, etc. Where are the jobs going to come from? Creative industries give you an opportunity to see future employment growth on a scale that many other industries will not. Even banking! We’ve invested a lot in insurance and banking, and now it’s all going towards Artificial Intelligence. We had have to come up with something new. DM: Even New York’s jobs plan focuses largely on the creative industries. Can we talk about the financing of the project? I know that originally in the early 2000s it was supposed to be delivered largely by private financing and partners with this commercial mix. Since then, the public sector has taken on a large share of the financing. DP: Yeah, as I said before, the original plan was that it would be a single developer who would build everything and take the profit out when he could. That was absolutely rejected because the community didn’t like it. So that died very quickly. The government then came up with the idea of injecting the value of the land capitalized, which would then deliver the cultural elements of the project. So they created the Authority and the government injected 21.6 billion Hong Kong dollars into the project. The problem was they didn’t know what the development plan would be. They didn’t know the timeframe. They assumed everything would essentially be built as one. They had assumptions on things like return-on-investment, costs, inflation, etc. Duncan presenting to the Urban Design Forum Between 2008 when the Authority was created and 2011 when the development plan was finally set, two key things happened. First, we had the Financial Crisis, so a lot of the financial calculations just went under. And then secondly, they decided on the Foster + Partners plan with this enormously expensive basement component, which had not been funded. The government then decided to be pragmatic, not requiring us to build everything at once. They also decided that government always provides the public infrastructure, like roads and sewers, so they agreed to fund the core and shell of the basement. Then the big question emerged: what do we do to fund the rest of the cultural and arts facilities? We’re going to have to do capital campaigns and all of those things that are familiar to you in the United States. Herzog & de Meuron’s design for the M+ Museum DM: As we’re exploring how to do a waterfront project like this in New York, we’ll have to think about a couple of things. One is, how would we structure an authority? Two is, how can we finance this and what share has to be private? Do you think Hong Kong’s Build-Operate-Transfer model one that’s worth exporting? DP: We’re trying it now. And it’s working on our first commercial project—we’ve just done an expression of interest. And we’ll probably put the tender out next month. It’s a $10 billion dollar plus project from our estimation. I think it is a viable proposition insofar as the developers wouldn’t have come on board if they didn’t think they’d make a profit out of it. In this particular one, we’ve packaged the exhibition center with a hotel in an office complex to make it viable. Most of the other sites will be for a plot for office development, or a hotel as an individual project. The tender process is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2020. Targeted project completion is 2025/2026. Ask me in six months how it turns out. DM: And how would you advise us on the kind of mix that you’ve been able to achieve: was it the right mix of culture and commercial? DP: Honestly, it’s evolving. We’re focused primarily on the cultural and arts delivery first. Honestly, that’s not the best way to do it. You have to do both in parallel. But because that is the priority given to us by the government, we have to do it this way. At least we’ll have a sort of a nucleus in the district. There are many different elements that you need to think about. For example, one of the key elements is to what extent do you need the ‘creatives’ in the district. We’re not like Barcelona, where you’re using culture to regenerate an existing district. We don’t have anything. We are trying to bring in all of the disparate elements, not just the performers who are offering a finished product, but the artists that are creating that product. We’re looking at hosting resident companies. We’re looking at building artist residencies, so people can live and create within the district. We’re also looking at developing education facilities. We’re looking at not just being a venue for hire. It’s a tenuous mix of different elements that you’re trying to cram together to create the whole, and it’s proving more difficult in some ways than people expected because it is artificial. It takes time to build momentum. You’ve got to keep pushing, because people in the artistic sector don’t really understand what we’re trying to do. At the same time, we’re trying to push something that no one else is doing. The recently completed Xiqu Centre for traditional Chinese opera DM: So, can you talk a little bit about the cultural mix? Domestic vs. regional vs. international—what was the most important to prioritize? DP: You’ve got to try and balance the two. To be honest with you, though we have strong domestic artistic qualities, they’re not very well known beyond Hong Kong. And to a certain extent that’s limited their ability to develop. So, we’ve been working with local artists to take them abroad. Yet we are always leading with the understanding that this is a Hong Kong project. How does it benefit either the audience, or performers, or future trainees? DM: Hong Kong is a city that’s grappling with this tension in more ways than just on the West Kowloon site. How has Hong Kong’s recent political movement shaped the way that you are thinking about the future of the cultural district? DP: Honestly, it’s reinforcing the need. The one thing that is underpinning a lot of the debate in the community, leave aside the violence, is this notion of protecting fundamental freedoms: freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom from trouble and all of that. What do we represent if not that? Our internal conversations consider: how do we prepare ourselves such that when things returned to a “new normal,” we’re ready to really contribute to that new normality? We are actively trying to keep things as steady as we can. We’re running programs even though there’s chaos in the streets! The philosophy we have the show must go on. We’ve got to provide an alternative to people if they’re scared of going out on the streets. People come to us and it should be safe. We had to adapt. We basically just do matinee performances now. We don’t want people to be trying to get home and have their transport disrupted. And we’re continuing to build and explore development opportunities. Duncan Pescod in conversation with Luke Fox (KPF) and Vincent Chang (Grimshaw) This is not the best time to put out a major development package—the private sector is very constrained by the situtation. But we feel it’s important to do. If we delay this project, then it’ll be too late when it’s needed. There is a debate surrounding what exactly will be the outcome. I don’t have a crystal ball. But the one thing I think is true is that the artistic community has been at the forefront of a lot that’s been going on in Hong Kong. We give can give them a space other than the streets to explore. We don’t have to be subject to the political implications. We can look at it purely through an artistic lens. DM: It does seem like the true success of the project is going to be seen in the next few years when the “new normal” is being expressed and challenged and rearticulated. DP: Artists will be at the forefront of whatever it is. They are generally ahead of the rest of the community in how to express expressing themselves. If we can give them a decent opportunity to express themselves, that’s going to be really cool for for Hong Kong. It will be a place where the debate can be taking place in a safe fashion. It doesn’t have to be out on the streets against the police—it can be done in a more civil environment, for want of a better description. Art allows for that.

48,Wellness Through Urbanism: An Interview with James Nozar on Tampa’s Water Street,https://urbandesignforum.org/wellness-through-urbanism-an-interview-with-james-nozar-on-tampas-water-street/,"April 10, 2020","The Urban Design Forum hosted its seventh Global Exchange: Private Development, Public Good event about the mixed-use Water Street development in Tampa, Florida. Doubling the size of Tampa’s downtown, Water Street reenvisions fifty-three acres of the city’s underutilized waterfront as the world’s first WELL-certified neighborhood. Designed to promote physical and mental health, the new neighborhood includes amenities like advanced recycling systems, outdoor physical activity programming, and a community wellness center. Before the off-the-record event, Urban Design Forum Executive Director Daniel McPhee sat down with James Nozar, CEO of Strategic Property Partners, to discuss how he has worked collaboratively with Mayor Jane Castor to leverage Water Street’s unique single investment structure to streamline design and development and build a new ground-up urban hub for Tampa. Daniel McPhee: How did the idea for Water Street Tampa first emerge? James Nozar: It first emerged eight or nine years ago with Jeff Vinik, one of the owners of our firm. He bought the Tampa Bay Lightning NHL team in Tampa. He saw an opportunity in the team and an opportunity in the market. He realized that to be a successful sports owner you really need to be all in on the market that you’re in. We were all coming out of the recession, and some parcels around the arena in downtown Tampa became available. Before he knew it, he had amassed almost 50 acres of contiguous land around the arena. Jeff began conducting extensive research to conceptualize the full potential for this well-located urban site on the waterfront. He knew he needed the right partner to realize that vision and so so he partnered with Cascade Investment, LLC. Both Jeff Vinik and Cascade Investment shared a long-term focus on this particular investment. They realized this long-term perspective would be necessary to truly realize a transformational opportunity in Tampa, thus a large commitment and forming a team to ensure it was done right. This is a change to the more common real estate development and investment mentality to design, entitle, develop, stabilize, then sell. We’re thinking as much about what the neighborhood and our buildings look and feel like in 15 to 20 years, as we are about them at delivery. DM: Tell me a bit about how you work with the Tampa City government. How have you worked with local officials to strengthen the project? JN: Tampa Bay is a large market, with 3.1 million people and growing rapidly, but it still has a small-town feeling.. We’re fortunate to be working closely with the Mayor and our other partners at the City on a daily basis – on things ranging from public infrastructure, to project-level entitlements, to advising on potential new policies around transportation and housing affordability. They are true collaborators and we all share the same goals around improving the lives of the citizens in our community to create a better quality of life, and hence value, for everyone. We are also dealing with Hillsborough County, that Tampa sits within, and with the state quite a bit. And, of course, we’re actively involved with the Tampa Bay Economic Development Council, the Tampa Bay Chamber, and a host of other local community and civic organizations. The Mayor, the economic development team within the City, and the City Planning team have all been intimately involved. We’ve been an active part of dozens and dozens of meetings over the years where the City and community have just thrown out ideas. It’s an iterative process where we’ve fed off of each other, thinking about what the City’s goals are for the urban core and surrounding neighborhoods and communitiesWe’re one of many vested stakeholders who have an active seat at that table and it is exciting to be a part of that collaborative process. James Nozar speaking at the Harvard Club DM: What do you think motivates the City the most? Is it really about reconnecting the downtown? Is it about building a new job center, or creating a new entertainment district? JN: Like us at SPP, I think they’re looking to shape the inevitable growth of Tampa sustainably. The City and larger region has definitely had its ups and downs over the years, but over the last 10 years the economy has significantly matured and diversified. There’s a lot of investment coming into the market and the City has smartly been looking at how to best grow and sustain that. Particularly over the last couple of decades, the City has also invested heavily in the downtown core and waterfront, including anchors like the Tampa Riverwalk, which is a two-and-a-half mile trail on the Waterfront, to Curtis Hickson Park, to the Convention Center, to Amalie Arena, to the History Center, to the Florida Aquarium. There’s now a very nice ‘necklace’ of activity that’s proven to be very popular to residents and visitors alike, which has spurred private investments in the surrounding areas. Until recently, a lot of public investments have been made in Tampa’s downtown, but private investment lagged. With the City’s support in helping us create new infrastructure and a connected public realm, we’ve been able to create a market-driven mix of building uses along new tree-lined streets with active ground-floor uses in a previously blighted area of the City’s urban core. This is creating new housing, new office space housing new jobs, places to be entertained and recreate, and an amenity base for the existing surrounding workers and residents. We’ve been able to partner our resources with their goals and vision to make all of this a reality. DM: What do Tampanians think about the project? JN: We’ve had very strong support from the broader community over the years. People are excited to see progress in an area that was largely forgotten over the years, and that nobody is being displaced in the process. It does helps that it’s a very transformative and visible project, currently with about a dozen cranes dotting the skyline. We also have this wonderful existing anchor—Amalie Arena—that in addition to housing the Tampa Bay Lightning NHL team, is one of the busiest concert venues in the country. The Lightning are incredibly popular locally and are seen as a broader anchor for the community, that we’re fortunate to be connected to. So, there are already a lot of people coming in and out of the neighborhood quite often, who are able to see the progress and feel like part of the transformation of their City. Tampanians are watching this in real time and the excitement is palpable. James Nozar with the development and design team walking on Water Street before construction DM: I imagine there was a lot of community consultation around the project at a city-wide level. Were there certain things that you changed because of that consultation? JN: Yeah, over the years we have had several hundred community meetings as part of the project. We’re also at the table during other community and civic association meetings – just learning and listening. Naturally, some people question the scale and need for so much new space at one time and have concerns about the neighborhood ‘pricing out’ many in the broader community. We are building quite a lot of new retail and office space in downtown Tampa, which hasn’t seen a lot of new commercial uses built over the past 25 years. But, with all the surrounding and new residences and focus on high-quality new buildings, we’re seeing quite a lot of interest from local and national tenants. We’re ahead of where we thought we’d be at this time. We’re also trying to be very thoughtful about the mix and type of new residential, office and retail space we’re creating – making more flexible and efficient spaces for a diverse audience. In response to dialogue about the lack of gathering places in Tampa, last year, we also opened Sparkman Wharf, which has been an incredibly popular 1-acre open-air community gathering place along the waterfront that’s open to all. It includes a beer garden and ten shipping containers housing various food options, an outdoor bandshell and large-screen video wall. We have programmed everything from mommy yoga, to athletic competitions, to movie nights and live music. So, I think people are seeing that the opportunity to create something really special, even at this scale, is very possible DM: This project is going to earn the first WELL Community Standards Certification. Why did you decide to go all in on wellness? JN: For us, a focus on wellness is really just about being responsible long-term owners of real estate. From the outset, we planned on creating comfortable outdoor spaces, walkable blocks, open air spaces, diverse areas for recreation, and designing with wellness in mind. Our vision naturally aligned with the WELL designation. For us, a focus on wellness is really just about being responsible long-term owners of real estate. Our owners, Jeff Vinik and Cascade Investment, LLC are invested quite heavily in wellness. Their interest allowed us to pilot a lot of these things. We were very active in the formulation of what became the WELL Community Standard —helping pilot tests to figure out how to make the standard work in a practical sense. We are also pursuing WELL certification on a number of the new buildings underway, and LEED certifications at the building and neighborhood-level. Again, the reason is because we believe there is great alignment in the objectives and criteria of these certifications with our long-term vision for the neighborhood and those who will live, work and visit here daily. DM: Beyond its marketing value, wellness is something that I think everyone can agree on. How did it translate to the design, or push you further than you normally would have gone? JN: It made us consider every single detail, especially on the programming side — the use of the spaces and offering a variety of spaces for the community. We’re opening a Wellness Center with features like a demonstration kitchen that will be programmed with regular chef-led classes that will provide education on healthy cooking options that will be open for anyone to use, as well as having filtered water bottle refilling stations and regular farmer’s markets. . Wellness also informed the mix of retailers we are bringing to Water Street Tampa. It’s incredibly diverse, but also neighborhood-driven. Think about the programming and activation I mentioned —like mommy yoga at Sparkman Wharf. That kind of programming has opened up the project to audiences who may not have otherwise interacted with it. Patrice Derrington, Mayor Jane Castor, and Elizabeth Randall DM: It seems like a natural fit for Florida where people are looking to live well. Beyond the wellness focus, in your materials, you have promoted smart city technologies and developments that anticipate technology. With projects of this timeline, it’s hard to even imagine what 10 years from now will look like. How did you forecast what technologies are going to be useful, and, and how did that shape the design? JN: It’s kind of impossible! 10 years ago, the iPhone had just been created. And everybody was designing docking stations in their apartments to listen to their music. For us, it’s more about the backbone. We’ve had the benefit of recreating the entire road network through downtown Tampa and putting in the utilities and all new infrastructure. We put in miles of conduit and miles of fiber, making the entire district very well-connected below the ground. All the buildings will speak to each other, from building management systems to security and access control. You’ve seen this done in other masterplans —Hudson Yards has done quite a bit. We’re trying to be very careful in order to understand the privacy concerns. It’s not our intent to get in and control someone’s day-to-day. Instead we think about things like mobility: How do you get here and around here? How does that tie into parking structures or payments? What about programming and activation? That’s how we’re looking at it—to reduce friction in the day-to-day life of people living, working and interacting with the district. Rendering of the future 100 Block of Water Street DM: It is amazing to see the emerging tension between privacy concerns and the flexibility that technology can allow. I’m sure that you are wrestling with it in some way. JN: We aren’t thinking of Water Street Tampa as a “smart city” because our intent is not to be farming data. We are leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and the everyday experience. We think it would be irresponsible for us to not take advantage of the great synergies we can have and these connectivity tools when we are building from scratch. DM: I know you are also kind of constrained by the expressway. How are you envisioning transportation to and within the area? JN: It is a natural barrier. Because it’s elevated, there are ways to create some porosity between it and downtown. We own land on both sides of it, so creating that linkage between the traditional downtown and the neighborhoods around is important to us. We recently bought a flour mill on the north end of our property that had been in operations since the 1930s, and they’re relocating further south along the port. With that flour mill came rail lines that connect to all the places that you would want rail to connect to in Tampa—the airport, downtown, up to the University of South Florida. The rights-of-way are all there. Also, we’re spending quite a bit of time creating East-West and North-South linkages for a pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular street network. DM: Yeah, it’s something that New York is wrestling with: how to connect neighborhoods that are really divided by elevated infrastructure like expressways or old subway lines. I want to talk a little about the financing, because it’s super interesting. It’s so rare to have a single financier leading this kind of major urban development. What kind of flexibility does that give you? JN: We’re very fortunate to have great capital partners and owners. They own the company, as well as all the real estate. So you eliminate traditional challenges between fiduciary duties that you would otherwise have—such as when you have different capitalization on different assets within the project. We’re able to look at everything with one bottom line across the company’s entire portfolio, which allows us to think creatively about anchors and retail. Retail amounts to 6% of our overall floor area, but it’s driving a lot of our value across the entire neighborhood. Being able to decide what is the right type of retail or merchandising mix for the long-term success of the overall project—versus being focused on a certain credit tenant, or rent on day one—is one example of the flexibility. The Mariott Water Street under construction Overall, the financing situation allows us to do what we think is right for the long term. To think about the long-term operations of the project, value, growth, and doing something the right way—it’s changed the entire approach, and it’s even led to the type of people we have on our team. DM: I also can’t help but notice that you’ve recruited New York and Boston firms to do the work. How does architectural excellence factor into your plan? JN: When we came down to Tampa, we were looking for an overall vision for Water Street. It came down to things like: We live in a city that has a wonderful climate with 307 days of sun every single year, people lead a very active indoor-outdoor lifestyle, and we live in a very green atmosphere. People don’t talk about Tampa as having Live Oak trees and Spanish Moss, but we do! And that really led us to a team of architects and collaborators – locally and abroad – that understood depth and context and integration of greenery into their buildings. The firms that we’re working with—like COOKFOX, Elkus Manfredi, Reed Hilderbrand, Nelson Byrd Woltz, KPF, Morris Adjmi, Gensler—all spoke that language. DM: Okay, one last question: New York City is thinking seriously about how to change up the way it does waterfront planning. I’m curious: what would you advise New York City to think about? JN: I’d suggest considering how waterfront development can better open up to the surrounding neighborhoods. How can the buildings be designed to interact with the wider community, rather than create privatized little fiefdoms? Developers can tend to think very insularly about their specific projects, which can lead to disjointed and uncoordinated buildings and neighborhoods. The City can take a strong role in guiding planning for the greater good of the community it serves. For more information about Water Street, please visit their site.

49,New Flood Resilient Neighborhoods: An Interview with Waterfront Toronto’s Chris Glaisek,https://urbandesignforum.org/new-flood-resilient-neighborhoods-an-interview-with-waterfront-torontos-chris-glaisek/,"March 30, 2020","The Urban Design Forum hosted its sixth Global Exchange: Private Development, Public Good event with Waterfront Toronto’s Chief Planning and Design Officer Chris Glaisek. Chris oversees the broad effort to redevelop over 2,000 acres of industrial land into mixed-use, flood-resilient neighborhoods. Before the off-the-record event, Urban Design Forum Executive Director Daniel McPhee sat down with Chris to discuss how Waterfront Toronto’s lengthy public engagement process resulted in detailed block plans specifying architectural character and use, as well as major investments in the public realm. Daniel McPhee: Both Toronto and New York City have been undergoing major waterfront transformations. Here, we have a ten-year waterfront plan being developed by the Department of City Planning and we’re exploring a major new infill project similar to Battery Park City on the East River. Like Toronto, we also have something similar to your “tri-governmental problem,” but no agency like Waterfront Toronto that brings together all three levels of government, which seems to work for you fairly well. Chris Glaisek: It’s a double-edged sword because you’re forced to comply with three sets of rules and regulations and policies, as opposed to just one, which can make things more complicated. But it also creates access to all levels of government in a way that we would not have otherwise. All three levels have a stake in some piece of the waterfront. We have a port authority, which is federal; land that’s owned by the city—plus the city serves as land-use regulator; and the Province as the environmental regulator. Where it gets more difficult is that no government feels like they have unilateral control over us the way they would own one of their own agencies, so sometimes there’s a nervousness. Chris Glaisek presenting to the Urban Design Forum We’re very much about compromise in Canada, more so than in the U.S. These things take time when you have to negotiate every single thing to the final detail. But that is how Canadians approach things: we don’t go to war, we go to meetings! DM: So, how did Toronto pull you away from New York City? CG: The main thing that hooked me was the scale: Waterfront Toronto’s legislative mandate is about 2,000 acres of downtown waterfront. There isn’t another city in North America that is trying to think and act on that scale. There may be some that are doing bigger things now, but this was 15 years ago. Plus, they had a fresh pot of $1.5 billion to do public infrastructure improvements. Part of the the secret sauce of the whole Waterfront Toronto organization is the way the financing was evenly split—$500 million from the City, the Province, and Ottawa. They were all in it together. I was drawn by a combination of the money, the scope, and then the company’s mandate to engage in visionary city building, not just real estate development. There had been a few public corporations before us that were supposed to revitalize the waterfront who were broadly perceived as having messed it up, misused money, or focused on private development but never came through with promised public realm improvements. Consequently, there was a lot of scrutiny and attention, and therefore a lot of emphasis in our mission statement on design excellence, quality-of-place, sustainability, and public benefit. Aerial View of West Don Lands DM: So, after 15 years of working there, you’ve seen the full lifecycle of some of these projects. We invited you to talk about the West Don Lands development because it is nearing completion. The project mixes affordable housing, resilient infrastructure, and adaptive reuse of industrial heritage—these are all important priorities for us as well. How did the West Don Lands plan come to be in the first place? CG: About 30 years ago, the City identified it as a declining industrial area and bought up a lot of the land with the idea of doing a major redevelopment project. The City’s done a lot of revitalization projects on the East Side—efforts to clear out industrial or underperforming parts of the city and do new comprehensive plans. The City had the same vision for the West Don Lands, but the problem was flood protection. The whole area is in the flood zone of the Don River. Between having to pay for flood protection and remediate all the soil, the cost of the project was just so high that the City couldn’t figure out how to develop it. They reached a point where they decided to dispose of it and the Province bought it from them. Naturally, the Province had all the same problems that the City had in making redevelopment work. The Province’s real estate company made some unpopular proposals, in part because they had investors pitch ideas that they thought might be the silver bullet for this problem area. One of them was a horse race track! This is right downtown around small residential neighborhoods. The neighborhood organized a massive opposition campaign, and more or less grounded the Province to a halt. So, when Waterfront Toronto came in, we took on the West Don Lands as one of our priority areas because it had been subject to multiple failed planning attempts. We came up with a proposal scheme centered around flood protection. DM: Something that’s notable about that Master Plan are the detailed block plans—how much you can build, the massing, the land use, the street improvements. It is a notable departure from what we do in New York, which follows a developer-driven model. What were the benefits of a more prescriptive approach? CG: The community had become very sensitized to development plans and wanted certainty around what would happen. Their support was essential to getting any redevelopment plans approved by Council. At the same time, because of contaminated soil, the cost of the flood protection, and the kind of untested nature of the neighborhood, no one saw a private funding model that could have worked. Many residents asked, “Why are you building the parks there?” But the developers sold the units faster and hit all their prices! The parks and the great public realm enhanced their returns. DM: Right. The initial $1.5 billion was really just meant as the seed fund. And as you created value, you were able to sell the land, and then accrue even more investment. CG: That was the idea, yet there has been some lack of clarity around land control. The governments started feeling the land proceeds should help pay back their investment. Our initial model had been to be self-funding and self-sustaining, but without getting the land proceeds back, we couldn’t really do that. This is a debate that we still have. DM: And that kind of reinvestment was supposed to make possible a lot of the public benefits: streetscape improvements, transit improvements… CG: Yeah—we were supposed to deliver on all those public promises in more and more areas. Because it was all pretty big and industrial, and there wasn’t a whole lot there, there was a belief that if we made some public investments up front, it would make it more attractive to come down to the waterfront. We had this whole slogan called ‘leading with landscaping,’ because we built new parks and new streets in the middle of nowhere. And there were people who thought that was a strange thing to do, you know. Many residents asked, “Why are you building the parks there?” But the developers sold the units faster and hit all their prices! The parks and the great public realm enhanced their returns. This was the whole plan and it worked. Looking West from Corktown Common DM:It’s such a departure from what we do in New York, which is to give the developer the opportunity to determine land use and urban design, provided they go through a public review process. CG: Well that’s how we often would do it in Toronto, too. We didn’t do it like that in this case, because of the whole political legacy of the community not trusting people to deliver a responsible plan. Instead, we delivered a responsible prescriptive plan with community input. In fact, we are the biggest community consultation firm in Toronto. We conduct hundreds of public consultations. We engage the community right from the beginning so the plan is supported by the community–and you know that doesn’t happen very often when there’s a redevelopment plan. DM: Public consultations can make or break all projects at this scale. I’m curious: how did you lead community consultations? Did they differentiate from traditional town hall meetings? Was it a local neighborhood or broader city-wide discussion of the future of the site? CG: It was mostly local. We tried to broaden it but it was hard to get people interested in the waterfront who weren’t near it. So the engagement kept gravitating back towards immediate neighborhood groups, and some civic organizations. We’ve never been able to turn it into a citywide conversation about the waterfront. What was different was we were really listening. We were asking community members to help us come up with the plans, rather than presenting and then defending the plans. There are two kinds of approaches to public engagement and ours is focused on co-creation, rather than compliance. There’s compliance engagement, where the statute says you have to hold a public meeting, so you go and you hold your public meeting, you show what you want to show, people say whatever they say, and then you go on your merry way. And maybe you write a report, explaining why you couldn’t do any of the things that community asked you to do. We haven’t behaved that way at all and it does add time to the process. We’ll have a meeting, we’ll get 100 comments, and we’ll change the plan! We’ll redesign things to accommodate input. It sounds really elemental and simple, but it just is not what people were expecting. So we got a loyal following of people who felt real value in participating because they started to see themselves reflected back in the plans. Residents enjoying Corktown Common DM: Even when we say that we’re co-creating, oftentimes we are just defending something. Would you bring the community members specific questions or share the things you are investigating so that they could take a closer look and then offer back solutions? CG: Yes, we actually have a two-tier system where we do stakeholder meetings and then public meetings. The stakeholder meetings are a more focused group, generally of people who each represent a broader organization. All the home-owners associations and condo boards of any buildings that were within the area could designate a representative. They became advisors to us, and we would bounce everything off of them before we went to the public so that they could flag for us: “the public’s not going to like that”, or “the public’s going to want to see more of this.” That’s where the trust was built. The big 200 person public meeting isn’t where you do that. And then, we would do one-on-one meetings with impacted landowners: anybody who owned a property and wanted to talk to us. Now, I’m not talking about single-family houses. Most of our landowner meetings are with land owners who owned big parcels that had been assembled for industrial use. They were bigger, more influential landowners. Chris Glaisek in conversation with Margaret Newman DM: In projects that last fifteen years or twenty years, you may realize the residents are the ones who last the whole time, as opposed to the political constituencies—city, state, federal governments—that are changing every two or four years. CG: I can’t remember how many administrations we’ve been through, but I think it’s like 25. And more than that in the number of ministers. Even between election cycles we’ll hear, “you’re reporting to the environment minister now,” or “now to infrastructure,” and then we get switched some more. Each time we have to go through a whole education process all over again. There’s a lot of time and energy spent just involved in the kind of government relations aspect of it.

51,Caring for Our City,https://urbandesignforum.org/caring-for-our-city/,"July 11, 2019","By Daniel McPhee Rather than cut ribbons, New York City’s next mayor should take on the radical work of rebuilding our essential infrastructure. The most daunting challenge facing our city today is not what to build, but what to restore. Our subway system is in crisis, our public housing is collapsing, and our major roadways are crumbling. We have let decades of disinvestment and unaccountable leadership threaten the very systems that keep New York City humming. And worse, our terrible track record on infrastructure has undermined the public’s confidence and kept the City from bravely building open space, public transit, and social housing for the next generation of New Yorkers. We need to correct our short-sightedness and fix our city’s broken culture of maintenance. The institutions that manage our public realm are too narrow, too unequal, and too undemocratic. If we aspire to serve not only the affluent, but the average New Yorker, it will require true political leadership, reform of our city stewards, compassionate design and engineering, and a voter base unwilling to accept the status quo. Reform our Stewards It’s hard to believe that four decades later the culture of New York City’s 1970s fiscal crisis is still sown into the landscape of the city. Civic heroes created conservancies and business improvement districts to rescue Central Park and Grand Central Terminal through private and corporate philanthropy. Their runaway success rippled to open spaces and commercial corridors across Manhattan and wealthy corners of Brooklyn and Queens. At last count, the City boasted 76 business improvement districts and dozens of parks conservancies and preservation groups. These institutions–which often just focus on a single park, landmark, or commercial strip–miss the forest for the trees. The remainder of the city–everyday streetscapes, parks, storefronts, and landmarks–fall victim to underinvestment and lack of stewardship. (Not to mention that many of these institutions are governed by impacted businesses and funded by private philanthropy, rather than neighboring residents.) Philanthropy can still support the public realm, but with our city in a new golden age, it’s time to reform our nonprofit stewards. Stewards: let’s take a more regional view. Why shouldn’t conservancies support parks across an entire borough? Why not recharter business improvement districts to cover an entire community board? Couldn’t we bank development rights to support landmarks across the five boroughs? Use the power of philanthropy to serve not only the core, but the periphery too. Design for the Disenfranchised There will be countless opportunities to rethink our failing, midcentury public works in the near term. Look no further than our major thoroughfares and public housing. Some might be patched up incrementally, but we have reached a point at which deferred maintenance threatens the health and safety of many others. We have an opportunity not just to rebuild better, with durable materials or resilient approaches, but to reconsider the communities that our infrastructure serves. Could we revamp our roadways not just for out-of-town traffic, but to accommodate a wide variety of bicycles, wheelchairs, scooters, paws and feet? Could we tear down elevated infrastructure and reunify once-divided communities? Could we ensure all subway station improvements also introduce new elevators to improve accessibility? Could we rebuild our public housing with direct input from residents, informing our approaches to new unit layouts, circulation, and shared spaces? Designers & engineers: consider how heroic infrastructure could serve the needs of common New Yorkers. And not just tomorrow, but in a century, too! Design for and with communities that have been historically abandoned, divided, or displaced by major urban projects. Reclaim the Public Realm To address other thorny issues – where overlapping political jurisdictions and empty budgets might preclude public action – city agencies are allowing new towers to fix old problems. A rundown subway station finds reinvestment through a skyscraper overhead, or air rights are invented to build and maintain an adjacent park. Yet our edifice complex has adverse consequences. We are encouraging short-term solutions without confronting the root causes of our problems – all the while, adding new density and further burdening our public realm. Will cleaning up subway entrances and mezzanines do anything to address much-needed signaling upgrades? Are we unlocking new residential development while contributing little to desperate public housing? And will these new open spaces, developed and maintained by private actors, welcome as diverse an audience as our legacy public parks? City planners and elected officials: reclaim the role that government can play in managing the public realm. Treat public housing, parks and transit like the critical infrastructure they are, and champion reform and reconstruction. Develop project budgets that can be creatively funded and timelines that are realistic. End the deferred maintenance mindset and argue for new operating, rather than capital dollars. You don’t even have to do it alone! Tap into local pride and allow communities to restore a beloved landmark or subway station. Institute participatory budgeting and encourage residents to focus on less sexy but still vital community needs. When you can prove that you can sustain the public works we rely on, the voters of New York will trust you to build boldly once again. Elect Pothole Politicians A new culture of care will require not just the city’s political class, design leadership, and public-private partnerships to work together. The city’s voters also need to demand better. To members of the public: don’t let another generation of elected officials duck our maintenance crises. Start electing visionary pothole politicians. Demand that city agencies reclaim their role in managing the public realm. And mobilize your neighbors to take action when your open spaces, transit options, and public housing are at risk. Let’s get to work. – Daniel McPhee is Executive Director of the Urban Design Forum, an independent membership organization that convenes leaders in urban planning, design and development to debate the defining issues facing New York City and our urbanizing world. He works with the Board of Directors to present programming on community development, historic preservation, housing, open space, resiliency, and transportation. In recent years, he has led inquiries into the advent of new mobility technologies in New York City, the redevelopment of American public housing, and the mass urbanization of China.

52,Disinvestment by Design,https://urbandesignforum.org/disinvestment-by-design/,"July 11, 2019","By Braden Crooks and April De Simone In the wake of the Great Depression, the Federal Government rolled out the New Deal and created the American middle class as we know it. The only catch? This opportunity would be deliberately reserved for White families. Through various channels, Jim Crow racism would be designed into new systems that would build wealth and bolster the livelihoods of many Americans. None of these racist systems was more powerful or consequential than Redlining. It is difficult to understate the impact of Redlining, along with the mentality and practices behind it, on the American geography. Redlining was a process used to map every city in America in the 1930s. Two hundred and thirty-nine maps laid out which areas should receive investment and which areas, colored in red, were too “hazardous” to receive federally backed home loans. While this granted some places and people access to the new American Dream of home ownership, other areas were slated for disinvestment—exacerbated as the practice of Redlining spread from home loans to business loans, insurance, and even bank branch locations. These places became cut off. But why zone an area Red, and doom it to decline? The maps tell us. In the area descriptions for many red zones is the language, “Hazardous Influences: Negro Infiltration.” The descriptor “hazardous populations and social groups” was especially targeted toward Black people, but also included Hispanic, Asian, and Jewish communities, as well as “Foreign Born Elements” such as Italian and Polish immigrants. The maps tracked the “infiltration” and “invasion” of certain people. After World War II, some of these populations assimilated to become White, but the language in these documents and the targeting of immigrants and people of color is all too familiar in 2019. As time went on, many neighborhoods in American cities declined and increasingly became zones of concentrated poverty and dilapidated infrastructure. Meanwhile, in areas deemed suitable for loans, wealth flourished. But what makes an area “green” on the map and therefore low risk and ripe for investment? These areas had “restrictions on hazardous infiltration,” meaning they had racial covenants declaring the area Whites only. The Federal Government deemed this a good thing because it “preserves the value of the neighborhood.” Though some areas in cities were zoned green, many were suburban places and new developments that could wall themselves off to just Whites. What this means is, over time, the practice of Redlining would produce the American structural geography that we are so familiar with across most cities: concentrated areas of poverty in cities with mostly people of color, and much wealthier, Whiter suburbs surrounding them. And so Redlining took us from the explicit racism of the Jim Crow era into the structural racism of today, which is designed into the very landscape of the Nation. As suburbs grew, highways were built through urban neighborhoods to serve the residents of these suburbs. While the middle class passed on wealth gained through home ownership, other neighborhoods grappled with blight, abandonment, and fires. Schools were defunded, infrastructure left to rot, unemployment skyrocketed, and policies like Broken Windows Policing were enforced to deal with the fallout, leading to Mass Incarceration. To understand the toll of this deliberate disinvestment, we need look no further than the neighborhood our co-author, April, experienced growing up. The Tremont section of the Bronx knows this story intimately. Redlining, the Cross Bronx Expressway, the “planned shrinkage” and destruction of the Third Avenue subway line, and terrible fires all ravaged the neighborhood. The heroin epidemic, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, crack and epidemic violence followed. Redlining not only dramatically altered the social infrastructure of daily life—in many places it nearly obliterated it. When April’s mother bought a home in Tremont she was working two jobs and believed she had bought into the American dream. She was going to build a life for her family, but in the absence of typical home mortgages was forced to purchase an exploitative “contract buy,” in which a single late payment can nullify any equity while inflating interest rates—often bankrupting families. The block eventually burned, leaving their home—now worthless and badly damaged—the only one standing. Heroin, violence, and mental illness were all around them. How does a family survive such an experience? How do we reconcile this history with the ideals of our Democracy? The trauma is still fresh and reverberates across society. Meanwhile, in many once-Redlined neighborhoods, gentrification is causing new waves of displacement and disruption to that same social infrastructure. Infrastructure is a tool, and so is disinvestment. We must recognize that disinvestment has often been deployed by design—to harm, disenfranchise, and segregate. These design decisions remain baked into the landscape. It is the structural geography of America. Designed disinvestment guides this geography and then this disruption manifests in the social infrastructure that keeps society from falling apart. To Undesign Redlining, we must heal both people and places. This healing is urgent work that goes well beyond popular symptomatic responses. By ameliorating the effects of deeper systems, we are often simply maintaining those systems. A regenerative approach that goes beyond maintenance is needed. How do we bring investment back into a Redlined community in ways that begin to heal the wealth destruction left in its wake? Private investment follows public investment, and if a community has no way to capture that wealth and feed it back into the neighborhood from the ground up, planned improvements to neighborhoods will be met with fear of gentrification. This is why co-ownership models like Community Land Trusts (CLTs), cooperatives, social enterprises, commons, and crowd equity have increased in popularity. As connective infrastructure, these can maintain a sort of community-based, regenerative safety net. How do we develop communities from the ground up, with the participation of everyone? As it stands, communities often feel the only way to have agency in their own development is through opposition. We need human-centered design capacities and the social infrastructure for a process of ground-up development that can unleash their creativity. This is why democratic systems of design and local decision making are growing across the country: accessible in on-the-ground community hubs, through technology and public process. Communities want to drive their own maintenance, regeneration, and evolution. How do we center shared values and rights in our collective intentionality and decision making? The road to hell is paved with good intentions that lack a clear understanding of the problems they are trying to solve and the effects of their solutions. Community mapping, popular education, data collection and engagement are treated as project-by-project checkboxes, instead of a living—vital, even—civic process for understanding what is needed and what is possible. Instead, a living memory and a values-driven approach to our social contract leads us to understand and connect to one another, creating a culture of conflict resolution and self evaluation. We believe that ecosystem building is the opposite of Redlining. If Redlining was about dividing people and devaluing them, then undesigning Redlining will take building connections that produce shared value. Disparate organizations and sectors are often trying to build a foundation with bricks and no mortar, often wondering why bricks won’t do what mortar can. The connective infrastructure of gathering spaces, co-ownership, participatory engagement and design, digital tools, popular education and a culture of shared value needs to be built and maintained before large-scale investments pour into our neighborhoods like Tremont. This early, slower investment in people will launch equitable economic and social returns downstream. A focus on projects ignores this, and has left the human infrastructure we have described either starved of resources or nonexistent. The systems that created the divided American landscape continue to loom large. They operate everywhere, not just in Redlined places. Wealth has become for the few, decision making is top-down, and shared values seem quaint instead of vital. The topic of maintaining our systems and places will remain locked in this context until the infrastructure for wealth, design and values are regenerated. Without a clear intention and understanding of our historic, race-driven decision making, and by focusing on our own corners and not the bigger picture, we fail in our attempts to promote sustainable and equitable community development. The stakes are high. It’s time we take seriously the task of Undesigning Redlining. – Braden Crooks and April De Simone are co-founders and partners of designing the WE, a for-benefit design studio positioned within the fields of social innovation and community driven social, cultural, and economic development. Braden is a gardener turned landscape architect who entered into the fray of community organizing and advocacy. April has over 15 years of experience in strategically designing, developing and launching for-profit, non-profit and government projects."
53,Philosophies Of The Material World,https://urbandesignforum.org/philosophies-of-the-material-world-a-conversation-about-the-art-and-architecture-of-maintenance/,"July 11, 2019","Mierle Laderman Ukeles Official Artist-in-Residence at New York’s Department of Sanitation since 1978. A survey exhibition of Ukeles’s 50-year career was presented at the Queens Museum September 2016–February 2017. Hilary Sample Co-founder of MOS Architects, Associate Professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, and author of Maintenance Architecture, published by MIT Press in December 2016. Caroline Bauer Program Director at the Urban Design Forum, now Studio Manager at the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity. February 12, 2018 Avery Hall, Columbia University This conversation has been edited and condensed. No artist has drawn more attention to maintenance than Mierle Laderman Ukeles. Her Manifesto for Maintenance Art (1969) reframed maintenance work in the home, in the workplace, and in public as a form of creative practice. As artist-in-residence at the New York City Department of Sanitation, she shook hands with every employee of the Sanitation Department over the course of a year. She later orchestrated ballets of workers, trucks, and barges in New York and cities around the world. Here, she speaks with Hilary Sample, architect, founding principal of MOS, associate professor at Columbia GSAPP, and author of Maintenance Architecture, as well as Caroline Bauer, Studio Manager at the Mayor’s Office of Economic Opportunity and former program director at the Urban Design Forum, where she conceived and led the Maintaining series. Hilary Sample: Mierle, your work has been especially important to me for thinking about the subject of maintenance as it relates to architecture. Your work crosses multiple social conditions: from the home, where daily cleaning takes place, through to projects in and about the city—I’m thinking here of the projects with the New York City Department of Sanitation workers, from you shaking their hands (Touch Sanitation Performance, 1979-80) to cladding the garbage trucks (The Social Mirror, 1983). It was an epiphany of sorts when I first read your writings and viewed your projects. In speaking about maintenance, your work frees us from the constraints of what we understand—and has become ingrained in our social structures—about what it means to clean versus maintain something, be it a house or the city. It challenges the rhetoric of cleaning and the domestic, and our thinking about who does what in society. Your work tries to break out of these stereotypes and challenge the status quo. Caroline Bauer: One of our Fellows cautioned us about using the word “maintenance” too much in this series; it can be too dry, too technical. She recommended the phrase “caring for,” as a good alternative. Do you think a shift in the language we use would make this more of a popular topic? Mierle Laderman Ukeles: In 1969, when I wrote Manifesto for Maintenance Art, I used the word “maintenance” because it was so stripped out of our culture. I did name the other half of the manifesto, which was a proposal for an exhibition, “CARE.” I always saw these two terms as inextricably linked, but the ambition of the Manifesto was to change the culture itself. That needed a system-wide overhaul. “Maintenance” was more system-wide. HS: As I was beginning to look at this subject of maintenance, I had spent the majority of my architectural education looking at the domestic and housing, especially around issues of women and working and living in the city. So, when I saw your project I Make Maintenance Art One Hour Every Day (1976), it had a profound effect upon my thinking. Here is woman who, on her own, with no support either physically or financially, enters the museum and cleans it. She photographs it, she writes about it, she make small drawings of it, assembles it. Without question your project is an act of “caring for,” but by using the word “maintenance” you’re putting this performance into the public, scaling it beyond the domestic and what we might typically associate “caring for” with. CB: Mierle, this has a lot of resonance with your piece One Year’s Worktime at the Queens Museum. MLU: Yes, that documented every eight hour shift—one whole year of work time. What does work time mean? If you are the boss, you have the right to tell the worker: this is what you do for eight hours. After eight hours, they leave, and you no longer have a claim on them. That’s the claim you have on this human worker. This is a maintenance philosophy—and what is it? It’s about time. It is saying, “we make the choice to live in the present moment”. And I think that is an architectural premise: we remove the leftovers from yesterday, so that when we walk, we walk on the surface of now. This is a philosophy that has become a huge infrastructure system. It costs billions of dollars to remove yesterday, and it’s actually an architectural decision. HS: To expand on your point about living in the present moment, it’s complicated for making architecture. Architects struggle with how to deal with contemporary conditions, be it the environment, climate, social, economic, etc. This is very different to what was previously built, not only materially but philosophically. With Modernism, architects tried to create buildings that look eternally new. And we still operate with that premise that buildings should perhaps be around forever and that their appearances are always effortlessly kept up. Architectural education reinforced the philosophy of being effortlessly and eternally new—we only need to think of those luminous Ezra Stoller photographs, among others, that exhibit modern buildings as exquisite objects devoid of life and time. All of the work done by the maintenance worker is never included. It is invisible effort. As architects we continue to buy into that by not being more inclusive with the figures that we include in our illustrations of buildings and cities. CB: There is also a practice, in State and City budgeting, of deferred maintenance—restricting money for infrastructure maintenance in order for something to eventually become a capital project. To me, that’s a negative example of living in the moment. It allows us to say, “We’ll wait until another time to repair this cantilevered portion of the BQE.” MLU: Deferred maintenance. What the hell does that mean? Until it goes over the edge? CB: In a way. Until the costs get so high they become a capital project. MLU: Moving from the expense to the capital budget is like moving between two different philosophies of the material world. CB: Hilary, this reminds me of an Andy Warhol quote you included in your book: “In New York you have to clean so much, and when you’re finished, it’s not-dirty. In Europe, people clean so much, and when they’re finished, it’s clean.” Do you think that New York’s dirt, deferred maintenance crisis, et cetera, is part of our charm? Or do you see a different vision for our future? HS: I do think there is a particular character to New York and its wornness, contrasted with its new neighborhoods. Living amongst brownstones it is easy to see how quickly materials break down. In terms of the future, learning from other cities’ best practices and applying them is critical. If we were to think about the city in time, the work necessary to its upkeep really shouldn’t be thought of later but now, and as part of the challenge of development. These are important lessons for students just starting in architecture. Architects have been so caught up in technology, and learning about software, programs, and digital media, which are important, but should not replace an intense understanding of the physical world and all its properties. New York could do much more through a variety of scales of intervention. MLU: I did a performance work in Rotterdam, a city with a huge presence of heavy industry. In the section offices of the sanitation workers there—where they come to get dressed, have lunch—each worker has a closet, and the closet is heated because it often rains. They’ll come in for lunch, they’ll hang up their raincoat or jacket, which is wet. And by the time they are finished with lunch, they go back out on the street with dry clothes. Second, they have a huge amount of glass in their lunchroom. Beautiful glass walls, modernist drapes. I think the furniture was by Alvar Aalto. And lunch was hot. And they had a lot of bird cages. If Sanitation workers from New York saw this, they would faint right on the floor. Maybe that’s what Andy was talking about. Something about their structure of labor—there was such a high level of respect of how they were treated. And how the sanitation workers in Rotterdam responded to the work ballet we all did together was so light-hearted—more than any other country I did it in. CB: New York is the richest city in the world, next to Tokyo. So it’s curious to me why we aren’t able to do things like that. HS: While researching maintenance, I was working as an architect at OMA in Rotterdam. Living in the Netherlands presses upon you their extraordinary accomplishments in maintaining pretty much everything around you, from the water, land, buildings, waste, to social structures, and so on. MLU: Rotterdam could be filthy because of all the industry. CB: Right. It’s an expression of what we, culturally, place value on. I’m also hearing from both of you that a focus on maintenance highlights all of the underlying issues that otherwise go unnoticed, such as labor. For example, Mierle, in your piece I Make Maintenance Art Every Day, you’re looking at the maintenance staff of 55 Water Street and revealing how important their work is. I was touched by how you had two openings for that piece, including one for the people that work the night shift. MLU: Yes, the opening was at midnight. Their work is at night, but most of the people that work in that building work during the day. I invited 300 maintenance workers to consider one hour of their regular work “maintenance art” if they decided to participate. And they each wore a button saying “I Make Maintenance Art One Hour Every Day,” for the five weeks of the exhibition. At that time, the Whitney had a branch on the second floor, but I spent days and night shifts—I practically lived in that building during that period—going around with a Polaroid, and I would take a picture of a person doing their regular, everyday work. But then I transferred over the power to name to the worker. I showed them the picture of what they were doing, and I asked them to name the image. The definition of what the viewer saw was not up to me, but rather up to the workers. Over 700 of these decisions were mounted on the wall in the museum, and the workers in the building said that they felt like they had a place in the museum for the first time. They were a very critical audience. I loved that. The power of naming moved from me to them, and that was really a collaborative effort. That’s the building. You don’t know who these people are until they tell you. CB: I think an explicit focus on maintenance brings out those stories that are otherwise totally invisible. MLU: Absolutely. That was a big motivator for me: to get out there, and see who these people are—to make their work transparent. CB: It reminds me of another work, Washing (1974), outside AIR Gallery on Wooster Street. You were just scrubbing, tirelessly, the grit and grime off of a New York City sidewalk. MLU: Very dirty! So dirty. My rags were just shredding, and I realized that I didn’t have enough material to keep going. CB: And then this man comes over with an armful of rags. MLU: The super. You know what he said to me? He said, “Here.” That’s all he said. And then I could keep working. He didn’t say, “Why is this art?” or “What are you doing?” He said, “Here.” That blew me away. At that moment I knew I wanted to work with others. The completion of a work couldn’t come from just me, it also had to come from this man who said: “Here.” HS: As you were talking, I came up with three ideas for new architecture studios with my students. Have you ever done one of those? MLU: No! HS: Would you be interested? MLU: Maybe! HS: Visiting the housing studio at Columbia would be wonderful! You could just show up and talk to them. MLU: I would love to do that. Because I think it’s really urgent for people to learn how to talk to each other."
54,A Plea to End the Crisis Narrative,https://urbandesignforum.org/a-plea-to-end-the-crisis-narrative/,"July 11, 2019","By Jamie Maslyn Larson Is crisis the only catalyst for change these days? Natural disasters, economic recessions, and terrorism have all affected the way our cities look over the last two decades. At the same time, politicians, civic leaders, and designers have appropriated a narrative about the role of the public realm in contending with these crises—casting it as a setting to honor, assemble and demonstrate; to provide protection from climate change; or to create new “world-class” destinations and identities for challenged neighborhoods. Absent a crisis, it seems the “old fashioned” way of planning for our cities—which is incremental and deliberate, builds consensus across audiences over time, pilots and tests ideas, and makes step-by-step policy shifts—isn’t commanding public attention. In an era when we’re hit with alarming headlines nearly every day, how can we, as a design and advocacy community, make things as seemingly mundane as maintenance and equity relevant? We need to escape the dramatic cycle of panic and crisis, and resist the lure of sexy trophy projects. And we need to reengage with processes that create a broader vision and narrative for all of our constituents, including the underserved. This will require an apolitical infrastructure, community education, and measurable results that demonstrate progress. Maybe this idea makes you yawn. Perhaps you think this is idealistic or naïve. You might be thinking, “How could we possibly hold the community’s interest through a long, step-by-step process?” Or, “We could never brand this to sell merch!” As a landscape architect who plants trees for future generations to enjoy, I know that in my profession we sign up for making long-term plans that may never come to fruition in our lifetime. The long game is the game. But having observed the shift to “branded” public space projects—and having experienced the hypercompetitive race to win this type of work—I see a lot of wasted energy by talented professionals competing to make the newest and coolest project. Every day we have limited time and are pulled in many directions. Bending away from the crisis mode or the latest high-profile competition, and instead exerting more effort toward significant issues like maintenance and equity is important for all of us to do. Why maintain? Our failure to address maintenance erodes our community fabric. For parks in particular, one challenge is that it’s hard to notice the slow erosion of quality over a long period of time—it creeps up on us. Parks are living and linked systems that simultaneously grow and decay, responding to seasons, weather, and human interaction. When a park is healthy, it is beautiful and clean, becoming the focal point of a neighborhood. When it isn’t cared for, it can be sad at a minimum and unsafe at worst. Maintenance is an equity issue because it is funded unevenly. In desirable business districts like Bryant Park or expensive neighborhoods like Battery Park City, there is nifty financing that provides a dedicated source of funding for maintenance. Where friends organizations exist—typically in desirous neighborhoods where parks boost real estate values—individual or corporate philanthropy steps in because they have a vested interest in their park’s quality. But most places in the city lack either. All of this coalesces in the health of our communities: when we lose a single tree due to lack of maintenance, we lose something that cools our city, reduces air pollution and carbon dioxide, and offers a nice place to sit in the shade. When we have broken play equipment, we lose more than just a place for kids to let loose. We lose a venue for generations to share space together, a feature that allows kids to get their blood and imaginations pumping, and a setting that gives parents a break. A deeper look at “world-class parks” Let’s look closely at one type of public space that attracts headlines and funding, and is perhaps the most yearned for type of landscape architecture project: the “world-class park.” The world-class park says it all about who we build our cities for—not for our residents, but as a spectacle for a global audience. In the early 2000s there was a radical shift in the way we positioned parks in our cities. They became recognized as part of the toolkit that could transform our cities from old, ragged industrial wastelands to fun, hip, and leisurebased. Suddenly landscape architects were “at the table,” determining the shape of these new neighborhoods alongside politicians, economists, city leaders, architects, and planners—a position of authority that harks back to Olmsted’s power and leadership. It seemed that every RFP issued was for the design of a “world-class park” and nothing could have been better for landscape architects. The budgets were astronomical (finally!). Our leading designers were practically rock stars! Landscape architects finally had their Bilbao effect in the High Line. What brought about this shift toward building world-class parks in our cities, as opposed to investing in incremental, more distributed park improvements? It wasn’t an altruistic desire to bring accessible green space to long-forgotten neighborhoods. It wasn’t to head off climate change challenges with greener solutions; this was long before Superstorm Sandy brought that issue to New York City. And it wasn’t because building parks and public spaces was a new-fangled idea; there are many relevant 19th and 20th-century parks that already demonstrated the correlation between parks and healthier, safer, and more economically robust communities. Rather, the world-class park was instrumental in shaping a new urban lifestyle “brand” that promised cities a lifeline in the face of (what we were told was) certain economic peril. In the late 1990s cities saw declining federal support, so there was a desperate need to make up funds to maintain budgets. On top of that, with the evisceration of urban industry and declining middle-class jobs, cities had empty waterfronts and needed to attract the new economy— particularly technology and tourism—and its high-paid talent to bolster their tax bases. A now-familiar narrative followed: cities needed to act quickly to beat out London, San Francisco, Toronto, or Singapore for their survival. Every major city was pitted against the others and strove to demonstrate their “competitive advantages,” their “quality of life,” and their “authentic, sustainable” urban lifestyle. World-class parks and public spaces were as integral as cocktail bars, hipsters, and Zipcars in modeling these aspirations. The Politics of Parks In New York City, the world-class park was a key part of a broader plan by the Bloomberg administration to attract the creative economy and bolster quality of life, which also included major rezonings and heavy support for the tourism industry. The Bloomberg administration added more than 850 acres to the city’s park system through projects like Brooklyn Bridge Park, the High Line, and Governors Island. (Full disclosure: I was Principal-in-Charge for Governors Island Park when I was at West 8). So, after a decade of major investment in world-class public space improvements, how has this worked out for the city? Or shall I say, who has it worked out for? It would be ridiculous to say that these bold public improvements have not, helped the city become safer, greener—and frankly, prettier. But let’s face it: the city is barely affordable for me, let alone for residents that work in the service industry, younger people, and the remaining working class. Plus, we had essentially abandoned investing in parks in less affluent areas. So questions about who we are building parks for are as critical as interrogating where we are building them. The de Blasio administration’s approach to parks investment is almost diametric to Bloomberg’s world-class park approach. Much of the current budget is invested in improvements for existing parks across all boroughs, but the administration falls behind in adding new park acreage. Given that the city’s population continues to grow, and with existing parks at record usage, many argue that both strategies are needed. Yet as long as budgets remain stagnant, choices need to be made, and the zero-sum game strikes again. Coming up with a reasonable funding plan for parks maintenance is not rocket science: we have to pay for it with our taxes and share this revenue throughout the city. Park advocates have rallied to get the City’s budget for parks on par with other cities like Minneapolis and Seattle (which would take it from today’s spend of about .6 percent to 1 percent), which would add $385 million to the existing annual budget of approximately $500 million. The funds, if approved, could do a lot to expand and enhance parks across the city, add additional maintenance staff, and care for existing parks. And given the administration’s tangential goals in programs like Vision Zero, affordable housing, and planning for resiliency, park projects could be bundled with other investments to contribute to the delivery of multiple benefits for a broad range of constituents. Does letting go of “world-class” mean we let go of design excellence too? As a person that values the beauty and experiential qualities of great design, I think there is a fundamental fear that the alternative way of planning our cities—i.e. stepping away from “world-class” parks mode—means a lack of design. I have heard someone say that we should design for “good enough” parks in less privileged neighborhoods. What does that even mean? No details? No craftsmanship? We should not go down that rabbit hole toward a metric that is impossible to define or measure and, moreover, starts from a position of pessimism. In order to retain capital budgets and political momentum, park advocates and landscape architects have recently been repositioning parks as “critical infrastructure” rather than a decorative accessory. This has both helped and hurt us in the conversation about parks design and maintenance. It’s helped because it puts parks on par with necessary expenditures like repairing roads and storm water systems. But it’s hurt because it devalues design. We must acknowledge that parks bring an element to people’s lives that goes beyond the “serviceable.” I’m talking about the same reason we seek out food that tastes good or listen to music—it is pleasurable. Everyone deserves access to some pleasure in their lives, not just those who can afford it. Making pleasurable places means not only fixing sidewalks and adding basketball courts to our parks, but integrating culture, beauty, comfort, and surprise. It should be ok to acknowledge this—to say it out loud—without fear of getting chastised for being out of touch. So, what can designers do? As designers we are poised to answer these challenges. We are natural disrupters of repetitive thinking and are adept at trying something new. So, I am making a personal plea for your action and involvement in this important work that may not win you a design award or earn you a TED talk. First, let’s start with an easy proposition: take the position that everyone deserves access to quality public space–not just “good enough” public space. Next, if you are on a jury for any design award, feel free to drool over the pharmaceutical campuses and public spaces with multi-million dollar budgets, but please also consider projects that are making a big impact in underserved neighborhoods. These are the herculean projects of our profession, ones that bring a joy to the lives of our neighbors. Finally, if you are going to invest your team’s time and resources in a design competition in another city, why not make an investment with pro bono work in our city as well? On a deeper level, we need to give more thought to the political narratives that frame our work. Every time a new challenge emerges and the story we hear is, “We have to do this or our city will fail!” we are not only falling into the trap of planning by crisis, but we are also neglecting the steady, less glamorous ways we can shape our cities—through areas like equitable design, and by addressing questions like how to pay for and maintain public space, and how to create jobs around this. All of this probably means doing things differently than you have in the past. And change is hard to do. Try taking little steps. It is far easier and more fun to gossip about the hottest new design than talk about maintenance at parties. Go ahead and do that, but when you’re at work and want to challenge yourself and your colleagues to grow and deepen your ideas and practice, talk about maintenance and equity. Read more articles about social justice issues. Support and value the efforts and people that contribute to the slow, steady, incremental work that will make all of our neighborhoods healthier, safer, greener—and yes, world-class. – Jamie Maslyn Larson is Director of Landscape at BIG NYC, bringing with her over 20 years of experience as a leader of projects that embody the integration of transformation and design excellence.

55,Maintenance: A Culture and a Choice,https://urbandesignforum.org/maintenance-a-culture-and-a-choice/,"July 11, 2019","By Deborah Marton Regrets tinge our conversations about maintenance. We know we should fix our failing subway system, keep our streets clean, upgrade the plumbing in public schools, renovate Penn Station; we could go on—but, well, there’s just not enough money. There are other (read: new) things that must be built first. Innovation! Disruption! Maintenance lives in the shadow of the novel and shiny. But good maintenance is not a naming opportunity. It’s not depreciable. It won’t get you re-elected. It’s invisible. In the abstract, we agree that if we build something we should care for it. But the way we actually allocate resources paints a different picture of our values. New York is one of the richest cities on the planet; the reality is our maintenance problems are rooted in political, social, and financial structures that lack integrity when measured against our publicly expressed ethics. As individuals and as a city, we are extraordinarily generous and inventive. We must—and we can—reinvent how we finance and steward our shared environment to reflect what we really care about. To some extent, our failure to properly fund maintenance is an equity issue. As the income gap widens, wealthier segments of our population privately fund some of the services necessary for a smooth day-to-day existence. But universal suffering prevails when the basic infrastructure of society fails. All our lives are compromised by dysfunctional public transit, unsafe roadways, bridge collapses, filthy streets and parks. The fiber of our lives is inextricably bound to complex systems like transit networks, the internet, energy grids, and resilient shorelines. These systems deteriorate and become outdated unless we conceive and care for them as though we expect them to serve us well into the future. Our refusal to invest in maintenance is a symptom of a larger problem. As a culture we have lost faith in the long term. Elected officials charged with resourcing the maintenance of these systems are embattled and underpaid. Election cycles of two or four years force officials to govern while engaging in constant campaigning and fundraising efforts. In the 21st century we are adding layers to our city that its original planners could never have imagined, like fiber optics, public wifi, digital alarm systems, and ride-hailing, to name just a few. But in the United States, most government agencies remain structured more or less as they were in the 19th century, as do our expectations. Within their short terms, we expect our elected officials to start new initiatives and complete others. Similar pressures affect the corporate, technological, and financial communities that shape our cities, which adhere to the same ideology of “quarterly capitalism” that dominates civic decision making. These pressures manifest as a dangerous temporal disjunction: complex systems like bridges, energy grids, and food delivery networks require careful and ongoing everyday care that, if done well, results in nothing happening. When it comes to infrastructure, for the most part that’s the outcome we want. By contrast, our business practices, short news cycles and re-election pressures demand immediate action, constant novelty, and short-term results. Frequently the conversation around maintenance centers on money, or rather the lack of money. But if you really think about it, we have access to lots of money, and not just from tax revenue. Every year huge sums are borrowed for all kinds of capital projects. Most of these capital projects are debt-financed over multiple years with funds borrowed through the issuance of bonds. Those capital expenditures are recorded on City balance sheets as long-term assets and depreciated. In other words, the expense doesn’t hit the bottom line immediately because the funds are being used to create a long-term asset; we can spread out the cost, and even better, the value of capital assets decreases over time. Once complete, those streets, schools, bridges, and parks are maintained by expense funds—that is, tax dollars. Unlike capital expenditures, when these dollars are spent, they’re gone immediately. And every year, a portion of the City’s expense budget must pay interest and principal on the City’s debt. The more the city spends on debt service, the fewer funds are available for everything else. Poor maintenance not only inflates the cost of future repairs, but also feeds larger social problems. Almost daily, new data connects the quality of our public environment to mental and physical health. There are real costs that result from a miserable daily commute, growing up surrounded by trash, or more obvious catastrophic failures like a road collapse. But there’s no way to integrate these costs into our annual budget calculations. Critics of current accounting methods do decry structural limitations that bar proper valuation of societal goods, but until new accounting principles are identified and generally accepted, maintenance and its associated benefits are just an expense. No question, we need new housing, classrooms, fire trucks, and sewers. But our emphasis on capital projects at the expense of maintaining what we already have is not just driven by money—it’s a choice. So, what can we do? Those of us engaged in the design and construction of the built environment bear some responsibility for this fixation on the new and short-term. We are enthralled by innovation, in part because the profession and the general public reward our avant-garde creations. And of course, our livelihoods depend on commissions to produce the new. We could shift our thinking and thrive. There are municipal and institutional models that prioritize and reward long-term thinking and action. One such example can be found in the mission of the Toyota Motor Corporation. The famous “Toyota Way” is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company’s managerial approach and production system. It originated in the thinking of W. Edwards Deming, an American statistician, engineer, and populist philosopher. Revered in Japan, Deming was largely ignored in the United States until fairly recently, so reclaiming his work for deployment at the urban scale would be poetic justice. The values he embedded in Toyota’s corporate mission provide a compelling model for municipal decision-making, emphasizing integrity and long-term thinking. Here, with slight editing, I reproduce and adapt relevant parts of the Toyota Way as the starting point for a new “Manifesto of Care,” that could change the way we work and how resources are allocated in our hard-charging, dazzling, beloved New York City. The New York City Way: Long-term Philosophy Base your management and design decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals. Have a philosophical sense of purpose that supersedes any short-term decision making. Work, grow, and align every innovation, system, and institution toward a common purpose that is bigger than making money. Understand your place in the history of the City and work to bring the City to the next level. Your philosophical mission is the foundation for all the other principles. Generate value for the client, society, and the economy—it is your starting point. Evaluate every business and municipal function in terms of its ability to achieve this. Be responsible. Strive to decide your own fate. Act with self-reliance and trust in your own abilities. Accept responsibility for your conduct and maintain and improve the skills that enable you to produce added value. Imagine our public realm formed by these tenets. Our every action could be guided by a commitment to public service, by sensitivity to history and equity, and by sustainable strategies that comprehensively incorporate economic, environmental and social well-being. We must embrace long-term values, publicize them through our work and in every interaction with colleagues and clients. Sometimes the long-term solution will require low-cost, easy-to-manage outcomes that may not deploy cutting-edge design or technology. That’s okay, as long as every choice buttresses our collective dignity. Potholes are not dignified; arriving at Penn Station is an affront; walking through trash-filled streets diminishes us. We can do better. – Deborah was recently appointed Executive Director of the Van Alen Institute.

56,Downtown Brooklyn: A Long-term Vision,https://urbandesignforum.org/downtown-brooklyn-a-long-term-vision/,"May 21, 2019","On January 25th, the Urban Design Forum hosted a half-day forum on transforming Downtown Brooklyn into a thriving live-work neighborhood. In our first panel of the day, UDF Executive Director Daniel McPhee moderated a discussion between two distinguished voices in planning: Marisa Lago, Chair of the New York City Planning Commission, and Regina Myer, President of Downtown Brooklyn Partnership. In this conversation, both leaders reflected on the neighborhood’s previous rezoning and investments, and strategized ways to stimulate economic growth for all. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. Daniel McPhee: It’s great to have the two of you here, not just because of the work you’re currently doing, but because you’ve been living and working in the area for years. Regina, you’ve been here for many years thinking about the neighborhood, both with Brooklyn Bridge Park and as Director of the Brooklyn office of City Planning. I think we’ve all been amazed to see the staggering changes in the neighborhood that have taken place over the past few years. And, this is after a half century of trying to rebuild Downtown Brooklyn as a jobs center. What’s different this time? Regina Myer: Well a lot of things are different this time. Leading the rezoning, when I was at the Planning Office, we knew that Downtown Brooklyn was on the verge of something great. But I think when we look back to the early 2000s, we all knew that New York City was on the verge of something great. The level of the investment that we had seen in the 1990s and the incredible, new, safe city realized through Mayor Giuliani’s neighborhood-by-neighborhood commitment to make New York City safe, really had to start with certain opportunities affecting the Borough of Brooklyn, where there was finally a level of interest and level of reinvestment that frankly the borough hadn’t seen in probably 30 or 40 years. Most other projects in the ‘90s in the Borough of Brooklyn were largely public initiatives. Starting to see the private sector think about – whether it be in brownstone Brooklyn or something as big as DUMBO on David Walentas’ initiative, or Greg O’Connell’s initiative in Red Hook – made us feel that Brooklyn was going to be something different in the next era. So, the idea of rezoning Downtown Brooklyn really came to us from thinking towards the future. And when we think about that rezoning, we also should remember that Downtown Brooklyn was also a cultural district, it was also a transit district, it was also a shopping district – and all of those things I think really come together here. Marisa, what’s your perspective? Marisa Lago: My perspective actually spans way, way back. I was born in Brooklyn Heights at a time when the edge of the Heights was full of rundown tenements full of families who, like mine, walked over to the factories in Red Hook. So, for me this transformation has been a large part of my life. It’s important to spark the conversation by giving a couple of facts about what Downtown Brooklyn is today so that we think about the past, but more importantly about the future. We can live here; we can work here; we can learn here; we can shop here; we can play here. At the time of the 2004 rezoning there were fewer than 1,000 homes in Downtown Brooklyn. Today, we have 12,000 homes, 2,000 which are affordable. So, think: there are twice as many affordable homes as there were total homes just 15 years ago. On working, from 2002 to 2015 – that’s the data set that we have – Downtown Brooklyn’s private sector jobs went from 48,000 to 58,000 – a 20% growth. These are jobs from across many great sectors. The beauty of Downtown Brooklyn is that it has really varied retail. We have everything from big box stores to small boutiques to neighborhood-serving retail. One of our challenges going forward is: how do we keep the unique identity of our different retail stores? And what I love, playing in Downtown Brooklyn can mean so many different things. It can mean relaxing in a park. Regina and I actually first worked together in taking the concept of Brooklyn Bridge Park from a planning exercise to putting the shovels in the ground. It can mean enjoying one of the many independent art spaces in the Brooklyn Cultural District that had 3 million visitors last year. My takeaway from all of this is that Downtown Brooklyn is a city in it of itself. It’s a microcosm of greater New York. DM: So, a lot of ink has been spilled lately about the consequences of the 2004 rezoning. You mentioned that the result in the last couple of years has primarily been a surge of housing, whereas the City really tried to bring in more commercial space. What kinds of new infrastructure do we need to see here, then, to accommodate that new residential population? And, who should be held responsible for those improvements? RM: Even though we have a really active streetscape and great transit, we could see a more unified and improved streetscape in certain places, and of course improved service by the MTA. I’d like to see more retail. We all want to see more restaurants. We want to see more places to hang out after work. We had this great announcement last week that Gage & Tollner’s will finally be reinvested in on Fulton Street, which will be incredible. But the reason a lot of people are coming to live here is for work. A chief concern for us is making sure the new office projects are tenanted. If you haven’t already, listen to the podcast Reply All, produced by our own Gimlet Media – it’s symbolic of what’s going on here. The creative industries are happy to be part of Downtown Brooklyn because of all the incredible investment here. You have a cultural district with a lot of arts institutions, so it makes a lot of sense that creative business has come to Downtown Brooklyn. ML: Building on what Regina said, I think we have to continue to focus on public realm. We have the ingredients here. People have jobs, so we should think instead about connections. If Downtown Brooklyn is a city itself, we should think about connections to our suburbs. What about our connections to the parks: how do we get from Downtown Brooklyn to Brooklyn Bridge Park? Or even closer – Fort Greene Park is so close and yet the streetscape in getting there isn’t quite inviting enough. So, I think we should think about how to enliven these places even more. The Urban Design Forum – the folks who are in this room – are a part of it. DM: Let’s discuss the commercial projects that are coming online in the neighborhood. We’ve got One Willoughby, The Wheeler, and 80 Flatbush. There are the proposed 570 and 625 Fulton Street projects. And there are renovations of projects like 57 Willoughby, and the Pioneer Building where we’re sitting. What’s needed to keep the momentum going to keep making this a thriving city? RM: Projects like The Wheeler, One Willoughby Square, and 80 Flatbush are really going to be the next generation of office space in Downtown Brooklyn. Brookfield is also going to be making a tremendous reinvestment in MetroTech. We also have a few things in the pipeline that are equally as important. And a lot of these projects are construed as main streets projects, and that makes perfect sense for the downtown. I know Marisa will talk about this more because a lot of this is under her purview right now, but there’s a ULURP project that has just moved through the Planning Commission. Along Fulton Street there’s a proposal that’s just starting the process, 625 Fulton. And seeing these new projects construed as both residential and office makes perfect sense, as long as you have the site where you can supply the core and the entrances and the visibility. Zoning can be a part of this issue though. Residential is frankly penciled a lot quicker on a lot of these sites. And the development community is obviously drawn to that financing. When we think about furthering commercial development: can we change the zoning to make that sale? Are there tax dollars that can be changed or invigorated? A lot of tax incentives should be directed to Brooklyn and Queens, versus perhaps the tax policy that still exists for Lower Manhattan. DM: On a similar question, a lot of these projects – 80 Flatbush, 625 Fulton – they all ask for more density in exchange for a commercial component. Is height the right incentive to attract commercial or do we need different land use policies and other tools? ML: We’ve reached the tipping point in Downtown Brooklyn where we’re seeing projects that are seeking more density, but seeking density in an area that can accommodate it. We have absolutely unrivaled transit infrastructure here. The East River has emerged as the new spine of the city, given the activity on the Brooklyn waterfront and the new ferry service. We’re rethinking how the city is connected, and that is for the benefit of Downtown Brooklyn. I couldn’t agree more with Regina. If you look at the Mayor’s New York Works plan, it is focused on business centers outside of Manhattan – Downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City being the two most obvious ones, but also Jamaica. I think the challenge in Downtown Brooklyn versus Long Island City is that Long Island City competes with Midtown Manhattan, and the rent differential is much stronger between the Financial District and Downtown Brooklyn. We are seeing developers come in with a residential component, which helps projects pencil out, recognizing there is a very different office market here. We are also seeing projects with schools – something that speaks to the beauty of Downtown Brooklyn. It is this live-work-play neighborhood. We welcome these projects – for example at 80 Flatbush we have a project with residential, commercial, two new schools, and a historic preservation component. That is the kind of good mixed-use projects that we want to see. DM: You are all trying to figure out how to make sure that there are more and more public benefits in each of these projects – whether it’s a school, open space, or transit infrastructure. Is that really the best tool that we have to make sure that these buildings are well designed, good neighbors…? ML: Some of the buildings that are great additions to the skyline are as-of-right buildings. We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact the vast majority of development that occurs in the city is as-of-right. The 2004 rezoning set the stage for buildings to be built as-of-right. Other signature projects go through a public review process when appropriate. It’s interesting. This is a city that is known for being litigious. The Dime Savings Bank building, which is going to be the tallest building, was voted unanimously by the community board when going through its Landmarks approval. That, to me, is a testament to the design. And again, I toss it out to this group: you are the developers, the architects, the landscape architects, and the designers who can contribute high quality work, buildings that contribute to the public realm. It’s not just a matter of the public sector. We need the private sector to shoulder its part. DM: A lot of concern around the change here is that the some of the consequences of the rezoning are displacement of businesses and residents. So what tools do we have at our disposal to continue preserving existing local businesses and ensure they benefit from the neighborhood’s transformation? RM: The good news is – although there has been displacement of some businesses – a lot of development was spawned on vacant land. Not every site has been a history of displacement. A project like 80 Flatbush had a small amount of city office which is going to be relocated, and some retail use. A lot of these sites were really, really underused. I’m seeing certain office users want to stay in Downtown Brooklyn in some of the new construction, which is a really good sign that people recognize this is a great place to stay. When you are talking about retail, there are a lot of other questions that come up. The national retail trends as we all know are changing very, very quickly, but happily people want to come here to shop. Most of our new projects have retail on the ground floor, and we are starting to see really interesting new leases. A lot of new gyms, a lot of new places to work out. These are actually the things that make perfect sense for Downtown Brooklyn given its connectivity. But you are asking this question about what we can do: we can make sure that we have an active private market that responds to all the uses we already have. On the housing side, the great news is that most new rental projects have affordable housing baked into them. ML: The question you ask is a meta question, and I think it goes far, far beyond zoning. We work with an alphabet soup of other city agencies, and getting the mix right isn’t just a matter of design. Zoning is a relatively broad tool and it shouldn’t be dictating which uses go where. Zoning has to stand the test of time. The 2004 rezoning is likely to continue to shape development moving forward. Small businesses can work with the resources that are available to them, whether it’s through a business improvement district or the Department for Small Business Services. But I think the approach that says one should be curating the retail is anti-market and ultimately leads to failure. One good example is at City Point. We see within that complex both Century21, big box retail that draws a lot of people, but also lots of smaller shops with more “Brooklyn” feel. Why? Because that is the mix that keeps people wanting to come to shop. I do think we can improve the streetscape that Regina had referred to before and make Downtown Brooklyn a place that people want to come. Because not only can you shop, you can then hang out and relax along Albee Square Mall. We must create a sense of place, making sure our different retail corridors retain their different feel. DM: I want to pose one last question. One of the things I like most about Brooklyn is the vibrancy of Fulton Mall – it’s just amazing. There are people there all day and all night even though the building stock and public realm isn’t always in the best shape. As we think about how the surroundings are going to change, how can we strengthen that corridor and preserve the retail mix? RM: We spend a lot of time at the Partnership thinking about Fulton Street. And it has changed over the years but the intervention is going in all of the right direction. We care about Albee Square and I’m happy you mentioned it. We just opened a new kiosk that WXY designed, keeping Albee Square really active and complementing what’s going on at City Point. We have a movie theatre on Albee Square open till 1-o-clock in the morning. This, to me, is really a huge transformation – we have almost a 24-hour Fulton Street. Part of this new activity is a result of the new mixed-use development. Macy’s has reinvested in its Fulton Street store – have you seen the new shopping floor? They’ve done a phenomenal job. The Wheeler is going to provide 600,000 sf of office space above Macy’s. And with all the new housing, we are going to see retail that responds to the people now living in Downtown Brooklyn. – Marisa Lago began serving as Director of the New York City Department of City Planning and Chair of the City Planning Commission in March 2017 under Mayor Bill DeBlasio.

57,Starter Homes for the Squeezed Middle: An Interview with Marc Vlessing,https://urbandesignforum.org/affordable-housing-interview-with-marc-vlessing/,"December 13, 2018","The Urban Design Forum hosted its fourth Global Exchange: Private Development, Public Good event with affordable housing developer Marc Vlessing. As chief executive officer for Pocket Living, Marc develops new compact homes sold directly to middle-earning first-time buyers. Buyers are not permitted to rent their properties, and are required to sell to other middle-income Londoners. While compact units have stirred much debate, the Mayor of London endorsed Pocket Living last year with a £25m investment to develop over 1,000 new homes by 2021. Before the off-the-record event, Urban Design Forum Executive Director Daniel McPhee sat down with Marc to learn more about Marc’s perspective and the nuances of the Pocket Living model. Daniel McPhee: I’m curious to hear a little more about how you got into the housing space yourself. I know you started your career in finance, and then as chief executive of a theater and cinema group. Marc Vlessing: The thing that really brought it together was a conversation that I’d had a couple of years ago with one of the projectionists in our cinemas. He said “you know what you have to understand: I do this because I love the cinema; my father loved the cinema. But my son of 12—sitting at home playing on his Nintendo—he’s never going to commute the 1 ½ hours it takes me to get to work. He’s never going to be able to afford to live close to work”. And so, I started to ask myself the question: how are we going to keep these cinemas and theaters alive with people on very modest salaries? And that was the moment when the light went off—if I could set up a housing company that purposely tried to find a way to deliver housing for people on modest salaries in London, that would bring everything that I had done in my career together. DM: One of the most notable things about your housing model is how you’re taking a different approach by building specifically for young first-time buyers, rather than mixing affordable units into all new housing. Why focus on this group of people? MV: What’s really fascinating about them as a cohort is that they have been under-researched and under-served by policy makers. A heck of a lot of effort goes into open market housing. I mean, the banks have to research the market because they’ve got so much of their balance sheets tied up in it. And then, a heck of a lot of academic researchers look at social housing. But middle-market housing—”intermediate” housing, “key worker” housing, “workforce” housing—tends to be really under-researched. To me Pocket was a market opportunity. It was a policy opportunity. Apparently one of the greatest Canadian ice hockey trainers once said that the best ice hockey player ever was not the guy who went to the puck, but it was the guy who went to where the puck was going to be. And I think what we did with Pocket was ask where the puck was going to be. We were asking ourselves this question 10 years before the politicians woke up to it, and by the time they woke up to it we were already there starting to build this housing. Pocket tower at Mapleton Crescent in Wandsworth DM: But why target singles and couples in particular? How are you using design as a way to build for those people? MV: The formula that we came up was a compact one of 400 square foot flats—they are not micro! Clearly if you want to make something more affordable, then making it more compact is one way to go. But our units also had to meet stringent design criteria that we set for the product in terms of economics and functionality: oversized fenestration to maximize daylight; complex wiring diagrams to maximize night lighting; continuous flooring; a living room big enough for a four-seater IKEA sofa; a bedroom big enough for a king-sized bed, plus side tables and a built-in wardrobe. We came up with this one-bedroom model because a building with a mix of two, three, or four-bedroom flats returns a much lower margin than on one-bedroom flats. The best sites for us are the cheapest land we can buy in the most expensive boroughs—sites that tend to be next to public housing. Then, we are able to price these units through a formula to a deep discount to the market. Our discount is typically 20% to market, and of course the planning policy people in London think “Oh, well that’s great, but how do you protect that?” DM: Right, I was going to ask, how are you preserving the affordability after the first buyer decides to sell? MV: We actually imposed on ourselves the care of being the regulator of the product. We set up a team which certifies resales. When you buy a Pocket flat, your lease states that you are not allowed to sell your flat without us certifying that the person you are selling is eligible. The eligibility criteria are that you earn less than a certain amount of income, and that you live and work in the Borough. The household income per year is set by the Mayor of London through his economics unit in something called the “London Plan”, which is the spatial development strategy of London. This was a great hook of which to peg this housing. But we use it as a market mechanism—nobody had really thought about doing that. We created a housing formula without subsidy. There’s nothing financially driven—there’s not financial subsidies, or a grant, or a bequest, or a gift from the state. It’s all about planning density, and then self-regulation. DM: One thing that’s notable about new development in New York is the kind-of surge of amenities: we have flower-arranging workshops, pet spas…. MV: It’s a nuclear arms race! DM: Exactly. So, could you talk a little bit about how you’re using design in the broader building – not just the unit? MV: To my mind, the kind of people that we build for are so pleased that we built something that’s fit for purpose, as close to the center of town as we can make it, at a cost that is cheaper than renting….they don’t want a car parking space! They haven’t got money for a car parking space. They certainly don’t have money for gyms, and dog compounds. So, the issue doesn’t really arise. It is is a real problem that there has been this amenity warfare among developers in a place like New York because it is really, really hard to come off that stuff. It becomes so out of reach for the average person. I think New York is absolutely right to rethink what a utilitarian approach to housing for singles and couples could be. We’re in the mess that we are with the housing market because we’ve been giving no thought to singles and couples—young professionals—over the last 15, 20, 25 years. The interesting thing about this is that politically you go to Mayors on the Left and on the Right and you talk about singles and couples, and you can immediately see their political filtering mechanisms, which go: “Yeah, but they don’t really matter do they, because what I really should be doing is public housing for families.” While there is always a need for more public housing for families –I’m very supportive of public housing for families—the truth of the matter is that we’re in the mess that we are with the housing market because we’ve been giving no thought to singles and couples—young professionals—over the last 15, 20, 25 years. They are economically so important. Secondly, they can vote with their feet—they can move away from these places if they become completely unaffordable. They are not hugely demanding. They work so much they don’t have time to be political about housing. I think one of the reasons we are in the situation we are in is that the people who complain about housing problems tend to be families. There is a political imperative here for the 30-somethings to make their voices much more heard because ultimately that’s what drives the game. Marc in conversation with Michael Sorkin and Beatrice Sibblies at the New Museum DM: Now, reflecting on the families a little bit, do you see Pocket units as starter homes for people thinking about starting a family in a couple years? Or, are you trying to read demographics and say that there are a lot of singles in cities? MV: If I’m honest, I’ve changed my view about this. I thought what I was doing is creating a staging post. What I now realize that we’re doing is creating a new format, a lifestyle, for people who are almost certainly going to be staying in those homes a lot longer than we ever thought they would. Which is why I’m so pleased that we never went for micro. You can stay in a Pocket flat for a long time, and people do. What I think is happening—and this is not caught by the statistical data tracking of governments yet—is that there is a much, much larger group of people now who are going to be single or couple-based because they are not getting married, they are not having children, they are living longer, and they are divorcing rather often. We reckon that of the new household growth in the UK, 60-70% is going to be singles and couples. If that is right, then this is a demographic shift that we haven’t anticipated at all within cities. Then, Pocket is not a staging post towards family life, but it is a form of housing that is going to have to be expanded dramatically. DM: You also focus on community preference–a term we use in New York. You’re looking for buyers who already live in a neighborhood. Could you talk a bit more about tenant selection, and the kinds of people that are now living in Pocket? MV: From initial planning onwards, we commit that we will only sell to people who either live or work in the borough–we have 33 boroughs in London–on a household income level that falls below the affordability threshold set by the Mayor of London. Our selection process is enshrined within the planning system. What’s interesting about our buyers as a group is that the average age is 32, the average income is £42,000, and they have on average been renting for eight years. 85-90% are single. 10% are couples. And what’s really fascinating is that there is a skew amongst the singles in favor of single women. We reckon about 65% are single women. We’re trying to dig into the data to try to understand what’s behind that skew. Pocket development at Fermoy Road in Westminster DM: It would be helpful to talk about politics and how you’ve been able to get this done. I think your model is a little unusual and flies very much in the face of what New York City is trying to do, which is mix these mandatory affordable rentals in new developments—something London is doing as well. So, how are you able to make the case–whether to the planning authority, or council members–that this is the right model to pursue? MV: I learned fairly early on that the politics of housing does not break down on party lines. It breaks down on age brackets. So, if you have group of councilors or politicians over the age of 50, who have lots of money tied up in their own housing entity, they find it quite difficult to understand Pocket. When you have politicians in their 30s who might not have been able to get a decent flat to rent or to buy, then you’re having a different conversation. If you want to disrupt something so slow, conservative and stodgy as planning policy and housing markets, then you need to focus your activities where you are going to be able to shift the dial–so go for younger politicians. The best of the politicians are proud of it because they feel they can say to their electors that they are doing something. D: And do you find that the politicians are good partners in cutting some of the tensions that new development often engenders in neighborhoods? MV: I think there are a lot of brave politicians, who go into politics for the right reason who know that the average NIMBY is not going to be a friend of any development process. The politicians that we work with stand proud and shoulder-to-shoulder in the process. The only two kind of people who can afford to live are either people on £150,000+ a year, or people who are on public benefit—what kind of community is that? We’re now getting to the point in parts of London where the only two kind of people who can afford to live are either people on £150,000+ a year, or people who are on public benefit—what kind of community is that? And that’s happening in New York as well. A community hollows out once you lose these middle classes. You’re left with very dysfunctional area. It drains the life out of the city. There is a limit to which you can force people to commute unacceptable distances. There is a limit to how much you can ring-fence particular priority groups. And there’s a point at which you just have to become rational—these are economically, socially, culturally, politically important places. And you have to give them the oxygen that they deserve to succeed. DM: It sounds like you’ve been recognized by some high-profile attention from the Mayor. I’m curious to know how that’s changed the way that you are thinking about the future of Pocket and where you can be making a difference. Green glazed-terracotta tile facade of Mapleton Crescent MV: To my mind, the crisis of the middle market is one that you can find in most of the world’s cities. I just came back from Vietnam—Hanoi and Saigon have this problem as well: a squeezed middle. I think that there’s going to be more and more discussion around what the solutions for that middle market might look like. Inherently and inextricably, the solutions are always going evolve around complex public-private provisions. That’s what I think ultimately makes this such an interesting business. Yes, we are a market facing blue-blooded capitalist organization at one level–we are for-profit–but we could not exist without the regulatory cloak of the public sector to whom we owe everything. This two-way process of innovating—it’s on both sides. The public sector has had to innovate as much as we have to made it work. It’s very symbiotic. And although it sounds very pat, it crucially does rely upon trust. To be able to look your politicians and policy-makers in the eye and convince them that what you say you’re are going to do, you’re really going to do. DM: As you’re thinking about coming stateside, what will have to change? MV: Well, this sounds very arrogant, but we have unlimited growth opportunities in our own market. If a politician or a Mayor wants us, they’re going to have to, not woo us—you know we’re an easy date, we’ll come—but they are going to have to give us something to get us into it. A nice big juicy piece of public land wouldn’t be a bad thing. A lot of our properties are on public land. A housing strategy director who is prepared to stretch the rules and play with us in order to make things possible rather than telling us why it’s all impossible. A framework of understanding in which we all recognize that we’re going to do one of these developments to see how it works, that can kick the tires off, and then we’ll do many more. That’s the city I would love to work with in America. For more information about Pocket Living, please visit their site.

Giovania Tiarachristie ▷ Supporting Worker Cooperatives in Sunset Park Posted on April 17, 2018 In a moment of increased political complexity for immigrant communities in the United States, a certain type of response to protect and support immigrant communities better is also increasing: worker cooperatives (henceforth, “worker co-ops”). While worker co-ops are not a new concept, they have nearly tripled in New York City in recent years, and the leaders of the majority are immigrants. (New York City Department of Small Business Services, 2016). Our goal is to illustrate worker co-ops as a means of empowerment, economic and otherwise, for immigrant communities, and to outline a set of recommendations for how the City, foundations, and other organizations can better support worker co-ops. This report focuses particularly on Sunset Park, Brooklyn, an epicenter of worker co-op development over the last ten years. PART I: OVERVIEW What is a worker co-op? Worker co-ops can be defined primarily as businesses in which “member-owners invest in and own the business together,” profits are shared, and decisions are made democratically (Community Wealth, 2017). A worker co-op leverages the abilities of its members and accounts for their personal needs, thus building social and financial capital and bringing increased opportunities for individual savings, stable employment, and long-term development into a community. The majority of worker-coops in the United States exist in the Northeast, the West Coast, and the Upper Midwest, and are predominately small businesses in the retail and service sectors. How does a worker co-op work? In worker co-ops, members are considered “worker-owners,” accepting responsibilities with their membership. Differing from employees of more traditional corporations, worker-owners democratically oversee and manage profits, decision-making, and leadership of the business. The business model includes a financial investment into the worker co-op from all worker-owners and their control over voting shares, with one vote per member. In worker co-ops, worker-owners can dictate their own schedules, decide upon pay and salaries, and design other arrangements that work best for them. In this way, worker-owners can create their own jobs and gain control of their own financial futures, two opportunities frequently unavailable for immigrants in the more traditional economy. Why do worker co-ops matter particularly to immigrant communities? In the United States, the fastest-growing form of worker co-ops is immigrant-led (Democracy at Work, 2017). The rise of worker co-ops in immigrant communities is perhaps linked to the inclusive, democratic model that mitigates risk of labor exploitation, tends to lack requirements for immigration status, and allows worker-owners to gain greater control over their financial future. What is the Center for Family Life (CLF) In New York City’s Sunset Park neighborhood, immigrant communities have launched more than 15 of the City’s 60 worker co-ops. The Center for Family Life (CFL), a non-profit organization based in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, has managed a Cooperative Business Development Program for the last ten years, providing holistic training and resources on worker co-ops to low-income, predominantly immigrant, communities in the neighborhood. As a result, CFL has incubated the majority of the worker co-ops in Sunset Park. PART 2: WORKER CO-OP PROFILES Worker-owners best describe the benefits of joining a worker co-op. Additionally, directly engaging with worker-owners is an effective method for understanding how best to support worker-owners and worker co-ops. The following three worker co-op profiles are based upon individual interviews with worker-owners and focus groups with three different worker co-ops in March 2018. These conversations occurred in English and Spanish. Golden Steps Golden Steps Elder Care Cooperative provides companionship and home care for elderly New Yorkers, allowing them to stay in their homes. While some worker-owners previously worked for an agency providing similar home care services, others came from factories along the East River waterfront that have scaled back their operations. Many worker-owners are immigrants, proudly having roots in Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, and Puerto Rico. In all cases, worker-owners speak about the tremendous impact of Golden Steps on their personal development: It makes me proud to be part of this co-op because I’ve received so much. As a person, I’ve developed and learned to work with these women, even where we don’t agree. The majority of us left our home countries chasing a dream here in the U.S. and, when we arrived, we realized it’s not as easy as it seems to learn a new language, the culture, and how to live with one another. The cooperative has given us the capacity to do these things and brought the best out of us. In our market, there are many agencies out there that accept people through public programs, Medicare, Medicaid. It makes me proud that when people come to Golden Steps, they are willing to pay money out of their own pocket for our services because we are better at our job than the agencies themselves. We provide a high-quality service, and it is all of us working together. The task of operating Golden Steps does not come without cost, however. Asked to describe challenges of running the worker co-op, most of worker-owners, all of whom have children, expressed the need to make sacrifices in their personal lives. A worker-owner framed an internal conflict in which her desire to strengthen the worker co-op competed with her desire to be with her family: “We can control our own hours, but our interest in growing the co-op can push us as well. We have three jobs: family, the job, and the cooperative.” The future is bright for Golden Steps. An organized application period for new members and an energized existing worker-owner base provide a roadmap for continued services, primarily in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. However, worker-owners also acknowledge the reality of a hostile political climate regarding immigrant communities and people of color more broadly. Working with Golden Steps, I think that if we keep working hard, we’re going to keep doing better. But we can’t ignore the political situation around immigration. There are realities we need to face, but we need to stay calm. It is stressful for the family. It is stressful at work. In business, I think we’re going to continue to succeed. But also, the immigrant families feel threatened in the current political moment with minorities being subject to discrimination. Maharlika Maharlika Cleaning Cooperative provides eco-friendly office cleaning services. Formerly the Damayan Cleaning Cooperative, the founding members of Maharlika were part of the Damayan Migrant Workers Association, which serves and organizes low-wage Filipino workers. While Maharlika is outwardly focused on providing excellent service, it is also inwardly conscious about providing economic opportunity through membership to fellow immigrants and survivors of human trafficking. It enriched my knowledge. I’m handling the books of the cooperative. I already know how to do the balance sheet. It really helps me build up my communication skills. Before, I didn’t do emails or use Google. Right now, it builds my confidence and my independence. I have the courage to talk to people, especially on walk-throughs. It improved me. When I came here, I just went to work. At Maharlika, worker-owners invest considerably in their work. They feel ownership over their work, which leads them to do more for the worker co-op. They see value in increased effort. “It adds income. When I started working in the co-op, I saved the money. I have savings now. I feel so proud because I have savings. The regular job, I couldn’t do that. And now, I have savings.” In considering the future, worker-owners are eager to pass on the institutional knowledge of Maharlika. We don’t know what’s in the future. But it’s a big challenge for us. We need more members. We’re growing old. What we’re learning here, we need to pass it on the young ones. But young people don’t sometimes think about co-ops. Maybe they know housing co-ops only, not like this one. For us, we want to do this so that, in the near future, we will be more economically and financially stable. Trusty Amigos Trusty Amigos Cooperative provides professional dog walking and pet care throughout New York City’s five boroughs. While some members previously worked in pet care or for an agency, others came to the worker co-op from the restaurant industry. The personal background of the worker-owners is also mixed; some members are New Yorkers over numerous generations, while others came from Mexico with family and are now making their life in New York City. The worker co-op affords all worker-owners an opportunity for greater control of their time. Seeing how it is to work in a co-op is different because you’re an owner. It’s good because sometimes as an immigrant, you don’t have the opportunity to be part of a co-op. But the Center for Family Life has given us the opportunity to start this co-op and start working. The person who wants to get ahead can. I used to work 10-12 hours straight, and it’s very tough. Having a family, having kids, it’s hard. You can’t dedicate time to your kids. On this side, you feel more flexible. There’s more time for your family, your kids. I can take them to school. I only have to work a couple hours. But I can go and improve myself. I can take other classes. I can learn new things. I’m happy with it. Forming a worker co-op can be difficult, however. Aside from fostering and cultivating a shared interest in creating a worker co-op, worker-owners need to build up their own capacity not only to provide a service but also to start and run a business. A worker co-op demands a serious commitment of time, resources, and energy. When we started we had heard about the possibility of being owners, of earning more money, of more opportunity. That all sounded good, but it was still difficult at the beginning because starting a cooperative is not easy. It is very difficult because it all needs to start from scratch. The process is long because none of the worker-owners have the capacity to do all the technical stuff that goes into forming the cooperative. From the beginning, it was a year to gain capacities and to launch the service publicly. The meetings were weekly to talk, learn, and share information. The early investment is paying off for Trusty Amigos. Because the worker-owners now possess the knowledge to start worker co-ops, some of the founders are now looking at different models to expand their reach and the Trusty Amigos brand. In hoping to bring this kind of model to more communities, one worker-owner framed it in this way: “There are lot of people, immigrants, people without documentation, who might not make noise about making minimum wage. We need more capacity building and understanding around what co-ops are, both for the community and for people who want to form them.” PART 3: THE IMPACT OF WORKER CO-OPS Through both statistics and personal accounts, a case for the benefits of worker co-ops generally and specifically for immigrant populations is emerging. Overview According to the United Federation of Worker Cooperatives, worker co-ops have proven to be “an effective tool for creating a maintaining sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth, improving the quality of life of workers; and promoting community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to business ownership or even sustainable work options” (Democracy at Work Institute). Unlike those employed by traditional companies, worker-owners participate in distribution of profits, oversight, and often the management of their organizations through a democratic process. Benefits to Individuals with High Socio-economic Risk Data shared by the Center for Family Life (CFL) helps paint a portrait of worker-owners. Worker co-ops employ a group in Sunset Park that, on average, faces a number of socio-economic obstacles, risks, and hurdles. Of the worker-owners who responded to the CFL survey questions, the overwhelming majority (83%) is female. 89% percent of respondents define themselves as Hispanic, with 76% of respondents listing Spanish as their native language and 49% identifying as bilingual. A NYCgov Poverty report highlighted that those of Hispanic origin are at highest risk for poverty within the City (New York City Government Poverty Measure 2005-2015, 2017). Additionally, English-speaking deficiency is often cited as one of the largest barriers to employment for Latinos (John Jay College of Criminal Justice, The Never Ending Cycle of Language Barriers). On average, respondents are first-generation, and the average worker-owner is 38 years old. 27% of respondents have some college education or more, and 18% of respondents were enrolled in an education program. Most respondents are married or with a partner (53%), have children (72%), and rent their apartment (85%). Financial Benefits and Job Satisfaction Based on the data shared by CFL, worker-owners receive a number of financial benefits as a result of their being in a worker co-op. Worker-owners noted increased personal earnings per year and increased average hourly wages. Within the worker co-op, worker-owners earn an average of $17.13 per hour. Prior to entering the worker co-op, average reported hourly earnings were $12.18. For those with supplemental jobs outside of the worker co-op, hourly earnings outside of the worker co-op averaged $13.18. In interviews, some members noted increased stability in wages and reduced working hours as a result of their membership in a worker co-op. Worker-owners receive higher pay and high benefits relative to other firms in the same industry. Worker-owners also find that being part of a worker co-op allows more opportunities to save and build assets. Worker-owners generally reported high job satisfaction. The worker co-ops included in the CFL data noted a lower turnover rate of worker-owners in comparison to that of employees in the same industry but not of a worker co-op. Other Benefits In interviews, worker-owners listed a number of additional benefits of worker co-ops. Some respondents described increased flexibility in schedule. One worker-owner highlighted independence and increased wages: “You don’t have to respond to a boss … You have the choice of taking a client or not. We also earn 3-4x more than if we weren’t our own boss.” Another worker-owner is appreciative for having a voice in a collaborative decision-making process. Some worker-owners noted that worker co-ops provide an opportunity for personal growth, knowledge enrichment, and improved communication skills. They found that, through working in a worker co-op, they generally had increased personal confidence. A worker-owner stated: “The co-op brings the best out of us. It gives the ability to do things we thought we were never able to do.” PART 4: RECOMMENDATIONS With the support of the City Council, the City of New York has invested in supporting worker co-ops throughout the City, helping hundreds of worker-owners and their families overcome social and economic inequalities. NYC Small Business Services through its Worker Cooperative Business Development Initiative (WCBDI) supports various organizations throughout the City in providing resources to start and run worker co-ops, convert existing businesses into worker co-ops, and provide other legal, financial, and one-on-one support. Yet, New York City is changing quickly, demographically and economically. While gentrification may benefit certain worker co-ops whose services cater to young professionals, it simultaneously threatens the housing stability of some worker-owners and the broader affordability of property throughout the community. Based on our discussion with worker co-ops and the Center for Family Life (CFL), below is a set of policy recommendations for the City and other advocates to better support worker co-ops and their members, in the context of a rapidly changing City. These recommendations arose from conversations with worker-owners. Recommendation 1: Build the capacity of worker co-op incubators to expand their services to other immigrant communities Organizations like the CFL in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, provide essential services that support individuals in creating and operating worker co-ops. The services include: technical assistance such as business planning and governance and back-office services, connections to industry experts, specialty trainings and certifications, meeting spaces, and wraparound social services such as language classes and family counseling, otherwise unaffordable for many worker-owners. The demand for worker co-ops is increasing across the City. Other immigrant communities would benefit from this model. The City could play a larger role in helping to expand the capacity of existing and new incubators in order to share the benefits across the diverse immigrant communities of New York City. • Increase City investment in worker co-ops by increasing funding for community-based organizations that help train residents to start and operate worker co-ops. • Create incentives to expand these services to other parts of the City where low-income, especially immigrant communities, can benefit from this democratic model. • Work with established practitioners to build the worker-co-op incubation capacity of other organizations, particularly those that serve and support various immigrant communities that have not yet been reached. • Expand the diversity and cultural competency of existing worker co-op incubator staff to serve other ethnic populations. Recommendation 2: Educate the public about worker co-ops to expand awareness and increase demand for their services Just like many other business, the success of worker co-ops relies on public knowledge, demand for services, and ability to compete against larger companies and other competitors. If more New Yorkers knew about the worker co-op model and how it benefits particularly immigrant worker-owners, there could be greater demand for services and, thus, growth of worker co-ops across the City. Discussions with worker-owners from different worker co-ops revealed a common theme: The public lacks understanding about, and awareness of, worker co-ops. While worker co-ops individually promote their services to potential clients, the City could also play a larger role in promoting worker co-ops as a whole. Public education that informs New Yorkers about worker co-ops would help existing worker co-ops to be better understood in communities and could build demand for new worker co-ops. • Place general advertisements about worker co-ops on the subway or in buses with direction to an app and/or directory of worker co-ops across the City. • Educate City employees on procurement with worker co-ops and include worker co-ops as a searchable category on the City’s Vendex/Procurement and Sourcing Solutions Portal. Recommendation 3: Target housing preservation and fair housing enforcement in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to protect worker-owner tenants from displacement Gentrification in neighborhoods like Sunset Park, Brooklyn, places pressure on the housing stock and increases the cost of living. Many worker-owners are people of color and of immigrant backgrounds, communities that have reported increased discrimination in a gentrifying housing market. Worker-owners convey that landlords have denied them housing because of their race/ethnicity, presence of children, and/or immigration status, all of which practices are illegal under fair housing laws. Yet, many worker-owners are unaware of their rights and resources as tenants and distrust government enforcement. Many often fear interaction with the government generally given growing national xenophobic attitudes. • Ensure multi-lingual outreach on tenants rights and resources, particularly related to fair housing. • Create safe assurances to encourage reporting. • Increase proactive auditing and enforcement of housing quality, fair housing, and anti-discrimination laws. • Target landlord outreach to increase preservation of existing affordable housing. Recommendation 4: Incentivize a network of affordable spaces to help worker co-ops find meeting spaces Gentrification and rising retail rents also make it challenging for worker co-ops to find affordable meeting spaces and commercial spaces into which to expand. As the number of worker co-ops grows, meeting space through incubator organizations also becomes limited. For worker co-ops looking to scale up their operations, an incubator space cannot fill the same role as a dedicated office space. • The City can create financial benefits to incentivize local entities, such as Industry City, the public library, the Community Board, and others to create a network of free or low-cost meeting space locations for worker co-ops throughout the City. • The City can also support retail rent stabilization in gentrifying neighborhoods to control retail rents. Recommendation 5: Enable immigrant-owned businesses to obtain MWBE certifications Minority/Women-owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs) certifications open up opportunities for small businesses, especially with increasing State and City requirements and targets for MWBE procurement. Many worker co-ops are made up of women and minorities. However, the current City permitting and certification processes pose barriers to accessing this opportunity for immigrant worker-owners. For example, MWBE certification requires 51% of owners to be citizens or permanent residents. For worker co-ops, many of which have 4-9 owners or more, this requirement can be challenging to achieve. • Work with worker co-ops and incubators to identify barriers in MWBE permitting and certification processes. • Open up opportunities for disadvantaged businesses through more equitable MWBE-certification procurement. • Conduct more trainings and workshops around MWBE permitting and certifications that meet the needs of immigrant worker-owners.

A Co-Live Scenario for Newly Arrived Immigrants to New York City Posted on April 17, 2018 New York City thrives on immigrants. Yet, complex issues make settling difficult for new arrivals. This project proposes a co-live scenario with integrated supportive services for the early transition of new arrivals to New York City. It empowers new immigrants to achieve a sustained, enriched, and quality living experience. We first summarize a general picture of new arrivals, including their experience, housing conditions, as well as challenges and opportunities. We then introduce the concept of co-living, regarding its historical precedents, current market, and potential opportunities for immigrant housing in NYC. Next, we prototype CO-LIVE as a new housing typology at the unit, building, and neighborhood scales with design principles and planning strategies. Finally, we validate this prototype by working collaboratively with a local housing advocacy organization for a proposed site in Richmond Hill, Queens. NEW ARRIVAL EXPERIENCE Finding affordable, stable, and quality housing is an essential part of arriving for new New Yorkers, and one of their greatest challenges. Since 2000, the immigrant population growth rate in NYC has surpassed citywide overall growth. Meanwhile, public housing, government assisted housing, or rent-stabilized housing has not been able to catch up to meet these needs. Lack of accessible housing options have forced newly arrived immigrants to seek alternative options. Typically, immigrants need to settle a larger household size (3.1 persons). This often places families in overcrowded living conditions (three times more dense than that of native-born New Yorkers). In addition to facing physical housing challenges, newly arrived New Yorkers also are confronted with policy barriers, regulation constraints, and market discrimination due to socio-economic disadvantages and limited resources. As a result, many undocumented immigrants live in illegally converted units, basement units, or overcrowded rentals. One estimate puts the number of such units at more than 100,000 citywide, concentrated in neighborhoods with high proportions of immigrants. As immigrants settle in New York, they look to their families and immediate networks for help, and if aware, approach local Community Based Organizations (CBOs) for resources. In new housing developments that target the this newly arrived population, we consider it vital to integrate such social resources. In such spaces, residents can easily gain access to language help, technical education, job training, social connections, information assistance, legal aid, and other opportunities to settle and grow. Creating a more integrated housing structure to help immigrants succeed and prosper requires re-thinking typical housing models at the unit, building, and neighborhood scales. The new arrival experience often involves group living in a shared space, a.k.a., co-living. Architecturally, many immigrants have larger families living together with multiple generations under one roof. Socially, they share and bond over cultural and domestic collaborative activities: preparing large meals together, eating together, collaborative childcare, and entertainment are far more communal in nature than that of nuclear households. In many cases, these co-living experiences connect individuals together forging a resilient community. Historical precedents. A CO-LIVING MODEL Co-living is not new but rooted in NYC history in the forms of boarding houses, flop houses, single room occupancy (SROs), and extended-stay hotels. These co-living environments defined themselves by shared services and cheaper rent, with some offering meals and housekeeping, targeting demographics ranging from single women, transient seasonal workers, to families. During the 19th and 20th century, these housing arrangements doubled as social networks for new arrivals, thus shaping urban life. The downfall of these stays was due to their unhygienic living conditions, safety hazards defined by new regulations, and a rising real estate market that was unable to support lower-paying population. While these co-living spaces and housing models are no longer available in NYC, immigrants typically settle informally in co-live situations. One bedroom in an apartment might contain four from a single family, with two other such families in the adjacent bedrooms, and even several single renters in the common areas. Cramped and unable to support a comfortable shared living space, such informal co-living is often illegal and undocumented. A formalized and regulated co-living housing model can beneficially address the immigrants’ needs as they settle in New York City. A new co-live housing model can improve the current informal condition by regulating design standards for co-living, creating sharing-friendly spaces with proper quality-of-life, and strengthening immigrants’ housing stability, making them less prone to exploitation from landlords. Meanwhile, there has been a recent resurgence in the co-living housing market brought on by both the emerging sharing-economy and an increasing demand for quality housing. Companies such as Common, WeLive, and Campus have seized this opportunity by re-branding co-living as a cheaper option compared to market-rate rentals. These co-live housing rentals however are still not truly Affordable since they target international transitory professionals, entrepreneurs, and wealthy millennials. However, this trend triggered us to re-think co-living as a housing typology for newly arrived immigrants. We define CO-LIVE as a housing model that provides shared living spaces and integrated resources for newly arrived immigrants in NYC. In the form of a stabilized, community-based, shared living environment, CO-LIVE has the ability to positively address the housing challenges faced by immigrants upon their arrival, while effectively increasing housing unit supply and choices. CO-LIVE DESIGN PRINCIPLES We define CO-LIVE at the unit, building, and neighborhood scales. Design principles include proper dimensions of sharing, flexible use of space, and programming based upon local community’s needs. CO-LIVE provides a variety of spatial experiences by blurring spatial boundaries between ownership versus sharing, while connecting individuals with community. The CO-LIVE suite: 5 sleeping quarters with shared kitchen and dining. A CO-LIVE unit is made of a collection of 4 CO-LIVE suites that share a large common area containing community spaces for cooking, eating, reading, and playing. The CO-LIVE suite contains 4-6 bedrooms with a small shared kitchen and dining area. In this way, the CO-LIVE unit provides a collection of private and shared spaces that offers both a space of retreat and personal connections. Residents share common spaces, such as the kitchen, living and dining areas, while also having their own private bedroom and dedicated bathrooms. The common area is the social hub of the CO-LIVE unit, where residents socialize, collaborate, and learn from one another. A range of suite types flexibly address the various needs of different immigrant populations, composed of 4-6 bedrooms, with no more than 2 people per room – able to serve individuals, couples, and families. The suite would come fully furnished and the utilities would be split between the suite residents. The CO-LIVE unit: 4 CO-LIVE suites sharing one common “co-” space. CO-LIVE BUILDING At the scale of the building, residents share and participate in supportive programming, easing their transition to NYC. The building will be the hub for access to services that support the residents’ arrival experience as they settle. Services include partnering with a local CBO, and providing multipurpose spaces that can be used flexibly for workforce development, daycare, and language lessons. Laundry, mailroom, and outdoor areas help support a healthy lifestyle. The community programming fosters a supportive and empowering environment for the new arrival community. Each CO-LIVE site will have an associated CBO that residents will have access to for resources needed during their early transition. It can be strategically located at the intersection, or within a certain radius of transit and high-immigrant density. Partnerships with anchor CBO’s will help identify key sites for purchase given their knowledge of the neighborhood, and resident needs. At the building scale, low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise building typologies can offer their own unique experience of CO-LIVE, increasing the amount of shared spaces as the building grows. For instance, at the high-scale scale, a CO-LIVE building will dedicate whole floors to amenities and multi-purpose spaces.There is also opportunity to cross subsidize affordable CO-LIVE units with serviced apartments, and market rate co-live at a larger scale. The Co-Live Building: Low Rise. The Co-Live Building: Mid-Rise. The Co-Live Building: High-Rise. CO-LIVE NEIGHBORHOOD At the scale of the neighborhood, each CO-LIVE site will have an associated CBO that residents will have access to for resources needed during their early transition. It can be strategically located at the intersection, or within a certain radius of transit and high-immigrant density. Partnerships with anchor CBO’s will help identify key sites for purchase given their knowledge of the neighborhood, and resident needs. Beyond their immediate community, they will have access to a virtual portal that connects all CO-LIVE residents citywide. This virtual network will increase awareness of resources, events, as well as provide a broader support network for residents. The Co-Live Neighborhood. CO-LIVE CASE STUDY CHHAYA + RICHMOND HILL, QUEENS PROPOSAL To demonstrate CO-LIVE as a case study, we partnered with Chhaya Community Development Corporation (Chhaya for short) – a community based organization in Jackson Heights, Queens. Chhaya provides services to the South Asian community in Queens including “free direct services, education and outreach, community organizing, and research and policy, as well as both local and citywide coalition-building.” Focusing on the core areas of housing and economic development, their mission aligns with the concept of CO-LIVE as it advocates for housing stability, socioeconomic equity, and community sustainability. Chhaya is expanding programs to better serve continuously growing local populations. They are planning on opening a satellite office in Richmond Hill, Queens, addressing the services needed for a high concentration of underserved South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities. Eventually, their goal is to develop a site in the neighborhood for settlement housing, and a multipurpose community center. The challenges of the community include a lack of affordable and safe housing, and inadequate access to public benefits. Thus, we apply CO-LIVE as a potential solution for this neighborhood, providing an alternative housing model integrated with community-led programs and services. PROJECT CONTEXT Chhaya seeks to develop an 11,000 square foot mixed-use community center in Richmond Hill, Queens. The community center will provide social services and educational programs to 2,000 to 5,000 people annually, especially serving the diverse immigrant communities throughout the Richmond Hill-Ozone Park-Woodhaven areas. In addition to providing a space for Chhaya, this center will act as a conduit bringing other non-profit providers to the neighborhood with additional services and expertise. The overarching goal is to provide safe, accessible, multigenerational space, as well as comprehensive services celebrating diverse cultures for South Asian and Indo-Caribbean residents in South Queens. Richmond Hill is a neighborhood located in Queens Community Board 9 that has over 153,200 people (2011-2015 ACS estimates) — over 50 percent of whom are foreign-born. 26% of district residents are Asian American, having increased from 12% due to growth in immigration. South Asians form the majority, including Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, as well as people of Indo-Caribbean descent. The site is located between 132nd and 133rd street, currently owned by the Area Samaj Spiritual Center. Seeking a mutually beneficial partnership, the owner has offered to sell two plots to Chhaya as site for community center and housing development. Currently zoned as R3A, the site is vacant with no permanent structures and surrounded by single to double story family homes. Currently, there are no South Asian community centers in the 10 to 15-mile radius from the site to build social capital for the community members. In working with William Spizak, the Program Director of Chhaya, we have identified the top five needs for programming: 1) Support in navigating social services in healthcare, legal aid, and immigration assistance; 2) Art and cultural activities such as music, crafts, and dance; 3) Career development such as job prep and search; 4) Special programs and services for youth and senior population; 5) Education including computer training, language classes, and counseling in health, child-care, and wellness. Chhaya desires to build at least 30 housing units and a community center with multiple workshop spaces, four counseling offices, a conference room, a learning & technology lab, a multi-purpose auditorium, and a community garden. The Co-Live Case Study. The Co-Live in Richmond Hill, Queens. Co-Live in Richmond Hill, Queens. CONCLUSION Housing is the cornerstone of settlement in that it defines economic activities, social connections, and most essentially, a home. Housing challenges for immigrants during early transition requires rethinking co-living for new arrivals. As a preliminary exploration, CO-LIVE defines design principles at the unit, building, and neighborhood scale to create a collaborative housing environment integrated with community services. Admittedly, there are barriers from current zoning ordinance and building regulation. Thus, we consider CO-LIVE can be further validated and achieved through combined efforts from bottom-up neighborhood CBO participation and top-down policy support. As a sanctuary city, NYC is facing challenges of increasing population, scarcity of space, and socioeconomic inequity. Meanwhile as a creative city, it continuously embraces emerging opportunities of shared economy, innovative policy, and civic technology. These challenges and opportunities urge architects, planners, designers, and policy-makers to make CO-LIVE possible by defining principles, creating guidelines, breaking down the policy barrier, and engaging with the immigrant communities.

As a child of immigrants, I heard stories from my mother and father, aunties and uncles, about the trauma of leaving their home country, their struggles in pushing roots deep in a new city, and making a home that is not their own their land. Many of them, including my parents, settled in cities, an ecosystem that did not necessarily welcome them with open arms, but tolerated them enough for them to build a life. Now, cities have become sites of conflict and displacement for immigrants, layering their trauma of arrival with an additional fear of displacement. Without this point of arrival, immigrants are left vulnerable and in a tenuous position, unable to build the life they envision for themselves and their families. Cities can design for arrival by rethinking the processes that lead to displacement, and reexamining the processes of community planning across the City. East New York, Brooklyn. There is no place more suitable to understand this than in East New York, a neighborhood that has one of the largest footprints of public space in the form of the Broadway Junction subway station, as well as a population that includes 30.7% foreign born, a 17.1% increase in that population from 2000-2011 (The Newest New Yorkers, 2013). This paper will focus on how immigrants can shape the planning processes around them to ensure that they can remain in place, facilitating the opportunity for immigrants to build roots and maintain their communities. Using the current situation in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn as a case study, I will identify key pressure points and opportunities to include immigrants in the planning processes currently at play in neighborhoods across New York City, and to envision a new way of working between city agencies, residents, and stakeholders that is inclusive of all. WHAT’S GOING ON? On a Saturday morning in a church in East New York, I watched as community based organizations (CBOs) sliced oranges, set up Wi-Fi networks, and arranged tables and chairs. Residents filtered in, along with additional CBO partners holding poster paper and sandwiches. Leaders folded t-shirts that had drawings of individuals holding signs that said “East New York is not for sale”. Mothers brought their children, and guided them towards the back of the church, where there was a table set up for coloring, activities, and adult supervision. Organizers walked around hurriedly as they realized that the church manager had left without giving them the instructions on how to connect to the Wi-Fi. A volunteer hung a banner on the wall saying “Coalition for the Advancement of East New York”. Catherine Green, head of Arts East New York, a key organization for the Coalition for the Advancement of East New York, began the meeting. She discussed why this was an urgent meeting: the NYC Economic Development Corporation a quasi-governmental had reached out to her. An advisory group was being formed, and EDC was convening them. They wanted to understand what the residents’ needs were in East New York and Cypress Hills in regards to Broadway Junction. As part of the EDC advisory group, she wanted to hear the needs of the residents. She was followed by speeches from key leaders from Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation, the local YMCA, and other institutions, all of whom emphasized that this was an opportunity for everyone around the room, and that the improvements in the neighborhood should be what they all have been asking for years, not what a city agency thinks they need. One speaker said, now is the time to organize, stay committed, and stay focused on the asks and the needs the community has been hungry for decades. After a couple of more speakers, and a screening of a section of the movie “My Brooklyn”, which showed the policies and practices employed by EDC and private developers for downtown Brooklyn, another leader talked about the historical processes that have been in place for decades that have resulted in East New York and Cypress Hills being disinvested in, ignored, and forgotten for so long. They talked about redlining, the effect of racist policies in denying family and individuals of color mortgages to purchase their homes. HOW DID WE GET HERE? Much has been written about the processes and failures of the rezoning of East New York. As it was the first rezoning triggered by the Mayor’s Housing Plan, the city struggled to figure out how to balance the needs and the mandate of the mayor to increase the number of units of affordable housing across the city, while also engaging with a community that has been largely ignored. Add that on to the fact that the city had been previously engaging with the community leading up to the rezoning via the Verde Summit (on the community side) and the Sustainable Communities study (on the city side), and the result was a relationship that many involved have labeled as a “complete 180 shift in priorities”. WHAT’S AT STAKE Broadway Junction, the site in question, is a transit hub where 3.2 million New Yorkers transfer between the Z, M, J, L, A and C lines. The intense congestion at the train station is compounded by the five buses at street level, as well as the Long Island Railroad one block away. This station is hardly commuter, resident, or pedestrian friendly: walks around in and into the station result in multiple dead ends into MTA parking lots, equipment storage area. Station hubs of this size and traffic, like Union Square, have much of the subway below ground, while the majority of Broadway Junction is above ground. An analysis of major transit hubs in NYC highlights that Broadway Junction is one that was heavily populated and used, as well as being located in a neighborhood that has a large number of immigrants. The most recent Newest New Yorker Report shows that in East New York, 30.7% of the population is foreign born, as well as an increase in the foreign born population 2000-2011 of 17.1%. The Broadway Junction study, grounded in the East New York neighborhood, has the potential to support numerous immigrants to stay in place. REFLECTIONS Regardless of the direction or attitude, what is clear is that the power has, and continues to lie in the hands of city agencies. Whether it be the Department of City Planning, the Economic Development Corporation, the Parks Department, or private developers, space and public space are owned, controlled by, and shaped by non-residents of the neighborhoods in New York City. The majority of this statement lies in the fact that city agencies and private developers have the means to hire planners, designers and architects, individuals who understand both the language of space and place, but also individuals who are trained in the ways of regulations, approvals and certifications to get things built, renovated, removed, and rehabbed in the neighborhood. What was described at the beginning of this paper was the attempt of community based organizations, organizations who are not trained in, nor paid to do design and planning work, to do design and planning work. Having these CBOs who are already stretched so thin to do the work of organizing residents AND gathering information about residents needs and desires AND collecting, collating and presenting it to EDC and DCP is a significant amount of work for CBOs who are well versed in meeting facilitation and organizing, but are not in urban planning, design and architecture, to advise EDC on the needs of Broadway Junction, is a request that is a lot to ask. Although CBOs have, and continue to rise to the challenge (see Sheridan Expressway, and diversion of Waste Transfer Stations), a better way is possible. RETHINKING POSSIBILITIES: A PARADIGM SHIFT Recommendation 1 (ongoing): Create a Master Plan for New York City. 197a plans are a tool, but have rarely been used as a tool for effective community planning in New York City. And if they have been used, they have rarely been implemented. Although New York City currently has a housing plan, this leaves out a clear vision for the city, the borough and the neighborhoods. A clear master plan for New York City will allow residents to understand the city’s vision for their neighborhood in a clear way and it will allow Community Planners to have a guiding document for which they can orient their work towards. Recommendation 2 (Immediate Term): Create a Planning Help Desk in each borough. New York City currently has a Zoning Help Desk, facilitated by Department of City Planning, which allows residents, developers, other city agencies and stakeholder to call in with specific zoning questions. The same can be created with a focus on planning at large, rather than just zoning. Recommendation 3 (short term): Create a Community Planner Position in each borough. This proposal was inspired by the model of the public defenders office: an office, supported by the City, in which a government appointed lawyer is appointed for those appearing before court who do not have the means to pay for a lawyer. Although they are employees of the government, they are required to operate with the plaintiffs best interest in mind. What would it look like if we had a similar role for planners? This would ensure that residents would have a planner, well versed in the language of planning and design, that is thinking about the residents (not the city’s) best interest. A role like this could be phased in over time: each borough could start with a single community planner. With time, that single community planner for each borough could evolve into a team of urban planners, utilizing the Zone Model pioneered by NYCHA REES department, and can culminate, over time, in a planner for each borough. This allows for a knowledgeable, individual, trained in planning, to serve communities in question, to remove the burden from CBO’s, and to foster the opportunity for a real conversation in co-creating public spaces, neighborhoods, and cities that work for all.

Kate Larsen ▷ Memory and Design Language in Establishing a Home Posted on April 17, 2018 “Through dreams, the various dwelling-places in our lives co-penetrate and retain treasures of former days.”1 **** In his novel Open City, author Teju Cole, a Nigerian immigrant himself, tells the story of a young Nigerian doctor who walks the streets of New York City to unwind after the work day, observing the minutia of the city around him, reflecting on past experiences and life in Nigeria, and winding his way back to his apartment on the subway when he has wandered too far. Throughout the book, the city’s landscape evokes fleeting memories and sensorial connections to life in another country; he writes about these moments poetically: The following day, returning to Sheep Meadow, on a circuitous route to a poetry reading at the Ninety-second Street Y, I noticed the masses of leaves dying off in bright colors, and heard the white-throated sparrows within them calling out and listening. It had rained earlier, and the fragmented, light-filled clouds worked off each other; maples and elms stood with their boughs still. Above a boxwood hedge, the swarm of hovering bees reminded me of certain Yoriba epithets for Olodumare, the supreme deity: he who turns blood into children, who sits in the sky like a cloud of bees.2 It is not a journey with a point A and a point B that Cole describes, but rather an intricately woven series of loops through the city infrastructure and a corresponding emotional journey as the protagonist seeks to establish his identity within his life and a new country. He says, “It was this way, at the beginning of the final year of my psychiatry fellowship, New York City worked itself into my life at walking pace.”3 The experience of landscape is a sensory, evocative, and emotional human experience on a conscious and unconscious level. The second we leave our houses, we experience weather, light and shadow, the materials of the path beneath our feet. We may travel the same routes again and again over the course of our days, familiarizing ourselves with that path – the street trees, the bench at a bus stop, the metal handle on the door to the subway station – or we may deviate from the pattern, seeking new routes, visiting a park to relax, attending an event in a plaza, or simply taking an alternate route to work; all the while, we are immersing ourselves in the built environment around us. New York City works itself into our lives at walking pace. When we leave a city and immigrate to a new one, this pattern begins anew. For a newcomer to New York, this is the way it can become a home. **** Every immigrant has his or her own history, a personal sense of home, and a lifetime of memories and associations with various places he or she has been. There is a spectrum of emotions, undoubtedly, that comes with moving to a new country and encountering not just a new residence, but also facing economic challenges, cultural and language differences, and an unfriendly political climate. This spectrum is directly tied to an individual’s history and circumstance. Case Study: Broadway Junction. Designers must familiarize themselves with the landscapes with which immigrant communities may be familiar as a starting point for establishing a common language. That said, it is possible to trace trends and draw some conclusions, and it is important to look to studies that do so when beginning to discuss how best cities can serve immigrant communities, particularly public spaces that are required to serve many individuals and many groups at once. A 2004 study of how immigrants use Boston area parks describes many of the immigrants surveyed as: …struggling to adapt to a new society in which they feel marginalized by language and cultural differences and at risk due to uncertainties around employment, education, and housing. It is in this context that people use public open spaces to gather in ways that remind them of their home country. In these spaces, they can meet friends and family facing similar challenges and offer one another advice and support.4 Design of public spaces is therefore an incredible opportunity to create a sense of belonging by weaving together these dreams of past, present, and future. “Put another way, the ‘where’ of our sensory experiences in the world have a profound influence on our ability to create individual and collective identities — to become, know, and name who we are…”5 This project asks: because of the sensory power of place and landscape, can a designer have a unique role in the process of Designing for Arrival? And with that, how does a designer, often from outside of the community, design places that are evocative for individuals and for groups who may be coming from vastly different backgrounds? **** The only possible way to establish a design language that speaks to another’s experience, of course, is through dialogue, and there are immediate challenges in these conversations. For example, a public space design project is likely structured such that the immigrant community in question is the end user, but not necessarily the client. This means, then, that proper collaboration between the client, designer, and end users must be fostered. Within this collaboration, then, there are challenges that are particular to working with immigrant populations, such as language and cultural barriers. We are fortunate in New York that there are several groups working to create various resources for breaking down these barriers, such as the People Make Parks project by Hester Street Collaborative and Partnership for Parks, which uses a series of games and interactive tools to engage community members and park users, and the Partnership for Parks “Guide to Immigrant Outreach in Parks,” which is a series of recommendations directed at parks groups for fostering participation among nearby immigrant populations. Once dialogue is established, there is a final hurdle, which is that designers also often speak a language particular to the profession. It is often easier to have conversations about how many bathrooms a park needs or about how the lights at the ball field are broken or about how the park should support a diversity of activities reflective of the diversity in the neighborhood. It can be more difficult to have a conversation about the more visceral qualities of landscape such as light and shadow, the sound of wind in certain tree canopies, the warmth of certain materials, or the narrative of a path unfolding before you and how that feels different when it is lined with trees versus a tall hedge versus adjacent to an open field, simply because these may are often things experienced but not articulated. It is particularly challenging when the designer and the immigrant communities aren’t necessarily familiar with same landscapes and therefore don’t share common references. **** Design is a visual discipline, and the process often begins by gathering images – precedents of other projects that might have applicable characteristics that might be useful as part of the design. It is these images that allow designers to talk to one another – and clients – and to have conversations from which design is born. Typically a design project looks to geographically proximate projects as precedents, projects that might be similar in size or program. This project proposes that a designer should, in whatever way possible, examine precedents from the countries of origin as a starting point for a conversation about visual language. Two contemporary examples of this design methodology are Rios Clementi Hale’s Grand Park in Los Angeles and BIG, Topotek1, and Superflex’s Superkilen in Norrebro, Copenhagen. These are notable as well given that the design was based in research and conversation, but the ways in which that was translated into visual language are very different. Case Study: Broadway Junction. Through conversation and gathering visual precedents, surprising and meaningful interpretations may be found. Grand Park, a civic public space in the heart of downtown LA, bills itself as “The Park for Everyone” and found its design language through the examination of the flora of the countries of origin to find overlaps with plants that would be appropriate for the southern California climate. The designers established a planting palette of native and exotic plants that would be representative of the diverse cultural makeup of the city. Signage throughout the park explains gives context to the plant design. Additionally, in this study, they noticed that of all of the flowers in the origin countries, there was only one color that was common to all: hot pink. The custom furniture throughout the site is finished in that exact hue, a sly nod to the precedent study. The designers of Superkilen took a different tactic. Home to more than 60 nationalities, Norrebro is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Copenhagen. The community outreach took a quite extensive and hands on approach: five groups of different community members took trips all over the world, following particular memories of people from the neighborhood in order to find and source specific objects. These were either transported directly to the site or a replica was made. Each is displayed with a plate adjacent describing the object and a story on an online app that explains the origin of the item. It is, in effect, an outdoor museum of internationalism, placing representative objects on display and celebrating the stories of their origins. The juxtaposition of the different objects, out of their original context, creates new meaning for a new place. **** …a designer who wants to make a home that can be loved cannot simply tabulate a list of physical features that have been shown to be pleasing to the human perceptual apparatus. The design must understand the client’s history, the kinds of dwellings that they have known so far, and the kinds of things that happened to them in these places of memory.6 **** This is not to say that there is one “right” outcome to these conversations. Nor is it to advocate for replication or appropriation as a design solution. Rather, it is to suggest that there is something magical in learning about the landscapes and public spaces of the countries of origin. Using this understanding while designing will yield a result that is meaningful and possibly surprising. Designers play a unique role by being able to help facilitate dialogue about visceral experiences in the built environment. Let’s change the typical conversation. This is not to say that there is one “right” outcome to these conversations. Nor is it to advocate for replication or appropriation as a design solution. Rather, it is to suggest that there is something magical in learning about the landscapes and public spaces of the countries of origin. Using this understanding while designing will yield a result that is meaningful and possibly surprising. The aforementioned examples are vibrant, visually striking, gathering spaces that have been researched with respect to the users’ history. It could be argued, however, that some aspects are more successful than others, particularly as we return to discussing the more visceral aspects of designing for arrival. For example, the use of plant material Grant Park would certainly be reminiscent of the textures, colors, smells, and shadows that a newcomer might remember, but a pink bench is not necessarily evocative of the flowers it represents unless you know the story behind it. Collecting objects from various countries and gathering them in Copenhagen acts as a reference to a specific place and time, but can also be seen as a reduction of a culture into a symbol and an exoticization of an object, rather than a meaningful gesture toward an immigrant population. This is not simply to criticize, but to say that perhaps this methodology could be furthered with ongoing conversation and adaptive responses even after construction. In conclusion, we need to keep talking. And in these conversations, we cannot lose sight of the unique position that the designer brings — a means to establish a design language in order to design for memory, design for the senses, design for arrival. We also cannot lose sight of the larger goal of equity in public space design and the goal of establishing systems that can both benefit and benefit from immigrant communities. Park and public space design and the designer’s role in the process is simply a single piece in a vibrant network of civic, economic, and political systems that allows our city to serve all people.

IN CONVERSATION WITH: Julia Lindgren, Hester Street Collaborative Sarita Daftary-Steel, East New York resident and board member of United Community Centers Daphne Lundi ▷ Inbetweeners: Young Adults, Immigrants and Public Spaces Posted on April 17, 2018 How we use public space is personal. Where we decide to sit, play, and congregate, is largely driven by how a space makes us feel and whether we feel welcome. Creating inclusive public spaces means designing spaces that meet the needs of a variety of people. New York City has world class public spaces, but do they meet the needs of all users? What about young adults, those who’ve outgrown playgrounds but aren’t necessarily welcomed in all spaces? How are public spaces serving them, and how does immigration complicate notions of accessible public space? We know that New York City is a city of immigrants, but we often don’t think about the fact that New York is a city of young immigrants. Over a third of New Yorkers are immigrants and just under a half,1 or 45%, of New York City’s foreign-born population is between the ages of 18-45.2 In addition, there are approximately 73,000 New Yorkers who are DACA recipients or DACA-eligible.3 New York also has a significant number of young immigrants who enter the country alone. In 2013, there was an estimated 58,000 undocumented minors living in New York State, second only to Texas. And yet, even though young adults represent a significant portion of the City’s population, it’s hard to think of public spaces that cater to them. The way we typically understand immigration and the politics of public space becomes complicated when we consider the needs of young adults. Spatially, teenagers are primarily allowed to occupy educational facilities and their place of residence.4 Yet, both spaces are likely highly regulated. In addition, a newly arrived immigrant may be in a crowded living situation or might have challenges accessing school because of documentation issues.1 Several school districts in the New York metropolitan area have school requirements that include showing an original birth certificate, state identification, or immigration paperwork in order to register a minor for school.5 These requirements can make navigating the school system more challenging as an undocumented minor or the child of undocumented parents. Public spaces become all the more important in this context because they are often spaces of freedom and personal growth. Unlike navigating housing, school, or other regulated spaces that might require documentation, or have certain culturally or socially specific mores, public spaces like parks, sidewalk benches, and plazas don’t require those formalities. For the most part, public spaces are what we make of them, they’re the quintessential “third place”.6 For most young people, regardless of immigration status, having a third place to shape identity is critical. These are the spaces where they can encounter other young adults from a variety of backgrounds who might challenge or reaffirm ideas of self.7 They are also spaces where social bounds can be developed and strengthened, and where critical social infrastructure can be formed. The magic of these spaces is that this infrastructure is developed without adult supervision and without having to spend capital. Unfortunately it can be challenging to linger in public spaces because of design choices or the policing of space, particularly for youth of color and undocumented youth. If we reflect back on the history of Broken Windows and Stop and Frisk, most of the policing was built on targeting people perceived as more likely to commit criminal behavior. According the Vera Institute of Justice, at the height of Stop and Frisk policy in the early 2010’s, roughly half of all stops involved individuals between the ages of 13 and 25.8 These stops occurred in public spaces like parks and sidewalks. At the same time, other types of third spaces, like shopping malls, aren’t necessarily welcoming to large groups of young people. In 2010, the Atlantic Terminal Mall in Downtown Brooklyn enacted new policy that forbade groups of 4 or more people under the age of 21 from lingering in the mall.9 While the policy was enacted in a private space, and was ostensibly put in place to deter large groups from overwhelming stores, it also points to the way in which the operators of private spaces likes malls or fast food restaurants—traditional third spaces for young people—still have the legal right to exclude certain demographics. As an urban planner, native New Yorker, and the child of immigrants, I’ve spent a lot of my life and career in exercises of translations: trying to make complex ideas, be it zoning, land use, or run of the mill information, accessible. When thinking through these complex issues of public space, I wanted engage with young people living through the tensions. I had the opportunity to talk to teenagers at Grover Cleveland HS in Ridgewood currently thinking through the challenges of immigration. The class was working in partnership with Y-PLAN (Youth – Plan, Learn, Act, Now) a national program that allows young adults to pitch design/policy solutions to local government. The students were working on creating apps to help NYC immigrant’s access job and housing resources as well as provide general advice on navigating the City. The class was predominately first generation and second generation immigrants from Latin America, South Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Students at Grover Cleveland High School mapping out welcoming vs unwelcoming spaces. We spent the class discussing their experiences in public space and how they would make spaces more accessible for young people, especially young immigrants. We did a mapping exercise using their high school and the surrounding area to map out safe and welcoming spaces, versus spaces they felt excluded. Even though their school is next to a park, many students highlighted the space as being unwelcoming, in some cases because of its proximity to the school, or because there was not much for them to do in the park. Oftentimes, non-public spaces like restaurant parking lots were highlighted as good public spaces because they allowed for social gathering without being under the surveillance of school. Map of welcoming vs unwelcoming spaces. When I asked the students how they would change spaces to make them more accessible, most of their recommendations centered around improving the accessibility of public spaces: whether through translation so that newly arrived young people know about the history of public spaces, through community gatherings where neighbors can share food to learn about each other, or through the creation of social networking apps, where young people can connect to teenagers with similar interests who live in their neighborhood to meet up in public spaces. The students’ recommendations and experiences in public spaces point to a need for creating more points of entry into the planning and design process for young people. While the planning and design profession has many tools for community engagement, there remains a significant “blindspot” in architecture and planning when it comes to teenagers.4 City of Oslo Traffic Agent App. There are examples of successful local and international youth engagement around public space planning. In 2006, the Sara D. Roosevelt Park Coalition worked with People Make Parks to conduct a community planning process for Sara D. Roosevelt Park, an eight acre park at the intersections of Chinatown and the Lower East Side. The park’s user base reflects this confluence of neighborhoods with kids and adults playing handball and basketball, and seniors doing Tai Chi in the early morning. People for Parks put on a day-long visioning event, gathering feedback from 600 young people. There was a variety of ways to participate (scavenger hunt -site surveying, adult and teen design charrettes, model making, etc.) and provide feedback in a variety of formats and languages.10 The City of Oslo, funded an app for grade school children that allows them to provide feedback on pedestrian and traffic conditions on their way to school.11 Making sure that community engagement processes foster co-creation for a variety of participants and creating more mobile-friendly tools can go a long way in allowing young people to voice their opinions about public spaces. If a young person is the intended user of a space, they should be involved in the design process. Many city agencies like the School Construction Authority, Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Department of Transportation, spend a significant amount of their capital budgets on the construction and rehabilitation of spaces that will likely be occupied by young people. Oftentimes there is a community engagement component that accompanies these capital projects, but because the demographics of civic groups and community boards, the residents involved in community engagement activities may not reflect the current demographics of immigrant communities or a diversity in age.12 As urban planners and designers, we should strive to create community engagement practices that include the voices of people who aren’t just the usual suspects when it comes to engagement. We should be creating more lines of communication for people who can’t attend a town hall event or a working group meeting. Creating partnerships with local middle school and high schools can be an innovative way to include more young voices in the planning and design process, and also introduce more young people to the urban planning and urban design, both professions which have traditionally lacked diverse representation.13 High school students are typically required to take some sort of civics course before graduation, but it’s unlikely that the class touches on urban planning policy, even though government plays a significant role in shaping the built environment. There are so many decisions that go into shaping the built environment, but if you’re a young person or an immigrant, the decision-making process can seem abstruse and inaccessible. In communities undergoing major planning processes that include investments in public space, the creation of a youth advisory groups at a local area schools or partnering with a civics or government class, can be an effective way to get more young voices in the planning process, and also introduce more young people to planning and urban design. It can also be a way to get older immigrants involved in planning. A working adult may not have time to go to a public meeting about a park, but if their children are actively involved in the planning and design process they then have access to all the latest news. We can also create more interactive and mobile friendly community engagement platforms. According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 73% of teens have access to smartphones.14 As we work on creating more inclusive community engagement approaches, special attention should be given to web and mobile platforms that make it easier to provide feedback, particularly for residents who may not feel safe in engaging with government through more formal channels. Signage can go a long way in creating a sense of ownership and invitation into public spaces. Traditional NYC Parks Signage creates a sense of consistency and wayfinding when it comes to open space, but what if there was a way to celebrate these spaces and make their uses clearer to immigrants? We should encourage more signage that welcomes immigrants into public spaces and that encourages joy in public spaces. Lastly we have to become more comfortable with young people occupying and shaping public spaces. Lingering in a public space is not loitering, and frankly we should rethink the definition of loitering as a whole. The Yes Loitering Project is a collective of teenagers in the South Bronx who spent 2017 collecting extensive research teenagers’ feelings on policing, street harassment, and accessibility of public space.15 In general many of the teens felt like there aren’t welcoming spaces for teenagers and far too often, they’re even criminalized in public space. As a planner, I think about the lifetime of planning decisions. Oftentimes when we design a public space or facilitate a zoning action, the outcomes of those decisions won’t be fully realized for several years or even decades. Young people are the ones that get to experience the final product of our decisions. As such, they should be involved in shaping the decision making process. For young immigrants, and young people in general, having agency in public space is all the more important: public spaces can be important sanctuary spaces outside the watchful eye of family members and institutions, and they are the spaces where identity, friendships, and social networks are formed and nurtured.

Nse Esema ▷ Jonathan Goldman ▷ Matthew McMahon ▷ A Toolkit to Spatialize Immigrant Experiences Posted on April 17, 2018 INTRODUCTION Immigration is typically understood at distinct scales: the global, the multinational, the national, and the local. At the global scale, the number of international migrants worldwide reached 258 million in 2017, an increase of almost 50% since 2000,1 driven by the pull of unequal economic and social opportunities across borders, and the push of natural disasters and political upheavals. At the multinational scale, flows of people from the Middle East and North Africa into Europe has had profound effects on the relationships between European nations. At the national scale, debates over immigration have featured prominently in recent public discourse in the United States, with over 25 percent of respondents to a major poll listing immigration as one of the top five problems for the government to address in 2017.2 At the local scale, there are sanctuary cities and immigrant neighborhoods, as well as local examples of xenophobia. These scales of understanding the phenomenon of immigration in turn informs the scales of responses: United Nations resolutions, multilateral treaties, national laws, local policies. However, key dynamics of immigration are best understood in a regional context. The American Planning Association defines a region as “a geographic area that transcends the boundaries of individual governmental units but that shares common social, economic, political, cultural, and natural resources, and transportation characteristics.”3 A regional consideration of immigration is increasingly important in the United States, as immigrants are now less likely to be concentrated within a particular urban core: the proportion of immigrants living in suburbs grew from 56 percent in 2000 to 61 percent in 2013, and three-quarters of immigrant population growth in that period occurred in the suburbs.4 Immigrant dispersion and suburbanization presents new challenges, as immigrants may be less likely to form critical masses for social support and political power, and small municipalities may be less capable to address immigrant needs. Furthermore, trends related to the movement of people, goods, and information across large distances call into question whether a region must necessarily be contiguous. With decreasing costs for air travel, some immigrants with the means make regular visits to their countries of origins; for many, instant phone or electronic communication is a daily part of life. With the intergenerational clustering of immigrants with a shared origin, specific multimodal connections occur, as in the case of northern Puebla, Mexico and Newburgh, New York: the relationship has led La Noria, Puebla to be nicknamed “Noria York,” and Newburgh, the “other Puebla York” (the first being New York City, no longer the sole major destination for immigrants).5 Even more strikingly, financial connections between immigrants and countries of origin bring distant localities into close economic interdependencies, with almost $140 billion in remittances flowing from immigrants in the US to origin countries in 2016 alone.6 To define an appropriate region, and to understand that region from immigrants’ perspectives, traditional, authoritative data sources are not sufficient. Past generations of planners have articulated the need to have direct communications with individuals and communities affected by plans, especially for groups that are typically underrepresented. This principle applies especially to immigrants, whose familiarity with their new homes, lack of proficiency in the local language, and legal status may all lead them to be underrepresented to those with the authority to collect, publish, and use major data sources. TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS OF PLANNING REGIONS Public planners operate within specific jurisdictional boundaries. For instance, city planners for New York City exert their influence over the five boroughs: looking at housing availability, the distribution of public space, where to expand and improve transit, and the like. However, a planner’s agency largely ends at the borough boundaries. The resulting policy, guidelines, statutes, mappings, and other products of planning draw their power from the political structure standing behind them, yet begin and end at their jurisdictional edges. While this system works quite well for planning issues whose scope can be managed at a single jurisdictional level, the division of planning authority by governmental body encounters challenges when it becomes tasked with issues that cross political boundaries. The limits of this structure may be best evidenced by strategies developed by ecological science and environmentalist critiques. Watersheds, habitat corridors, contaminant clean-up, scenic regions, and climate change all defy political boundaries and demand coordinated planning approaches at multiple levels and across multiple territories. Not fitting neatly within political territories, intergovernmental agreements or non-governmental advocacy groups form to address a given issue. Similar to these environmentally determined planning boundaries, some cities have established planning bodies that reconsider the historical artifacts of their political boundaries, in effect redrawing the map to allow for a more holistic approach to the issues they face. Portland, for example, established an overlay regional district occupying the jurisdictional space between county and state levels that encompasses portions of three counties and twenty three cities to manage the growth of urban areas and preservation of open space in the Portland metropolitan region.7 The boundary is under the jurisdiction of elected officials and is understood to be the only political entity of its kind in the country. The Regional Plan Association (RPA) studies and advocates for policies in the metropolitan region of New York City, drawing in multiple states, counties, and cities to address issues that defy historical jurisdictional boundaries. However, unlike Metro, the RPA is not an elected government body and does not have any official authority. As a group of Urban Design Forum Forefront Fellows focused on the intersection of regional planning and contemporary immigration, we take inspiration from the above examples of freeing issues from the political boundaries they are set within. CROSS-BOUNDARY LIVING Many people live their lives across political boundaries, living in one municipality, working in a different county, and worshiping in a third state. Access to key services, including but not limited to reliable transportation and secure housing typically enable cross-boundary living; simultaneously, cross-boundary living can also provide access to these same services, creating a virtuous feedback cycle. For some traditionally marginalized groups, such as immigrants, this loop can be vicious. Living life in a way that crosses political boundaries can surface challenges and require circumnavigation that are not typically considered by mainstream planning actors. This is especially true for immigrants who are poor, undocumented and/or have limited English language abilities. For example, consider a newly arrived undocumented immigrant who lives in a neighborhood of a suburban town that is miles away from New York City. Their housing choices are limited by their economic circumstances. But living in a far flung suburban town could make it challenging to access a job in NYC or another commercial node where there is a greater likelihood of finding a job, especially one that doesn’t require formal work authorization. Specifically, the sprawled layout of their suburb could make the last mile journey from a transit station to their home especially challenging as the immigrant balances not being able to drive legally with very limited local bus services. These are challenges that planners can help alleviate. While planners’ and designers’ influence on federal policy like immigration reform is typically limited, it is squarely within our remit to shift the ways local and regional public services reinforce limitations or create opportunities for marginalized communities. PROPOSAL FOR IMMIGRANT ENGAGEMENT Our proposal consists of the following elements: 1. Develop mapping strategies that help redefine regional boundaries from immigrants’ perspectives and identify immigrants’ priorities and needs. 2. Engage immigrant communities through formal planning groups throughout the New York City region. This should begin with one group for each of New York City’s five boroughs. The attached Toolkit for Immigrant Engagement is an initial attempt to define an engagement process that can support the creation of policies, plans, designs and proposals that improve the lives of immigrants. At an individual level, these spatial extents comprise a particular immigrant’s zone of influence. Our hypothesis is that when the extents of multiple individuals living in a particular community with a defining characteristic (e.g., undocumented and poor) are merged, the aggregate extent could suggest a version of a region’s boundaries from that immigrant community’s perspective. Institutions like the RPA, which already grasp the fundamental idea that people live in ways that defy administrative and political boundaries and are committed to improving life for those across the region, are well situated to pioneer methods for querying and understanding these non-traditional boundaries. In the development of their Fourth Regional Plan, the RPA engaged in formal contractual relationships with community organizations in order to ensure that the plan appropriately reflected the perspectives of communities whose voices are often unheard. One reflection of community groups participating in the process and RPA staff was that there are some issues that are very important to immigrant communities but are not traditionally considered planning issues. The group struggled with the best way to integrate these critical issues into the Fourth Regional Plan. For example, while the planning process readily engages with questions of where new transit routes might need to be built, it is traditionally less involved with questions of how quickly fare prices increase or the discrimination experienced by passengers on local bus routes. Creating the opportunity for immigrants to map their own experiences of navigating the region could help make space for some of these issues that are not always considered in planning processes. Organizations that support immigrant communities could also benefit from a visualization of immigrant communities’ boundaries because it might help them to understand, communicate and/or advocate for the true spatial reach required of their work. Citing scholars and immigrant advocates, a NYTimes article published in March 2017 noted, “the kinds of services that immigrants rely on– low-cost legal help, language classes, interpretation and public transportation– have not kept pace with demand and remain disproportionately concentrated in big cities.” Mapping what immigrant communities’ current zones of influence look like, and the ways that may be limited by access to affordable transport options, affordable housing, and existing services can help trigger public, targeted responses to improve these same services- potentially expanding what those zones of influence look like.

Mariane Jang ▷ Lakshman Kalasapudi ▷ Eliza Montgomery ▷ Audrey Wachs ▷ Designing for Integration in Jamaica, Queens Posted on April 17, 2018 “Social infrastructure is the interdependent mix of facilities, places, spaces, programs, projects, services and networks that maintain and improve the standard of living and quality of life in a community.” (Department of Planning Western Australia, 2012) In studying Jamaica, Queens and the needs of its immigrant populations, we found early on that a clear and widely accepted single definition of ‘social infrastructure’ does not exist. A quick Google search gives a broad range of definitions that focus on physical infrastructure, communication, or information sharing networks. When considering the real needs of immigrants, however, we found it was more valuable to focus on resources that might foster greater social cohesion, rather than on physical infrastructure. Infrastructure connotes images of bridges and roads, but infrastructure isn’t just what fills physical spaces. Rather, there is a conceptual distinction between “place” and “space”—place is any physical area where social interactions happen, and space is a “practiced place,” one that’s richer, thicker, and more layered with meaning because of the humans that shape it and dwell within it. Social infrastructure undergirds what Canadian journalist Doug Saunders calls the “arrival city.” In his view, arrival cities are spaces where new migrants can build social connections that allow them to access employment and housing, build their own businesses, and interact with other immigrants in similar circumstances to form networks that enable individuals to establish a secure foothold in a new city. In other words, an arrival city is one that promotes strong social cohesion between its diverse residents and communities, supports a rich multicultural society, and enables immigrants to thrive. These cities also allow new immigrants participate on equal footing in social, economic and political life, develop relationships of trust with others and institutions, and have access to opportunity for social mobility.1 In thinking about innovative approaches to providing social infrastructure for integration, our team posed two main questions: What are the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City? In those neighborhoods, what social infrastructure exists to promote social cohesion, and what could be improved? After some deliberation, we chose to engage these questions through Jamaica, Queens, an ethnically diverse neighborhood in the city’s most diverse borough. While a high cost of living and increasingly punitive federal immigration laws place tremendous stress on the city’s emerging and established immigrant communities alike, the positive frisson that characterizes arrival cities certainly describes Jamaica, a place where more than half of residents hail from outside the U.S. Chart depicting the demographic breakdown of our study area in Jamaica, Queens. Within our study area, the largest foreign-born groups include the Guayanese, Bangladeshi, Ecuadoreans, El Salvadoreans and Guatemalans, and there are more second-generation residents, and residents whose parents settled in the United States many decades ago. Jamaica is a large neighborhood with overlapping constituencies, so we chose to analyze the demographics of a roughly two-mile-long stretch of Jamaica Avenue, a main neighborhood shopping street and the site of most of Jamaica’s LinkNYC kiosks. In that area, 60 percent of the approximately 50,000 residents identify as immigrants (foreign-born). In addition to being a vital commercial corridor, this segment of Jamaica Avenue connects residents to the other four boroughs, greater New York, and beyond, via bus, subway, commuter rail, and plane, with JFK Airport less than five miles away. These transit options make the neighborhood attractive to outside investment, too. In the coming years, developers intend to add around 2,000 new apartment units and about 1,500 hotel rooms to Downtown Jamaica. It remains to be seen how these developments will affect neighborhood demographics, but there’s a pressing neighborhood need right now: Immigrants can’t always access the neighborhood’s arts and culture resources. In Jamaica, there is an established, well-funded local arts scene, but main players Jamaica Culture Arts & Learning (JCAL) and others focus narrowly on formal aspects of arts culture (visual arts, performing arts such as dance, theatre and music). However, other forms of cultural production in the arts, culture and music that are geared towards new immigrants (for whom English is a second language), younger participants, and others who are not formally trained in the arts are emerging, but are underfunded, uncoordinated, and awareness about these programs is low. In addition, there is a recognition that these resources are not accessible to everyone, including many of Jamaica’s immigrant groups. Through site meetings, interviews with local arts stakeholders, neighborhood tours and local surveys with Nadezhda Williams (Rufus King Park), Brendez Wineglass (Jamaica Is), Tyra Emerson (Cultural Collaborative Jamaica) and a sample of neighborhood residents, we learned that there is a desire from community-based organizations and immigrant groups to find ways to connect through arts and culture.2 Given these factors affecting the neighborhood, our project aims to develop a multi-directional interface in a public setting that will boost social cohesion between seemingly disparate immigrant groups in Jamaica, Queens by enhancing access to neighborhood arts and culture resources. Rendering of the platform interface on a LinkNYC kiosk along Jamaica Avenue. Our project idea is to create a multilingual platform that helps immigrant groups and the community-based organizations that support them access and disseminate information about local arts and cultural resources and events. Partnering with these organizations to initially populate the platform, it would include information about public events such as music festivals, art shows, dance performances and religious events. Eventually we would like to see the users, whether organizations or individuals, not simply consume the information but upload their own events, offers, or requests for resources to grow the platform into useful, widely-used network. While we think this platform could be accessed through diverse formats and vehicles, we are particularly interested in the ubiquitous LinkNYC kiosks that line Jamaica Avenue, as they provide the space for the kind of serendipitous, unmediated interactions that can help build social cohesion, especially among groups that rarely or never interact with one another. Rendering of the platform on a smartphone. Based on these observations, we believe the platform should: • Be geared towards immigrants, but accessible to everyone (including those with limited technological proficiency) • Ensure access to arts and culture for diverse stakeholders • Encourage interactions between different immigrant groups to enhance multicultural appreciation • Utilize the arts and culture to help immigrant groups integrate while retaining their cultural identities • Promote immigrant entrepreneurship as a route to economic integration and prosperity for all city residents • Strengthen and promote community-based organizations, as they are the backbone of immigrant integration efforts • Be accessible on LinkNYC kiosks and as a downloadable smartphone app • Have an easy-to-use interface, especially for those with limited computer proficiency Map of our project area with cultural resources and LinkNYC kiosks highlighted. The platform would be presented with a heavy focus on visual literacy (images and mapping) rather than text, which we hope will help overcome the barrier of poor translation. Organizations could “own” a kiosk and design it or program it in their own way as a way to drive people to use the kiosks. Those with IDNYC identification could obtain discounts to participating events and organizations. In almost every locality, the arts are a means for new immigrants to express themselves in a way that is already familiar to them, in a new city that is far from home, and feel ownership, pride and a sense of agency. Music, art, dance, and cooking are fundamentally social and interactive, creating opportunities for knowledge and information exchange, culture sharing, and forming new acquaintances or relationships, all of which act as a counterpoint to the potential isolation that new immigrants might experience. Engaging in arts and culture could open up opportunities for immigrants to learn another language/culture, develop a business idea, start a new program, or otherwise strengthen ties to others in their ethnic group or beyond. We hope this will be the case in Jamaica. REFERENCES 1. “Perspectives on Social Cohesion – the Glue That Holds Society Together | UN DESA Department of Economic and Social Affairs.” United Nations.

63,Future Living: Possibilities and Priorities in Transportation,https://urbandesignforum.org/future-living-possibilities-and-priorities-in-transportation/,"February 26, 2018","Instead of asking which new transportation service will win the market, we should ask: what kind of future do we want? The latest transportation technologies—offering automation, connectedness, and electrification—promise to improve convenience and safety and increase the dollars in our wallet. But this still falls short of what we ought to seek: Genuine safety from automobile violence for all. Balanced access to convenient service to promote equity. Social cohesion fostered by thriving places. Together, these three aspirations define a new vision of mobility, one centered on human needs rather than one defined by promises that technology has yet to deliver. Safety from Automobile Violence One of the major promises of new transportation technologies is the possibility that vehicles themselves could provide more safety from human error. Of the 35,095 fatalities on U.S. roads in 2015, 29 percent were due to drivers drinking too much alcohol and 27 percent were due to speeding, making more than 50 percent of crash fatalities the result of human error.1 In cities, many fatalities are due to the lack of infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists and a driving culture that gives preferential treatment to drivers. Further, longstanding discriminatory practices in housing policy, financing mechanisms, and infrastructure decisions have created segregated neighborhoods and a system that privileges wealthy, white neighborhoods over poor, minority neighborhoods. New technologies will not automatically dismantle these historic discriminations. Instead, we should be concerned with how those new technologies may reflect existing biases. Ideally automation may anticipate conflict factors. Yet there is an infinitesimal combination of external factors that complicate any single trip in a car, and none of these technologies can replace well-designed streets that protect the most vulnerable such as the elderly, children, and people walking and biking. More recently, cars have been used as weapons to terrorize people in public spaces. Though few things could have thwarted the recent acts of terrorism in New York, Barcelona, London, and Nice (among many other cities), these are not issues that can be easily solved by automation alone. But urban design and policies limiting the presence of cars could have a mitigating effect. Vehicle design cannot override the self-reinforcing conditions shaped by the physical design of our streets. Will automation—even when the algorithms are also designed by humans? Careful management and the inclusion of a multitude of users is needed to ensure that the future has the potential to lessen harm, rather than perpetuate it. Balanced Access for Greater Equity At the curb, automation and connectivity might actually force us to come up with ways to better manage this popular and particular space. In dense urban areas, too many users are jockeying for precious space at the same time. And too few are paying for the privilege of accessing such spaces. From the outset, the curb can be better managed if people are able to travel through a city without needing to drive themselves. Automation and connectivity could help, so long as there are strong incentives for sharing; perhaps people can be dropped off by a shared vehicle, or walk, or maybe a bike ride is within reach. Part of the problem with managing the curb to better support people within our existing urban design is the inadequate pricing schemes that represent the value we place on our shared spaces and particular modes of travel. We underprice parking, overlook the real value of real estate, and deny ourselves the truth that if we were all to drive our own cars, demand for access would far exceed the supply of urban space. There is no real proof yet that automation will completely rid us of congestion. High externalities and costs to society are still far too easy and permissible. The concern is that if more automated and connected vehicles are introduced to our already congested world, it would require a major catastrophe before we can muster the political will to mandate a more rational pricing system that reflects broader societal benefits. But automation and connectedness could expand our travel options. New vehicle sizes, electrification, improved transit especially via surface modes—perhaps these are the ingredients we need to achieve the ultimate transportation option: mobility as a service. This would comprise of a single subscription to every transportation option available, without the hassle of ownership. We currently manage numerous subscriptions to access various transportation options: a fob for the bikeshare, a card for mass transit, a membership number for the car share, and perhaps personal insurance and storage for our own vehicle. The future is not about ownership and our management of such services, but how transportation services can support the lives we want to lead. Our future thus becomes less about making driving easy and more about choices. A people-oriented city is not a city without mobility. It is a city with right-sized options for different kinds of trips: a bike share for the meeting two miles away; transit rides to cross town quickly; walking around the neighborhood for daily essentials; buses that already meet the curb grade, so strollers and the elderly can smoothly alight. As you can see, many of these issues are not solved by new technologies per se, but will be created through different agency practices, policies, and funding mechanisms. All of these technology potentials could make more room for people on the street, create new opportunities to be social, and all will have a profound effect on public life. Yet none of them deal with the systemic inequities that many people experience every day. Will technology rid us of the systemic racism that is the daily experience of walking on the street for Black and Latino communities? Will the choices offered by future technologies level the playing field for those who cannot afford Uber or Lyft today? Social Benefits, Not Only Efficiency The spaces we want are filled with diverse people sharing space, interacting, or perhaps sitting alone among people. We want to be able to go to these places without needing to buy something to prove our worth. Even better, we want to visit places where we have a sense of belonging. Spaces like this are shaped by both their communities and the physical characteristics of the public realm. While this is not new to planners and designers, transportation planning’s conventional focus on flows of vehicles rather than social benefits has led to a tendency to emphasize efficiency over lingering. Amazon’s recently issued request for proposals for its second headquarters illustrates the desire for these spaces, stipulating walkable places with close proximity to amenities and culture, and plenty of public transit options. Apple’s renaming of its stores as “Town Squares” suggests that even they would like spaces that encourage social interactions, mixing, and community. Such gestures attest to a growing demand—even from technology giants that are enabling an automated future—for shared physical spaces and a desire for a thriving public realm where people can come together. We enter the public realm when we step outside of our homes and private cars; the public realm comprises the ultimate shared space. In our cities, streets make up 80 percent of this shared space. These streets and spaces between buildings are where we meet neighbors, and run into the same guy selling water and coffee, or shilling the free daily. These are the spaces that bind us as a society. Streets are a determining physical factor, where social connections are made. An automated, connected, and electrified transportation system can enable some of these things, or it can actively work against them. Physical street spaces could benefit from these new technologies. Vehicle travel lanes could be narrower, making room for physically protected bike lane and wider sidewalks that accommodate strollers and wheelchairs. Such design strategies also make the kinds of spots where we like to linger—a spot in the sun, quiet from honking cars, a place to chat with a friend—much easier to carve out from cities that don’t have much space to begin with. When the public realm thrives, we tend not to feel alone though we may know no one. Seeing people fulfills some of our social needs. Research show that people are more likely to see people when traveling at people speed, which acts as an invitation to continue down the street.2 People walk at about three miles per hour, far slower than the current recommendations for efficient traffic flow. It is at this slower speed that we employ a fuller range of our senses and can perceive human qualities of others. People get the most benefit from the public realm when it is designed at the human scale, a scale that fosters human interactions. A recent meta-analysis showed that people with strong social connections are 50 percent more likely to outlive people who do not. In that study, they write that strong social connections alone have the same magnitude effect on health as the act of quitting smoking.3 Our cities are currently filled with more than enough space to store our cars, through parking spaces protected in building garages, underground, and on surface lots or the street. We have an estimated 2 billion parking spaces for 236 million cars—a terrible waste of space. Even with all the space in the world, no one will object to the simple observation that it is much nicer to sit next to a tree than it is to sit next to a parked car, just as it is nicer to see people’s faces than to whiz by a strip mall. The majority of these car storage spaces could be repurposed for greater value if transportation technology is to deliver on its promise of on-demand, clean, and shared. The development and adoption of transportation technologies cannot be left solely to the private sector. But neither will cities that truly cater to human needs come about without deep reflection from our public leaders about how current systems perpetuate inequalities. Today, our streets are best for drivers, but only white drivers. Bike share is available in many cities, but primarily in wealthier neighborhoods. Uber and Lyft drivers will pick anyone up on-demand, but only those who are able to walk without a wheelchair. Transit is good for the elderly, but when so few of the elevators work, what is the point? Technology does little to guarantee walkable, dense cities either. We must understand who users truly are and their genuine needs. All of the uses, regardless of the operator, travel on the public right of way, and the public sector must balance the multiple demands on how these shared spaces are used. This vision of social cohesion, equitable access, and safety from automobile violence is not achievable without considering human needs in what has been a primarily technological equation. This is not so much about disruption by technology as much as it is about municipal governments becoming much more transformational with updated policies, regulations, and enforcement to manage the future of our streets. And we can’t leave out the culture change needed to motivate this shift in governance and management of transportation. Instead of asking what kind of future transportation technology will bring us, we should ask: what kind of city do we want? Technology advocates sometimes act as though it can predict and manage all human factors. We should not forget that even if it could, technology will not even begin to erase systemic inequities due to human biases. It will only reflect what we already carry out with our current systems. Perhaps transportation technologies are tools that can help us control our destiny, especially in how we shape cities of tomorrow. But it’s still up to us, the people, to ensure that all our neighbors are included in the calculation for a brighter transportation future. — Shin-pei Tsay is the executive director of Gehl Institute, a non-profit whose mission is to make public life a driver for policy, design, and governance.

64,Incomplete Streets: Who’s Missing from “Complete Streets?”,https://urbandesignforum.org/incomplete-streets-whos-missing-from-complete-streets/,"February 26, 2018","Cities in the United States have suffered from 80 years of development shaped by an undying commitment to the automobile as the primary mode of transit. This commitment has left a physical legacy of air pollution and associated health risks and impacts, poor public transit options and unsafe conditions for pedestrians and bicyclists in both old metropolitan areas (e.g., New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Detroit) and newer urban centers (e.g., Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas). In each of these cities, and in many other smaller cities, low income and minority communities have borne the worst effects of auto-centric development. Not only have these communities been disproportionately utilized as the locus of industrial and other unwanted development, they have also been used as transportation corridors facilitating the speedy movement of people and goods through (or often over) their neighborhoods. This benefitted the suburban dweller and downtown employer, but not the highway-dissected community. Recent trends in urban planning and policy aim to challenge this auto-normative paradigm by reversing the broader effects of an urban form shaped by the logics of keeping automobiles moving. The aim of creating “Complete Streets” in “walkable” and “livable cities” is an example of such an effort. Transportation Alternatives Magazine boldly asserts: “The Complete Streets revolution has begun.”1 Everyone, it seems, from planners to public health professionals to politicians wants them. Perhaps the greatest evidence of the “revolution,” at least in the US context, is the proliferation of policies and laws institutionalizing and codifying Complete Streets as a guiding principle in urban planning. “Communities of all sizes are transforming their streets into more than just a way to move people in cars from one place to another,” reports the National Complete Streets Coalition. “These communities are part of a growing national movement for Complete Streets.” In fact, the National Complete Streets Coalition’s 2013 report on best Complete Streets policies of 2012 claims that there are now 488 Complete Streets policies across the US. These exist at all levels of government, including 27 statewide policies.2 If there is indeed a Complete Streets revolution, then the objective must be to challenge the paradigm that produces in-Complete Streets. So, what exactly do we mean in calling this essay (and the book it’s adapted from) Incomplete Streets? Complete Streets First introduced to the lexicon in 2003 by Barbara McCann, a staff member of the advocacy organization America Bikes, Complete Streets was proposed as an alternative to the term “routine accommodation,” which was being used to convey the need to include bicycles in transportation planning. As McCann recounts, “Right away, we knew that we had a concept that was bigger than bicycles”.3 Advocates and transportation planners were brought together and eventually developed the following definition of a Complete Streets policy: A Complete Streets policy ensures that the entire right of way is routinely designed and operated to enable safe access for all users. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities must be able to safely move along and across a complete street.4 While Complete Streets is the zeitgeist in the US, it is rhetorically linked to concepts commonly used outside the US such as “Livable Cities” and “Cities for People.” Developing as part of and related to the urban planning über-narrative of “place-making,” the movement has transformed the frames of livable, walkable streets into a mobilizing frame that has led to coalition building and activism, influenced legislation and policy, and provided the average citizen with a compelling and tangible vision of the potential of their streets beyond that of mere automobile conduit. For the National Complete Streets Coalition in the US, the movement is about changing the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials paradigm from “moving cars quickly” to “providing safe access for all modes,” including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities. The Coalition adds that the Complete Streets movement “encourages and provides for safe access to destinations for everyone, regardless of age, ability, income, ethnicity, or mode of travel.” Implicit in the Complete Streets concept is the notion that streets are not currently designed to meet the needs of all users. It conveys the message that streets are ultimately public spaces, and that everyone in the community—from pedestrians to bicyclists to public transit users—should have equal rights to space within them, irrespective of whether they are driving a car or not. “[This] street-level spatial justice, this ‘democratization of the street’ through the redistribution of rights to (and in) public space,” according to Agyeman, “may make the street look physically different, but…also fundamentally rewires our brains, affecting the way we think.”5 In this way, adding these “other” street users effectively de-centers the motorist while potentially bringing together previously disconnected interest groups—people with disabilities, bicyclists, senior citizens, public transit advocates and others—into a powerful coalition. Streets, the movement implies, are incomplete when they are designed, constructed and maintained with the primary objective of moving automobiles efficiently. Incomplete streets While we certainly agree with its challenge to auto-normativity, our aim is to provoke a more critical use and application of the Complete Streets concept by urban planners, policy-makers, and academics—investigating the question: “Complete for whom?” If the movement claims that Complete Streets policies, when implemented, “complete” previously incomplete streets, then we ought to ask whether all street users are, in fact, gaining safe access to streets “regardless of age, ability, income, ethnicity, or mode of travel”.6 The accepted definition of Complete Streets, while recognizing “diversity,” refers to “users” of streets. This effectively reduces people primarily to their mode of transportation. Yet not everyone’s mode of transportation is a choice. Some people choose to cycle while others are forced to. What mistakes might we be making in assuming that redesigning streets with the goal of providing safe access to all users of streets can sufficiently address the broader historical, political, social, and economic forces shaping the socioeconomic and racial inequalities embedded in and reproduced by the spaces we call streets? Like Doreen Massey, we see places (and streets are places) as having no fixed meaning; rather, they are “constantly shifting articulations of social relations through time.”7 Yet much of the current physically-focused Complete Streets rhetoric disconnects streets from their significant social, structural, symbolic, discursive, and historical realities. Economically, ethnically, and racially diverse members of communities are referred to monolithically as “users.” Assumptions are made that “users” make rational choices about different “modes” of transportation available to get themselves from point A to point B. We call for a (re) conceptualization of Complete Streets that humanizes “users” by acknowledging their difference and diversity and by asking questions about how individuals’ experiences as historically marginalized members of society (and users of streets), among other identities, impinge on their ability to participate in dialogues about Complete Streets, and whether their lack of voice in turn gives shape to urban spaces that subtly, and not so subtly, exclude certain individuals. In the wake of the rapid and largely unproblematized rise of the Complete Streets movement, it is vital to ask these questions if the movement is to fully deliver on its promises. Few urban planners are asking these types of questions. Academics, especially in fields such as urban geography, planning and sociology, where we might expect to see an interest, have given the Complete Streets phenomenon scant attention. The public health focus on the influence of the built environment on physical activity and health typically leaves out an analysis of other important social processes shaping how people interact with space and place, whether symbolic or material. Transportation engineers focus almost exclusively on the technical aspects of the design of Complete Streets, with occasional interest in political processes that open and close doors for Complete Streets projects. Long champions of Complete Streets, progressive urban planners have yet to engage in a specifically socially just framing within their discourse. Beyond peer-reviewed publications, there are a handful of reports and other analyses or recommendations for addressing the issue of equity with respect to Complete Streets policies and practices. But their approach focuses solely on the issue of transportation equity without consideration of the broader structural, historical, political, and economic factors that shape people’s places within urban systems. Whether Complete Streets can achieve equity objectives remains to be seen, as too few Complete Streets policies have resulted in implementation of the types of projects that would allow such an analysis. More troubling is the way in which Complete Streets are abstracted and treated as theoretical ideals. Inarguably, if the non-driving population is overrepresented by the poor, people of color, seniors, and people with disabilities, then designing streets that give non-drivers a fair share of road space, in theory, will make streets more equitable. But streets do not exist in the abstract. They are (usually) paved surfaces that exist in physical spaces within a city. The spaces in between the streets, and sometimes the streets themselves, provide places for city dwellers to reside, work, recreate, worship, and engage in countless other activities that constitute city life. Streets connect these spaces in ways that advantage certain parts of the city, or certain residents within the city, over other parts of the city and its residents. A Complete Streets project, when implemented, might cover a mere three or four city blocks. Ambitious projects in larger cities might cover more. Regardless, when implemented incrementally, Complete Streets will inevitably benefit certain people in certain urban spaces and not others. Complete Streets’ design and mobility principles and preferences include the introduction of bicycle lanes, street accessibility improvements, mass transit expansions and upgrades, and pedestrian zone placements. However, these physical changes can make certain street users and the dwellers in some neighborhoods, invisible, further diminishing their rights and roles in the community. In these predominantly low-income communities and neighborhoods of color, people worry that such changes will foster gentrification. Historical narrative and the right to the city We must remain attentive to the question of whether the ways Complete Streets narratives, policies, plans, and efforts are envisioned and implemented might be systematically reproducing and even amplifying many of the urban spatial and social inequalities and injustices that have characterized cities for the last century or more. We ought to push planners and policy-makers, academics, activists, and laypeople to think more critically about streets, not just as physical and material amenities that function to move people and goods, but as significant social and symbolic spaces where users are linked to intersecting economic, transportation, food, cultural, and governance systems, as well as personal, group, and community histories and experiences. Streets and the communities they connect are physical and symbolic spaces with great potential. They can reflect and reproduce the social structures, inequalities, and injustices that continue to shape and define many urban lives. But they can also empower and engage, build civic and social capital, and create opportunities, if seen in their wider contexts. Ultimately, our intent is to demonstrate the power of seeing streets not as fixed, but as constantly adapting and evolving physical, social, and symbolic spaces of creativity and contestation, and that social equity is essential in facilitating the constant adaptation and evolution that streets must undergo in response to the changing communities around them. Inequality creates powerful vested interests committed to maintaining the status quo, which sees streets as spaces that primarily function to move privileged people using privileged modes of transportation in order to get them to places of work, consumption, and recreation. We then, are concerned both with streets that are incomplete from the urban planner’s perspective (i.e., streets that exclude non-drivers), as well as with the incompleteness of ostensibly “complete” streets. In employing the concept of Incomplete Streets, we intend to draw attention to important missing narratives in the Complete Streets discourse and practice. In studying New Haven, Connecticut, Talja Blokland showed how place-making (and by extrapolation Complete Street-making) can be seen as a struggle between residents’ different historical narratives (which thereby define “the community”).8 If any of the historical narratives are absent from the dominant picture of who the community is, that picture will therefore be distorted. In short, we contend that there are important missing people—namely people of color, immigrants, the poor and other historically disenfranchised individuals—in popular narratives of Complete Streets. Similarly, the notion of Incomplete Streets evokes an understanding of streets as lived and ultimately contested spaces and asks us to consider the types of spaces, for example, recreational, religious, commercial, and, most importantly, public, that may or may not be missing from hypothetically Complete Streets. Finally, David Harvey reminds us of the broader context for participation in Complete Streets at the discursive, narrative, and physical levels, namely, that they are a part of our Right to the City: “The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is … one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights”.9 – Julian Agyeman is Professor in the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning (UEP) at Tufts University, USA.

65,The Urban Digital Transformation: A Perspective for the Next 25 Years,https://urbandesignforum.org/the-urban-digital-transformation-a-perspective-for-the-next-25-years/,"February 26, 2018","Just as Rome was transformed by the aqueduct and New York by the elevator; cities around the world are now being shaped by digital technology. Smartphones, Transportation Network Companies (TNCs—like Uber and Lyft), and the flows of online retail have all made the city of 2017 remarkably different from that of 1997. However, we are yet to see the fundamental shifts that previous waves of technological advances wrought on urban life and form. We are still in the early stages of the digital revolution, and it is difficult to see just how it will be manifest. I’d like to offer three ways—from the small to the profound—in which I expect cities to change over the next three decades. I have chosen these less because they are the most important, but rather because they best illustrate how technology might transform the urban—not just by introducing new information into our spaces, but by making new behavior patterns feasible and desirable. The Self-Driving Vehicle The most visible change to the city we can expect is the emergence of the self-driving vehicle. It’s still difficult to say how quickly this technology will be adopted, but it’s safe to predict that the most obvious difference between images of 2017 and 2067 will be the types of vehicles on the street—as is true today if we compare photos from 1917 and 1967. Much has been written on how autonomous vehicles (AVs) might be used—and for that matter how their usage might change cities—and the general expectations are as follows:1 First, self-driving vehicles should be dramatically safer than human motorists. Driver distraction, the cause of roughly half of all US road collisions today, would be effectively eliminated. Further, since self-driving vehicles can be programmed to obey the law and drive with high levels of prevision, the public realm in the urban environment will be much safer. After all, the potential for a car to run a red light or fail to yield is much lower with a computer following directions than with a frustrated urban driver. Second, self-driving vehicles should eliminate the need for on-site parking. When a car can be programmed to guide itself to a parking space two or twenty minutes away from a drop-off point, the need for nearby parking diminishes. Vast amounts of space currently devoted to curbside parking could be opened up. Imagine if all of Manhattan’s arteries could be de-clogged of automobile storage and their throughput could be significantly improved without any other changes. Finally, self-driving vehicles could enable far more efficient driving patterns. Instead of accelerating out of one stoplight and slamming on the brakes at the next, AVs can be programmed to travel at speeds optimized for safety, ride comfort, and energy efficiency. They can even adapt to surrounding driving patterns to improve overall system performance before all vehicles are self-driving. The key phrase here is that self-driving vehicles can be programmed to do these things. They are choices—not inherent qualities of the technology—so to achieve these results, standards must evolve. If riders have the option to choose an ‘aggressive’ mode for their ride, the safety benefits of the AV will be largely lost. On the other hand, if vehicles always prioritize pedestrian safety, traffic might come to a standstill with pedestrians no longer fearing for their lives, crossing streets whenever and wherever they please. These problems raise what is perhaps the greatest question regarding self-driving technology: whether it will simply replace today’s personal vehicles without the hassles of driving, or if it will foster an entirely new set of uses that are, on balance, better for the city. If people abandon auto ownership, rely on self-driving vans, and are willing to accept slight detours with pooled trips, it is easy to imagine AVs creating more pleasant city streets. The International Transport Forum’s simulations for Lisbon found that shared-ride AVs could replace all bus service in the city, offering far better overall travel service to both drivers and bus-riders. However, if people own their own vehicles, and send them home to save on downtown parking rates, the AV would become an agent of increased congestion and sprawl. Whatever the case, it is safe to say that as the cost of driving falls—in the form of a driver’s time—we will see a spike in the average miles traveled per vehicle. The Managed Curb While the autonomous vehicle may be a visible player in images of the future city, photos are unlikely to capture a second remarkable change: the shift to a dynamically managed curb. Today, the curb is one of the most poorly-managed spaces in the city: under-priced, under-regulated, and over-congested. Most of it is used for automobile storage, and at best, spaces are reserved for different activities on a first-come, first-served basis.2 This lackadaisical management fundamentally conflicts with the just-in-time nature of urban transportation, and the double parking that plagues our busiest streets today are just the most obvious symptom. I’d argue that digital technology will force planners to consider curbs to the point where they become some of the best-managed spaces in the city. Today, a driver looking to park their car for an hour or more is willing to go a few blocks out of the way. But a passenger in a for-hire vehicle expects to be dropped off right at their destination, especially important during pick ups when drivers need to reliably find their passengers and vice versa. Similarly, when consumers shops at a retail store, deliveries can be made in bulk to a viable loading zone near the store’s freight entrance. However, when a UPS or FedEx driver needs to deliver a parcel, they have only minutes per stop and must park as close to their destination as possible: a curbside spot. Both for-hire rides and deliveries encourage double-parking because they aren’t there that long. One doesn’t double-park for an hour or two; it’s too obvious that you’ll get a ticket. But if you only need the space for ten, five, or even three minutes, then double-parking is fairly safe. Our parking enforcement system does not generally have the capability to enforce violations that are only three minutes long. This creates the potential to make the curb highly efficient because the digital technology that enables TNCs and inexpensive home deliveries also makes it possible to manage their use of the curb. A Lyft driver knows exactly where they need a parking space, and with a five- to ten-minute lead time, when they need it: not “about 10:30am” but “from 10:32 to 10:35”. The same is true with a FedEx driver, who know where their next stop is and exactly how many deliveries need to be made there. Unlike drivers today—for whom arranging parking in advance would require a plus-or-minus window of fifteen minutes or more—these users can predict their own usage of the curb with great precision. These same technologies can enable constant curb enforcement. Although GPS is too imprecise a technology for this use, the array of sensors and cameras that digital technology allows will make it possible to enforce and charge for curbside usage on a constant basis, making it a far better deal to arrange—and pay—for a three-minute parking space than to occupy someone else’s spot and be guaranteed a large fine. Taken together, the demand and the potential both suggest that cities are likely to move to highly managed curbs. Citizens who rely on free on-street parking are likely to resist in the near term, but I expect these approaches to be first applied to areas where such parking is currently prohibited, like airports and downtown loading zones. Over time the crush of double-parking will become a bigger detriment to most neighborhoods than the lack of parking spaces—especially as self-driving vehicles come into widespread usage—and so the curb might become the most efficiently used space in the city. The Inversion of Transit-Oriented Development It is possible, however, that the most profound effect that digital technology will have on the shape of cities will be neither as visible as the self-driving vehicle nor as efficient as the dynamic curb. Rather, these advancements have the potential to invert the way physical transportation nodes have traditionally shaped urban form. Cities have almost always been built on the unevenness of transportation access created by physical infrastructure.3 The most obvious example is the way that density naturally clusters around rail transit hubs; but it is true even at lower levels of ‘fixity’, around bus stops and highway interchanges. The value of land generally responds to proximity to transportation nodes, and for more than a generation, American urban planners have prioritized ‘transit-oriented development’ as a cornerstone for thoughtful urban growth. Digital technology offers the potential to undermine the importance of these physical channels. If digital wayfinding becomes the standard, the ‘easy-on, easy-off’ location near the highway exit loses its value. In a world of flexibly dispatched buses, bus stops aren’t meaningful: instead of passengers congregating at fixed places to access a bus, buses will adjust their routes to reach passengers. And if the vision of a world of shared, self-driving taxibots becomes a reality, there is theoretically no location that is more or less accessible than any other, in part because driving time can be used for other purposes. Such uniform access to mobility suggests a return to von Thünen’s “undifferentiated plain”, where distance from a center is the only determinant of land use.4 But technologies that diminish the importance of physical channels altogether reveal the potential of these digital systems to generate channels of their own. It’s already been noted that Waze can create traffic problems where none previously existed; and that the invisible pricing systems of UberPool, LyftLine, and similar ride-pooling services can make some routes or points cheaper without anyone noticing. Rather than following any nefarious scheme, these would likely follow the logic of the transportation network–just as airlines charge higher fares at “fortress hubs” than at competitive airports—but can still lead to unintended inequities. For example, if the logic of pooled-ride services become widely used, they should result in dramatically lower costs to travel on routes where additional riders are likely to be found. However, this could lead to unintended land-use differences on the basis of class or race, just as New York City yellow cabs still rarely leave Manhattan’s wealthy core because overwhelming patterns of demand rarely compel them to serve the outer boroughs. This suggests that demand and pricing may one day become the key shaper of urban form. Routes with dependable levels of demand—or where certain premium customers are reliably present to generate profits for car services—will likely have lower costs and more frequent service. Routes with less demand—or, perhaps, with a high concentration of price-sensitive customers—may suffer. In this way, the urban transportation patterns of the future may be more akin to today’s airline map, where routes with reliable business travel (New York to London, for example) are much easier and cheaper than shorter trips with different demand profiles. This isn’t necessarily bad, but it isn’t necessarily good, either. It’s just different, and urban planners will need to consider both how traditional land-use decisions can shape these digital channels and how the invisible overlay of digital transportation management may be shaping their cities. Imagining the future All told, digital technology promises to transform cities, in ways that will range from the obvious and the desirable to the subtle and ambivalent. These are just three areas where one observer thinks change is likely. Few tasks are as fraught as envisioning the future, but the history of urban technology promises that the changes of the digital age are likely to be both profound and complex. – Rohit T. “Rit” Aggarwala is an experienced executive and thought leader in sustainability, environmental, and urban issues.

Posted on April 7, 2017 In his short story “There Will Come Soft Rains,” Ray Bradbury envisioned an automated house that could wake its inhabitants, cook their breakfast, read them poetry, and bring forth the furniture they needed when they needed it. But when a storm-blown tree branch comes crashing through a wall, bursting a bottle of flammable cleaning solution on the stove, the house fails to fight back: “Fire!” screamed a voice. The house lights flashed, water pumps shot water from the ceilings. But the solvent spread on the linoleum, licking, eating, under the kitchen door, while the voices took it up in chorus: “Fire, fire, fire!” The house tried to save itself. Doors sprang tightly shut, but the windows were broken by the heat and the wind blew and sucked upon the fire. All photos from the series “In the Year 2000” by Jean-Marc Côté Bradbury’s house sounds only remotely out of reach today. Sprinklers and smoke alarms, incidentally, are perhaps the most familiar and influential “smart building” technologies in the United States. Sprinklers lower the death rate in structure fires by 82 percent, and cut the monetary damage to homes and apartments by 65 percent. The National Institute of Standards and Technology credited smoke alarms as “the greatest success story in fire safety” of the past fifty years (though there’s some dispute about causation), relegating most American fire departments to cat-catching for a pension. It’s the functioning elements of Bradbury’s future house that we are only now reaching, as the Internet permeates both the structural elements of the house—locks, heat, light, plumbing—and appliances like televisions and refrigerators. But while industry experts expect to see rapid adoption within the next two to four years of “smart home” devices, and the world’s largest corporations have embraced “connectivity” as a strategic goal, there are signs that regular people are a little less enthused about living inside a connected home. Privacy In 2014, Panasonic and 18 other companies opened Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town, a “smart city” development outside of Tokyo. It was on the one hand a testament to the gains that IoT can wring from the urban environment for generalized social gains. Energy efficiency is paramount, and every resident gets personal reports with advice on energy consumption habits. Fujisawa SST also plans to feature more personal innovations like a digital mirror to brief residents on weight gains and sleeping patterns. When Panasonic broke ground on a similar project, a hub for its enterprise division outside Denver (the mile-high city beat out 21 competitors with its offer of good site and subsidy), the company left out many Japanese innovations. Americans weren’t ready, the company thought. “You have to make sure citizens are cool with having ‘eyes on,’” Jarrett Wendt, the company’s vice president for strategic initiatives, told me last year. “It’s a bogeyman, because in most big cities there are cameras on anyway, but citizens don’t realize it.” Cities like that these collaborations can introduce new cost-saving technology, especially in lighting and other utilities. But they also like playing host for a technocratic utopia. Denver isn’t the only city to jump at an opportunity to partner with a Smart City corporation. Kansas City has a similar partnership with Cisco that it hopes will provide smart-city data to local entrepreneurs. Most civic power players like the idea of the city as laboratory, and their development as experiment. That’s the pattern: While corporations and cities charge forward with surveillance, data mining, and connected infrastructure, citizens lag behind. It’s partly, as Panasonic gleaned, because of concerns about privacy. We’re only just learning how the powers of connected devices will be deployed. In March, the Vault 7 leak revealed that the CIA had developed a program called “Weeping Angel” to use Samsung “smart” televisions as covert surveillance devices. Police responding to a murder in Bentonville, Arkansas discovered a home equipped with a Nest thermostat, a Honeywell alarm system, and an Amazon Echo. The Echo’s “always listening” functionality may play a key role in the murder trial. Difficulty While smart home devices like the Echo or the Samsung “smart” TV can be purchased and turned on by anyone, the more influential features of the smart home must be installed. Eager to be cutting edge and seeking (like corporations and cities) the marginal mass savings afforded by smart tech, developers are now building smart thermostats into new buildings. But most Americans live in older homes that are either incompatible with new technology or must be retrofitted to accommodate it. “If people can’t set the time on their VCR then setting up a wireless connection to a water sensor in a wall is not necessarily the easiest thing to do,” John Lucker, a principal at Deloitte who analyzes the IoT market, explained. Venture capital money is pushing companies to get products to market, sold, and installed. But manufacturing and sales often outrun quality control, programmatic integrity, and cybersecurity, Lucker said. As companies with VC-backed balance sheets surge into the market, only to fizzle out when funding runs out, consumers risk finding that new tech installed at great cost is now unsupported, useless, or trafficking in metrics that the industry no longer uses. This churn is a societal problem, as thousands of new unsecured ports make systems vulnerable. In October, an attack that brought down much of the American internet originated and spread through IoT-connected cameras, baby monitors, and Wi-Fi routers. But it’s also a personal problem, as when a glitch with Google Nest thermostats turned off the heat in an untold number of homes last winter—the latest in a series of snafus involving software updates to the product. Even HVAC professionals have trouble managing the devices. Money The current technological landscape is characterized by the competing desires of companies and consumers. Consider the push for voice-based user interfaces (though texting has virtually abolished talking on the phone, and employees would rather Slack then chat out loud), or the massive cash investment in video-based media (though millennials are even more likely than previous generations to prefer text-based news). Smart homes, like pre-roll ads, are considerably more attractive to companies than citizens. Utilities and insurance companies, for example, are excited to attach sensors to your thermostat, pipes, doors and windows. They have already pioneered “telematics” in car and health insurance, where you can lower your premiums if you agree to be monitored on your car dashboard or around your wrist. But what does smart-home tech bring to you besides discounts on insurance and utilities, which must be weighed against large up-front purchase and installation costs? In conversations with millennials about smart home tech, I sensed both optimism and trepidation. Optimism about savings; trepidation about uses. For the moment, too many “smart” devices are high-cost gimmicks with significant potential downsides. Those Samsung “smart” TVs that the CIA can hack to spy on you? They let you watch multiple shows at once, control the channel with your voice, and use the television as an alarm clock. We were promised flying cars; we got a television alarm clock.

Aging Better with Technology Posted on April 7, 2017 In the 2001 Simpsons Halloween special “House of Whacks,” the family gets sold a total home upgrade – the Ultrahouse 3000 – where everything is controlled by a central computer, becoming the ultimate “smart” home. Meaning everything from laundry to their alarms to dinner preparation was controlled by the home’s central computer. When Marge updates the home’s voice to sexy Pierce Brosnan, “Pierce” quickly becomes infatuated with Marge and attempts to kill Homer by sucking him into the garbage disposal that’s part of the kitchen table. The episode was a parody on 2001: A Space Odyssey and Demon Seed, and has always stuck with me as a humorous reminder of the promises and perils of smart home technology. Scene from “House of Whacks” where the house attempts to kill Homer to get to Marge (Daily Mars) The concept behind the smart home is rooted in sustainable design and energy efficiency. Using a sensor system embedded within the home and appliances, home or building owners can control and monitor home energy, lighting, and appliance usage – realizing lower energy costs, lower carbon-footprints, and, hopefully, a better quality of life. Implementation of smart home technology has evolved alongside mobile phone technology, making it easier for a person to have complete control over their home with their smart devices; from controlling the indoor temperature, being able to see who is at the front door when the bell rings, to programming music of choice to start playing when you enter the door. Increased sophistication in smart home technologies opens the door to other potential applications that could have positive health benefits. New smart home applications are already being deployed to improve the quality of life for older adults, a segment of the population that is living longer and growing rapidly. Here in New York City, a city that offers one of the best age-friendly initiatives in the world, we can find examples of how smart home technologies are being used to improve the lives of older adults. Selfhelp Community Services is a non-profit social services agency in New York City that operates affordable senior living and senior centers, trains and employees home health aides, and provides other social services to older adults. Selfhelp is one of the largest human services providers in the New York City area, servicing over 20,000 elderly New Yorkers. I spoke to David Dring, the Executive Director of Innovations at Selfhelp Community Services, about how his organization is utilizing technology to help enrich the lives of the older adults: “At a minimum, we do this for our buildings, we wire them for Wi-Fi…technologies, so it is ready for people to be mobile throughout the building with that technology. And as they age in place, we are continuing to look for different opportunities that can take advantage of these technologies to communicate with our health team or a third party health team, in providing them with meaningful telehealth services.” Additionally, Selfhelp has created something called the virtual senior center, which enables homebound older adults to connect to programming at their senior centers. The goal being to increase social interaction and engagement with those who might be socially isolated. Other promising applications of smart home technology include automation for appliances and locks, as well as daily reminders to take medication, which can improve safety and help those with memory problems. According to David, in-home sensing systems can also monitor people’s movements around the space, helping to alert care givers if someone has fallen or is another critical situation that hinders their mobility. Sensing technology placed in the home that monitors general vital signs, such as heart rate or heat signatures, could replace the need for wearables that might be easily forgotten to be put or taken off in the shower. Selfhelp’s Virtual Senior Center (Serving Seniors) Other examples of smart home technology implementation geared at older adults were provided by Scott Code, who works in the Center for Aging Services Technologies at LeadingAge, a national association for aging service providers. In one example, passive sensors placed underneath the bed were piloted and then fully implemented in Terraces of Los Gatos (TLG), a non-profit continuing care retirement community in Northern California. The goal of the bed sensors were to prevent pressure ulcers, falls and develop patient centered care plans. Following a pilot, sensors were installed in all beds in the facility and fairly dramatic outcomes were achieved, including a reduction in facility-acquired pressure ulcers by nearly 100% and a 50% reduction in falls. Referencing an experience he had with a previous employer (Selfhelp), Scott told me about another example of how sensing technology was able to proactively help caregivers identify a potential health condition in one of their clients and get them into care much faster: “For instance, when we had the QuietCare system at Selfhelp, a woman kept getting up in the middle of the night. Normally, she gets up one or two times a night, but with this system, it picked up that, from midnight to 6:00 a.m., she got up eight times, and it sent the social worker an alert. And it ended up that she had a urinary tract infection, and she went to see the doctor right away, and it was taken care of, and she really didn’t get sick. That could have gone on for weeks if this system didn’t pick it up.” Challenges Although the potential perils of smart home technology aren’t as grave as those posed to the Simpsons by Ultrahouse 3000, recent cyber-attacks on the “internet of things” has revealed major security concerns with these technologies and how easy it is to break into them. Based on a recent literature review, privacy was found to be one of the top concerns among older adults when it comes to implementation of smart home technologies. David, Scott, and Lindsay Goldman – Deputy Director of Aging in the Center for Health Policy and Programs at the New York Academy of Medicine – echoed this concern but felt that this particular barrier was not insurmountable and that the benefits clearly outweighed the potential risks. The major challenges, from their perspectives, were interface design, the lack of funding to implement these technologies on a broad scale, and equity. According to David, one of the biggest challenges “is sort of the interface design and making it what I consider extremely easy to use and making it self-evident… Privacy is going to be an important factor, but I don’t think of it as being a limiting factor.” “There’s an equity issue. I think technology has the potential to improve people’s life and can help facilitate increased independence. But it’s a question of how, who, where it’s deployed, how much it costs, and how accessible it is.” –Lindsay Goldman Another challenge in implementing smart home technologies with older adults is ensuring that proper education is coupled with the intervention in order to ensure that the intended behavior changes occur. This engagement shouldn’t only happen with the individuals, but with caregivers and family members as well. Scott shared a story with me illustrating what can happen when the proper education and engagement doesn’t occur: “There was a home-care worker that came into an individual’s apartment that had this sensor technology, and there’s a sensor in the bathroom, and the home-care worker kept taking the sensor off the wall because she thought it was taking pictures of her while she was in the bathroom. As a result, it was causing an alert that the older adult might have fallen because there was no motion…You need to educate not only the family, the person living there, but anyone that comes into the home just because they need to know what’s going on and understand the value of it.” Looking Forward With a growing older adult population and ongoing advances in sensing technology, the potential applications for smart home technology to promote health and create a better quality of life are enormous. Those I interviewed mentioned that the appearance of voice activated systems on the market, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, have great potential in this space because they could resolve some of the challenges around interface design (mentioned earlier). Additionally, future areas for growth in this sphere include in-home robotics that would help older adults with daily living activities or the use of holographic/interactive video consoles that could connect physical therapists and doctors to recovering patients in the home, better facilitating physical therapy following a procedure (such as a hip or knee replacement). Despite the seemingly large potential benefits of these technologies, there will probably not be a big push by city or state governments to develop policies requiring or incentivizing them anytime soon. Larger scale implementation will most likely be championed by healthcare insurance companies as more studies reveal potential health savings from these technologies. For example, Fallon Health, a Massachusetts-based health insurer and care provider, did a 12 month pilot study where they developed a passive remote monitoring system for seniors and demonstrated cost savings of $687 per member per month as a result of the program, which equated to about $8000 in savings per year. Initial results from studies that evaluate smart home technology for older adults point to a golden opportunity to achieve what’s known as the healthcare triple aim: improving the patient experience of care; improving the health of populations; and reducing the per capita cost of health care. One of the primary tenants of former President Obama’s Affordable Care Act was reducing healthcare costs through technological innovation, whether that be in healthcare delivery, electronic medical records, or new prevention programs. With funding and research support from places like the Innovation Center within the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, we are beginning to see progress on these goals. However, in light of recent federal action by the new administration and Republican-led Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, many of these gains and efforts to reduce costs could be lost. For this reason and many more, it is absolutely vital that consideration be given to the most vulnerable among us that could be adversely affected by massive changes to our healthcare system. Jessica Mathew ▷ Housing Resilience Through Adaptability Posted on April 7, 2017 For the first time in decades, more people are moving into New York City than leaving and the population of every borough is increasing. Over the past five years, New York City’s population has grown at the fastest rate since the 1920s, adding 375,000 new residents. By 2040, the City projects that the population will reach 9 million, an all-time high, putting a strain on our housing supply and driving up rents. More than half of New Yorkers are rent-burdened, meaning that they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Income inequality is also rising with nearly half of the city’s population now living at or near the poverty threshold. Simultaneously, the realities of climate change require that we protect our city, and particularly coastal areas from rising sea levels and natural disasters. Hurricane Sandy brought the city’s climate vulnerabilities to light, causing $19 billion in damages with a flood inundation zone that encompassed approximately 300,000 homes and 23,000 businesses. These phenomena necessitate careful consideration of not only increasing housing supply, but also the footprint of that housing. Though some segments of the city’s coastal areas are becoming increasingly precarious for residential uses, the waterfront can also continue to be home to some of the New York’s most vibrant communities through innovative thinking and the deployment of novel building technologies. The outlined multipronged approach unlocks the potential for a planning and construction process that is coordinated and timely, more agile and reconfigurable, quick to deploy, and scalable. Resilience improvements are inherent, while improved affordability is a secondary result of decreasing stress on the housing market by increasing flexibility and thereby the number of housing units that could be compatible to a given resident or household. Though there are challenges to implementing this strategy broadly in the city, there are undoubted benefits that New Yorkers could reap by repurposing existing homes to meet evolving needs. Adaptable housing technology presents an opportunity for New Yorkers in coastal communities to build flexibility into their homes that will maximize affordability and resilience by enabling evolving use over time. Broadly defined as housing that can adjust to changing technological needs and environmental patterns, adaptable housing represents a departure from traditional notions of housing structures as static and the potential to build affordability and resilience in housing stock by reducing the rigidity of the built environment. The potential of adaptable housing in New York City Adaptable housing has appeared in New York City in many forms, primarily for social and economic reasons. For example, the practice of adding walls or temporary dividers to split rooms has long been an informal means of adapting spaces to accommodate a growing family or to increase occupancy for cost-savings. However, advances in adaptable building technologies could now also be utilized for increased housing resiliency, including for single and multi-family buildings. New construction techniques, alternative materials and innovative technologies enable us to retrofit old, and design new, buildings and structures to withstand the current and predicted impacts of climate change. Using a combination of pre-fabrication, modular construction, and technologies for sensing and actuation, there is potential to broaden the areas being considered for housing development, while maintaining the safety and well-being of New Yorkers. Pre-fabrication methodologies have higher precision, lower cost, and faster speed of construction than traditional in-situ construction and have been used successfully for residential uses in Scandinavia and Japan. However, in the United States, pre-fabrication has tended largely toward commercial development. Modular construction provides a standardized interface for different building components that are built upon a baseline chassis that includes all required mechanical and electrical subsystems. Varying components can be assembled onto the chassis to either reconfigure existing components or add additional building components as required for expansion. These components can be shifted at relatively low-cost in response to evolving climate conditions or household changes. For example, a growing family whose home faces increasing risks from sea-level rise could have the opportunity to shift modular room components from the ground floor to higher elevations, while also adding an additional bedroom. This not only has implications with respect to resilience, but also affordability with inherent cost-savings in avoided real estate transactions and built-in customization tailored to unique needs. Modularizing building components allows for low-cost disassembly and reconfiguration, allowing not only for climate resilience, but the adaptability for changing household needs as a family evolves. Finally, integrating state-of-the art sensing and actuation technologies to control building systems can enable quick understanding and response to changing household needs and environmental conditions. These technologies have the potential to aid the management of multi-family buildings by enabling the monitoring of short and long-term environmental trends through the installation of building-specific and neighborhood-based sensors. Having complete information about the risk and frequency of flood events would allow the proprietors of multi-family buildings to plan ahead for any necessary building modifications. Furthermore, real-time sensing data during climate events can assist in triggering automated actuation of mechanical resilience measures such as watertight barriers on ground-levels. Adaptable housing in context: Far Rockaway Far Rockaway is uniquely positioned amongst New York City’s neighborhoods to benefit greatly from the implementation of adaptable housing technology at scale. Downtown Far Rockaway has been the focus of recent planning initiatives to promote both economic development and the production of affordable housing. Simultaneously, a vast portion of larger Far Rockaway, including primarily residential area falls within the flood plain. In order for plans for Downtown Far Rockaway to fully come to fruition and meet their envisioned potential, the future resilience of residential development in the immediate surrounding areas must be carefully considered. A vision for downtown Far Rockaway by the NYC Economic Development Corporation Dwelling units in Far Rockaway are comprised of mostly 1 to 2-family attached and detached units with low-rise multi-family residences distributed throughout. This low-density development necessitates an approach to adaptable housing technology that is uniquely straightforward within the city, as many residents own their homes and have relative autonomy over modifications to building structures. Housing typologies in Far Rockaway (Jessica Mathew) New construction aligning with the typical building typology in Far Rockaway could be modularized to increase flexibility of use on the ground floor and improve the ability for homes to evolve with changing sea-level conditions. Meanwhile, existing structures could be retrofitted within sensing and actuation technology to protect critical utility systems, which are often located on the ground floor of the home. Modular housing conceptual diagram (by Greg Keeffe and Ian McHugh, Queens University Belfast) Challenges However, in order to deploy these building systems broadly in New York City, we must carefully consider the risks of reliance on such technology. There are many considerations involved in creating an appropriate regulatory environment that enables the city to reap benefits while protecting the well-being of residents. Historically, informal adaptation of dwellings has facilitated overcrowding conditions motivated by cost-savings. This creates tremendous public health hazards, particularly from the perspective of the Fire Department which compiles detailed data on building materials, floorplans, and occupancy to respond to fire emergencies. If flexible building technologies are adopted in New York City, the municipal government would have to carefully consider how to track building changes for health and safety. Another challenge would be building sufficient flexibility into zoning regulations to allow for sufficient variances within given bounds. This is already beginning to take place in buildings that use permanent building technology to vacate a ground floor, but must be streamlined for application with more temporary building components. Looking ahead There are many potential benefits to putting a policy framework into place to oversee and support adaptable housing technology for improved housing resilience and adaptability in New York City’s coastal communities. By coordinating with private firms to better understand the future of adaptable housing technology, the City will be better equipped to develop a robust policy framework across City agencies including the Department of City Planning, Department of Buildings, and Department of Housing Preservation and Development."

New York Hates You: Trump and the Occupation of Fifth Avenue’s Public Space Posted on April 7, 2017 November 9, 2016: the day after the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Sixth street became ground zero for a roiling protest that seemed to spring straight from the collective id of a city knocked flat. New Yorkers poured from subways and office buildings, fueled by anger, grief, disbelief, and the drive to show what could only be shown collectively: the city’s wholesale rejection of the President-Elect. Their destination was Trump Tower, whose looming, opaque black glass stood in contrast to the small-d democratic human expression unfurling below. That day, Fifth Avenue became a new public space – packed with bodies, hashtagged, and forever changed in its city’s collective memory. Protests outside of Trump Tower on November 9, the day after the 2016 Presidential election. (Wikimedia Commons) By the inauguration, the streets and sidewalks surrounding the tower were reconfigured as a makeshift security zone, whose impenetrability was indicated by Jersey barriers, the architecture of accidental permanence. Secret Service agents, heavily armed NYPD officers, and private security guards staffed checkpoints at the perimeter. Fifty-Sixth Street was indefinitely closed to traffic. Gawkers and selfie-takers, bearing middle fingers or red baseball caps, became as permanent a fixture of the streetscape as its lightposts. The street had transformed once again: in both physicality and meaning, it had left its ordinary state through a chaos defined by public sentiment, before being reclaimed as a security space, public in name only. “The right of people from all parts of society to meet their fellow-citizens in the public space is a basic pillar of democracy.” — Jan Gehl “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters.” — Donald Trump New York’s street design is pragmatic above all else. A Manhattan street is a public place designed for function, not expression, for efficient commerce and egress, not specifically for public gathering. Fifth Avenue, one of New York City’s most identifiable public spaces, is not known as a palette for public dissent. Although it’s “bustling” — the most Manhattan of qualities — it’s less an agora than a utilitarian thoroughfare and a shopping district. In the mental map of the city, it’s most synonymous with high-caliber consumption, material desire, and upward-mobility tourism. What does it mean when such a narrow definition of “public” is blown up by mass protest, and then further narrowed through security protocol? Before November 9: An increasingly private public space As a public space in Midtown Manhattan, Fifth Avenue before November 2016 was far from simply “public.” Its five lanes of downtown-bound traffic are flanked by wide, sidewalks on which pedestrian traffic is heavy but commerce, from flashy advertising to sidewalk vending, is dominant. As is common in Midtown, the line between public and private space has long been blurred here. Sidewalk-adjacent public plazas can seem insincere attempts to accommodate theoretical gathering, while somewhat hidden Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) are tucked into the atriums of office towers. Both are nominally public concessions built by developers in exchange for a height variance, and they are typically treated as afterthoughts. The POPS within Trump Tower (whose context and meaning is expertly dissected by Karrie Jacobs in Architect Magazine) is a badly-marked labyrinth of atrium-level space with minimal seating, and often-closed balconies on higher floors. The poor signage and limited amenities of this space represent the rule, rather than the exception, for Midtown POPS. Privately owned public space in Trump Tower (Wikimedia Commons) This stretch of Fifth Avenue is one of the “great walks” of Manhattan; its intact streetwall, consistent activity and reliable spectacle make it a tourist attraction. It’s long been known as a destination for both window shopping and actual commerce. Both are transactional public activities, with private enterprise defining the parameters of expected and accepted behavior. Whether providing the entertainment or the actual goods, the department stores, chain stores, and boutiques of Fifth Avenue determine the primary use of the sidewalk. In summer months, some even open their doors and provide air-conditioning and music to the sidewalk, literally blurring the atmosphere between public and private. And this forefronting of the private sector is no accident: the Fifth Avenue BID has been working since the 1990s with more than 150 retailers to keep Fifth Avenue from 46th to 61st Street “clean, safe and welcoming,” provide “supplemental security and sanitation services,” and assist tourists along this commercial strip. As is typical in high-value commercial districts, security and surveillance infrastructure are pervasive. Heavy concrete planter barriers and bollards delineate property lines and define street-level public plazas. A line of barrier planters has stood outside Trump Tower for more than a decade. The district has a visible police presence, including regularly-placed NYPD officers directing traffic. The Fifth Avenue BID employs “Community Safety Officers,” private security staff who double as tourist ambassadors and provide an additional visual symbol of public security. When the officers first hit the street in 1993, then-Mayor Giuliani called it “emblematic of the type of public/private cooperation that yields a win-win-win situation. Communities win, businesses win, all New Yorkers win.” Trump Tower from the curb (Google Streetview) The omnipresence of surveillance cameras, though a visible and expected aspect of public urban life, is more difficult to quantify. New York City does not publish the number or location of public or private cameras, although according to most experts, it has risen dramatically in the past two decades. A study by the New York Surveillance Camera Project estimated that visible surveillance cameras on Fifth Avenue in Midtown more than quadrupled in just the year and a half following the September 11 attacks. The New York Civil Liberties Union found that the percentage of surveillance cameras in public spaces in New York rose by 443 percent from 1998 to 2010, and has counted more than 2,400 known public cameras in Manhattan alone. London, which does make its numbers public, has more than 500,000. Speaking on the increasing pervasiveness of both mounted and drone-based surveillance cameras, Mayor Michael Bloomberg told the Daily News in 2013, “We’re going to have more visibility and less privacy. I don’t see how you stop that.” For many New Yorkers, assumed surveillance is increasingly a fact of public life, and a small price to pay for security. November 9: Emergence of the unruly Fifth Avenue Even before the 2016 election, the public street and sidewalks of Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Sixth Streets had grown in symbolic significance in the city’s consciousness. Small but fierce flash-protests, organized largely through Twitter and Facebook, had become increasingly frequent during the campaign. Anonymous organizers of actions such as the October 16 “blockade” by women protesting Trump over recently-leaked admissions of sexual assault, mobilized, publicized, and documented their actions through Twitter personas such as @PussyGrabsBack (joined October 2016). Women’s March on January 21- the day after the Presidential Inauguration (Annemarie Gray via Twitter) Taking a page from leaderless, social media-driven movements such as the Arab Spring and Occupy, these actions seemed to focus not on getting tens of thousands of participants, but on mobilizing as quickly as possible and disseminating information in real time to affect the news cycle. In effect, these 21st century tactics take an expanded view of the public realm, and public protest, considering online space an equally crucial front for resistance. A meaningful protest movement, it seemed, didn’t require a lot of bodies in the street, but did require a lot of eyeballs. In the weeks leading up to the election, with more than 90% of Manhattan voters planning on pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton, a Trump victory seemed like a remote and unserious possibility. While NYPD and private security presence had been ramped up at the tower in the final weeks of the campaign, there had been little public or media discussion of the possible impact of four years of Secret Service-level security on either public space or the city’s budget. The inconvenience of security infrastructure on Fifth Avenue appeared temporary, and New Yorkers were used to temporary inconveniences. It is difficult to overstate the shock felt in New York on the evening of November 8. That evening, much of the real-time initial reaction – the disbelief, the desperate calculations, the anger — took place on social media, our most immediate public realm. But November 9, a cold and rainy day, brought the online reaction into physical space, as waves of protestors headed to Fifth Avenue. The thousands of participants in the first post-election protests had not planned, scheduled, or permitted their participation. Facebook events had been hastily created early Wednesday morning, and many saw images of the growing crowd on Twitter before heading out. Others just knew they would not be alone if they went. The public space at Fifth and Fifty-Sixth had taken on a new urgency overnight; the map of Manhattan in the city’s collective consciousness had undergone a shocking update. Police outside of Protests on November 9- Election day (Reuters) Even outside the current reality that crowd-size estimates equate to political clout, it’s difficult to quantify the number of protestors outside of Trump Tower in the two days following the election. Estimates generally range in the several-thousands in Manhattan. Similar unplanned, unpermitted, fast-breaking mobilizations occurred in cities across the country, and around the world. Much like the Women’s Marches and airport protests that followed in January, these distributed protests’ simultaneousness and unified imagery, made possible by social media, were a source of strength for participants. For twenty-four hours, Fifth Avenue was uncharacteristically unruly. The Trump Tower protests were self-organized, spontaneous, un-permitted, and emotionally charged. Although largely peaceful, sixty-five protestors were arrested on November 9, on charges including “disorderly conduct” and “blocking vehicular traffic.” However, at a certain point in the evening, the NYPD, a police force well-versed in crowd control, seemed to give in to the crush of protestors determined to occupy space outside the Tower, and as long as they remained peaceful, made few attempts to control their flow. The snapshot of Fifth Avenue immediately following the election was as genuine a public expression of the right to public space as is possible in a highly-securitized, heavily surveilled and psuedo-privatized environment like Midtown Manhattan. The frequent speculation about whether we’re entering a “new era of perpetual protest” is often rendered in optimistic surprise; but what are our public spaces for if not for democratic expression? And does the fact that this expression, in public space, seems so anomalous indicate how far our public spaces have drifted from their purpose? A few weeks later: Barriers up By the end of November, the bulk of the initially-visible public outpouring of anguish had moved from Trump Tower to a more recognizable twenty-first century agora: the internet. The resistance took on other forms besides bodies in the street. Larger, more organized actions, such as the Women’s March, were planned. Estimates were assembled regarding the cost to the city of securing Trump Tower for the next four years. Mayor Bill de Blasio feuded with Trump in the tabloids about this cost. The President-elect did little to ingratiate himself to those who had shown up to protest his election, his fellow New Yorkers. Meanwhile, several rows of metal pedestrian barriers went up around Trump Tower, essentially privatizing the sidewalk. 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was entirely closed to traffic, and security checkpoint booths appeared at the intersections behind high-speed crash barriers. Three traffic lanes were barricaded off, two for a security buffer and one across the street for a semi-permanent pen for journalists and photographers keeping tabs on visitors to the tower. The new “temporary” security infrastructure invoked permanence in the same fashion as much of Lower Manhattan following September 11. New Yorkers seemed to know what to expect, and the loss of a small sliver of public space in an already questionably-public district seemed to pale in comparison to fears of what the new administration would bring. Security infrastructure around Trump Tower (New York Times) Physical public space restrictions aside, the site continued to feature significantly in the city’s collective self image. As the Trump name was being removed from the residential towers on Riverside Drive across town, commercial tenants in Trump Tower and adjacent buildings complained of a drastic decline in foot traffic and a drop in sales. Mayor de Blasio was quoted in the press as saying “I will not tell you that Gucci and Tiffany are my central concerns in life.” However clumsy, this sentiment is telling in its opposition to the fundamental identity of Fifth Avenue, a place that has been more or less defined by high-value commerce. Also, by the end of Trump Tower had developed its own online persona. Geotagged Instagram posts from the tower contained hundreds of individual expressions of on-location disdain, far outnumbering positive imagery of the location. The raising of a middle finger at a skyscraper might only last a moment in physical space, but its online life is long. In late November, an online “vandal” changed the building’s name in Google Maps to Dump Tower. But the barriers remained up, the visible opposition on-location continued to dwindle, and commuters learned to avoid the security snag as if it were any other obstacle to New York efficiency. Whose streets? Public space carries within it a fundamental tension. On one hand it requires predictability to function. Collective orderliness is the assumption that allows us all to surround ourselves with strangers, to commute on transit, to live and to work stacked floor upon floor, to consume at a steady rate without running out of things to consume. Yet on the other hand, by definition public space invites some degree of chaos. People are unpredictable, and public spaces can be visible showcases for the chaos and expression that makes us human. We are constitutionally granted freedom of assembly, but street design, visible security and surveillance, public-private management agreements, collective memory, and social norms can all contribute to that freedom being exercised infrequently. In order to satisfy egress and commerce, Fifth Avenue, and other commerce-oriented public spaces require that human unpredictability be kept to a minimum. Fifth Avenue was never intended for mass demonstrations. It’s not a marketplace of ideas, it’s a marketplace, and it evidently takes a global-scale systemic shock like November 8 to shift that ingrained identity, even for a few days. Protests outside of JFK after the Travel Ban Executive Order was signed (Wikimedia Commons) If we are indeed headed into a new era of mass demonstration, what does that mean for public space? For one thing, the era is likely to be defined by an uneasy and quickly evolving hybrid of online and offline mobilization that will be impossible to accommodate with public space design alone. Rather than Fifth Avenue, the spontaneous immigration ban protests at airports nationwide are perhaps a truer manifestation of this new kind of public assembly. They did not take place in traditional, designated public gathering spaces. Diffuse, immediate, reactionary and viral, it was their speed, their number, and their imageability that made them powerful. It’s difficult to imagine this power coming from a demonstration in even the most thoughtfully-designed public plaza. If there is a silver lining to the decades-long trend of encroachment on public space of security, surveillance and commercial infrastructure like that surrounding Trump Tower, it’s that our definition of public spaces is broadening beyond the physical to the virtual and the temporal. The tower may now lay claim to some additional real estate, but public expression can now organize in a flash, multiply with a click, and live in a collective memory supported by digital connection. Ifeoma Ebo ▷ Designing Just Spaces Posted on April 7, 2017 The public street is often the stage for all facets of public life. Right of ways house festivals and markets, childhood games, criminal activity, public surveillance, meaningful engagements between neighbors, and provide a space of safe passage for residents and visitors. In essence our streets are spaces for the projection of democratic ideals and discriminatory practices. The purpose of this essay is to explore how certain technological investments in public streets can either reveal layers of injustice, connect people to their civic duties in partnership with government or allow engagement between people and their local businesses. “Streets and their sidewalks – the main public place of a city – are its most vital organs.” — Jane Jacobs In order to ground this research in reality, this essay explores the connection between the public street and urban justice along the stretch of Mother Gaston Boulevard between Livonia and East New York Avenue in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Mother Gaston Boulevard was selected for this analysis because of its unique composition. The majority of the public housing in Brownsville is situated along the Boulevard alongside other public assets, presenting an opportunity for impact through public action. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments along Mother Gaston Boulevard account for nearly 20 percent of all violent crime in public housing. According to CompStat, an online crime management tool for New York City Police Department (NYPD), 2016 statistics various intersections along Mother Gaston Boulevard have been the sites of numerous assaults, shootings and robberies. This is an unfortunate fate for a street that is named after an important historic figure for the community. Entry to NYCHA housing on Mother Gaston Boulevard (Ifeoma Ebo) Rosetta “Mother” Gaston was a community activist who dedicated her life to community work and teaching Black children about their heritage. She founded the Heritage House – a community center on the second floor of the Stone Avenue Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, located on the corner of Mother Gaston Blvd and Dumont Avenue. A mural of Mother Gaston was painted on the corner of Pitkin Avenue to honor her legacy, which today serves as a gateway to the beloved Boulevard. View on Mother Gaston Boulevard to Pitkin Avenue Technology and the design process In an interview with Justin Garrett Moore, Executive Director of the Public Design Commission and Adjunct Professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, he discussed the explicit connection between the design, programming, operation, management and policing of public streets, and the people that use, have access to and/or rights to use the streets. Moore connects the advent of tech tools to the socially impactful transformation of the design profession. The purpose of a designer has been recalibrated and is evolving more out of a process of discovering how people connect to place than to the traditional process of site analysis, schematic design, design development.” With the advent of Building Information Management and other digital imaging tools the experience of designing a street has become more efficient, leaving designers with greater capacity to explore ways of engaging communities in collaborative problem solving through design. Additionally, the evidence of an “unjust” design process can be tangibly demonstrated in a built environment that does not connect or relate to the needs of the people that use it. Brooklyn Moving Forward Mural depicting Rosetta “Mother” Gaston (Ifeoma Ebo) Technology and the participatory design process The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) is using CoUrbanize, an online community engagement platform, to invite residents to participate in the agency’s Brownsville Neighborhood Planning Process. Founded in 2013 by graduates of MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, CoUrbanize is geared towards people who want to participate in their community’s planning but may not have time or schedule flexibility to attend a meeting. From the comfort of their cell phones, residents in Brownsville can either visit the online platform and provide feedback or contribute to a text messaging service where they can voice ideas that aren’t on the city’s radar. The holistic approach that HPD is taking to decrease vacant space, activate corridors and improve mobility seems to encourage a just process that empowers residents. The CoUrbanize Platform Using a technology-based approach acknowledges that many Brownsville residents use these tools as their primary form of engagement within their social networks, relevant organizations and the outside world. In an effort to promote resident participation in the physical design of streets, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the Street Ambassador program in 2015. DOT brings outreach directly to New Yorkers by setting up mobile information stations where DOT projects are being considered or have been implemented to collect ideas and input. According to Patrick Smith, an Urban Designer at DOT, “Street ambassadors are effective because of the use of technology. They use a survey app that makes it more efficient to collect information from locals and store it on a database.” In addition, this database can quickly produce graphs and other visual tools based on the data collected to support the development of policy and planning strategies. Similar to the coUrbanize tool used by HPD, DOT has created their own interactive map where people can post location specific comments. Patrick believes this holistic approach to community engagement technology “provides a midpoint between a community meeting and canvassing the street – it decreases the barriers to obtaining public feedback.” NYCDOT Feedback Portal For DOT, public safety is composed of many interconnected parts. Focus on pedestrian safety from vehicular traffic is connected to the improvement of safety from criminal activity. As people feel safer to physically cross the street, they feel more comfortable to walk in the neighborhood and this in effect increases the natural surveillance of the street. However, in the context of Brownsville some residents do not feel safe walking on the streets not because of fear of vehicular traffic, but the fear of discrimination by law enforcement. Technology and the pedestrian experience In an interview with Natural Langdon, a Brownsville raised film director, he raises the point that Brownsville streets are a place where youth are conditioned to being physically violated by law enforcement. Grabbed, frisked, and perhaps even taken into custody, their identity transforms on the street: they are criminalized. Natural Langdon on Mother Gaston Boulevard This treatment can imprint on the mind of a young child that the public street is a place where they do not belong. This stigmatization of youth in Brownsville is further exacerbated by the presence of NYPD security cameras on Mother Gaston Boulevard which insights fear rather than safety. According to Langdon, cameras on the street create feelings of being monitored and controlled, a loss of privacy, freedom and ownership – not only for criminals, but for the greater community as well. In Langdon’s childhood, Mother Gaston Boulevard was more often perceived as a space for the amplification of bad activity as opposed to the celebration of the good. However, to address these issues he feels that “what is needed is a safe space for youth to be productive.” In response to this need for youth empowerment Quardean Lewis founded Made in Brownsville, a nonprofit that implements programs to empower youth through skills training and mentorship. For Lewis, an architect born and raised in Brownsville, the main challenges to justice along Mother Gaston Boulevard are between “access and power – the means to have an impact and define spaces and the authority to govern those spaces” do not belong to the people of Brownsville. These sentiments are evident in the fact that many of the businesses on Mother Gaston Boulevard, particularly in the stretch between Pitkin and Sutter Avenue, are not owned by residents. Businesses along Mother Gaston Boulevard This lack of prominent business ownership in Brownsville is unfortunate because the street is the place where community wealth is built as a space for business activity. Additionally, commercial wealth built in Brownsville is not connected to the people that live there. As a result, financial resources are not being recycled in the community. The public street can be a vehicle for the transformation of this paradigm. The connection to and ownership of a place is essential to how people, particularly street owners, treat the street. In response to this need for wealth building in Brownsville, Lewis is interested in working with his organization of youth to design and launch a new distribution network of touch screen interfaces along public streets that allow for communication between residents, local businesses and nonprofit organizations. Since many local entrepreneurs do not have the capacity to advertise on the street, these touch screens will allow them to reach pedestrians through technology. He hopes that this new tech tool can begin to address the inequity in economic empowerment in the neighborhood; however there remains a challenge to local access to economic power that is connected to limited private ownership along the Boulevard. NYPD security camera on Pitkin Avenue (Ifeoma Ebo) The presence of vacant lots in the community and on the Boulevard limits the impact that residents can have in the transformation of their community. There is no distinction between the treatment of land around the NYCHA developments and the underutilized or vacant lots in the community. This is troubling seeing that most of Mother Gaston Boulevard is lined with public housing on either side, creating an experience of walking through vacant land with no active street life. Lewis feels that due to limited local ownership and significant public land along Mother Gaston Boulevard, resulting in “too much authority given to the police over public space.” Residents are robbed of the opportunity to participate in the act of public safety and making decisions on how technology is used to address the nature of crime in their community. Technology and public safety on the street In response to street violence, the NYPD created CompStat, an online data-driven police accountability and management tool that geographically maps crime based on its closest proximity to street intersections. CompStat, uses technology that relies on just three historical variables to make its predictions: type of crime, place of crime, and time of day. This information can also be valuable in the process of street design to encourage solutions that further assist in reducing the unique type of crime based on geographic location. NYPD CompStat Platform In partnership with the NYPD and NYCHA, the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice took CompStat to another level by creating NeighborhoodStat – a data-driven participatory problem solving structure bringing together city government and residents to problem-solve public safety issues specific to each development. This initiative includes reviewing data and tracking outcomes to ensure that the City and its residents are able to evaluate progress in real time and deliver results. Amy Sananman, Executive Director of the Mayor’s Action Plan for Neighborhood Safety stressed the importance of the participatory process, “It’s important for law enforcement to build a relationship and a rapport with people in the community in order to create change.” Through the collaborative use of community crime data, the sense of ownership over addressing crime on public streets becomes a shared responsibility between residents and their local law enforcement. “You can have police presence without having police violence.” — Amy Sananman Aside from the advancement of the physical construction of streets, technology has also advanced the ability of the public to be involved in the design, development and control of activity on public streets. One of the major challenges to addressing perceptions of justice along Mother Gaston Boulevard is the fact that there are numerous public assets along the street that do not work collaboratively to provide a unified identity for this central corridor. This challenge also presents an opportunity for various city agencies to work together to create a street presence that is not dominated by underutilized land, but encourages the public to engage with the street in new ways. The use of technology can advance this agenda in the use of tools to encourage meaningful social interaction, information exchange and accessibility of government processes."

Mainstreaming Preservation Posted on April 7, 2017 Google Maps Community Preservation Layer sketch A recent article in the Guardian analyzed how technology could potentially make urban planning processes more transparent to the general public. In the article, a myriad of tools are mentioned- such as the CitySwipe and Flux Metro which bring future or proposed changes to a particular neighborhood or site to people’s fingertips for preview. Most of these tools aim to let residents comment or vote on proposed developments around their neighborhood. The article alludes to these tools being the Tinder of urban planning- imagine a tool where anyone could swipe right or left to approve or veto new developments in their neighborhood. One particular tool, UrbanPlanAR platform, even makes use of virtual reality so people can have an idea of what a specific project will look like within its real life context. In New York City, the amount of apps and tools built to better understand or interact with the built environment is growing. From the city-sponsored competition Big Apps, through New York Public Library Lab’s, OldNYC to maps featured in multiple news outlets, such as the shadow map recently posted in the New York Times. In this context, where we interact and operate in a city constantly evolving and changing at a rapid pace, where market forces stretch the limit of zoning and building codes, and the Department of City Planning, the Department of Landmark Preservation and other government agencies struggle to keep pace- what is the role for preservation? And, most importantly, how can the practice of historic preservation benefit from the use of technology, data, and readily available tools such as Google maps? Historic preservation – or preservation as it is now more commonly referred to- is now moving away from historical or cultural preservation, to the preservation of neighborhood character. Preservation is often understood as the practice that aims to protect, preserve, and conserve buildings, landscapes, or other elements that have historical significance. This proposal aims to expand the discussion as it relates to technology, people, and how we interact with our built environment. For this purpose we propose a new Google Maps Community Preservation Layer that allows communities to easily identify and document the buildings and uses they would like to preserve in their neighborhoods. Data can be gathered just as reviews and other data is gathered today in Google Maps – by people inputting their comments and ratings into a pre-established questionnaire format. Since no two sites are alike and no two communities are alike, we propose a framework that it is flexible enough to allow for communities to adjust the questions and data that would come out of it. As communities engage in this process, they generate the type of questions that would be useful for them. By being able to ask the right questions and having user-created content, preservation is taken out of the professional world and into the hands of concerned/interested citizens. Our proposed Google Maps Community Preservation Layer has the potential to redefine preservation processes and allow communities to define what their neighborhood character is and what assets are valuable to them. It can also change the way historic preservation is practiced today, and it could even shift traditional roles by placing an apparent responsibility on residents and community groups to make a case for their own historic preservation approach. Google Maps Community Preservation Layer: Preservation at your fingertips In today’s Google Map experience, places of interest are highlighted as commercial corridors and visualized in a different color. The Google Community Preservation Layer uses these same visual treatment to highlight certain areas of interest and allow users the ability to comment on particular places and buildings. Google Maps image showing Fulton Street and Lafayette Ave area in Brooklyn with areas of interest highlighted in beige The Community Preservation Layer can be activated following these steps: A decision by a community group and/or other stakeholders that a certain area warrants preservation or seems threatened by rapid development An area of interest for community preservation is defined on the map and the community preservation layer is activated on Google Maps As information is collected, it lives in Google Maps and anyone browsing on Google Maps or visiting those neighborhoods could have a glimpse at how those communities view themselves and what elements are important for them Once an area of preservation has been defined, and a community group has tailored the questionnaire to their needs, visitors and online browsers can input a review and rate forms or uses important to them as well Google Maps Preservation Layer process and stakeholder map The Google Map Community Preservation Layer would allow for communities to easily gather and/or identify the buildings, uses, or economics they like in their neighborhoods. It is flexible enough to let communities tailor their inquiries and data collection methods to reflect what they care the most about and what they think makes their community special– in some cases it will be about the built environment, in others it could be about the possibilities enabled by the urban configuration, in yet other cases it could be about the affordability or an existing employment network. Building off the Google Maps traits, this layer could serve as an example of how existing technology can be leveraged to promote preservation, collect data on the ground, and allow communities –or other users- to input and in turn, use relevant data. Case Study: Gowanus Google Maps as it is illustrates the Gowanus Canal area today The Gowanus neighborhood in Brooklyn is undergoing rapid change. A recently completed community driven plan, called “Bridging Gowanus” together with a recently launched Neighborhood Planning Study by the NYC Department of City Planning has spurred some speculations as to the future of the neighborhood. There are many civic and community organizations operating in Gowanus with multiple agendas and visions on what they would like to see happen in the future. So how can these organizations collaborate and conduct outreach in a more streamlined manner? How can they reach more residents? How can they communicate with other city and state agencies on what is most important to constituents? How can they shape the changing future without running the risk of stifling future growth of the neighborhood? The Google Map Community Preservation Layer can help multiple stakeholders have a source of information that is collective and easy to access. Gowanus on Google Maps with the Preservation Layer activated In the image above, a “community preservation” area is shown in light red just like current commercial areas of are shown is light beige. This layer could be turned on and off on the left navigation bar. This area in pink can be highlighted to reflect the community’s priorities as they relate to historic preservation and neighborhood character. Preserving form through collective choice The BRT powerhouse, built in 1902, also known as the “Bat Cave” was once the home of the former Brooklyn Rapid Transit Powerhouse. It was a coal-fired plant that powered Brooklyn’s trolley system. The building has been abandoned since the turn of the 21st century and has housed squatters and celebrated graffiti. BRT Powerhouse, September 2016 It is a very prominent building in Gowanus and is considered by the community as an asset to be reused for a community benefit. In recent years there has been much speculation about the feasibility of the building’s future. However, this information is only available to those who specifically know about the history or are searching specifically for the subject matter. When searching in Google Maps, there is no indication of the historic significance of the building. Google Maps Community Preservation Layer on: The BRT Powerhouse (highlighted) is now a Google Maps entry with information and rating as to its history and importance to residents With the proposed tool, an organization like The Historic District Council for example, who included Gowanus and more specifically the BRT Powerhouse building in their Six to Celebrate Program, can now spread the word and include the building in a newly created Community Preservation Layer where they can upload historic images of the building, have the public rate it based on certain attributes, ask for a vote to save it and include links to relevant sites. More recent updates on the possible development of this site include an article in the NY times which revealed that the building will be renovated and expanded to house “a factory for the production of art” could also be incorporated into the newly created entry. Through this layer residents and community groups can now comment on the potential future use of the BRT Powerhouse and advocate for changes in the proposed scheme. The inclusion of these types of entries could also help residents learn more about their neighborhood and what their neighbors care most about. Preserving programs through collective choice Brooklyn News Building, September 2016 More recently, some areas in Gowanus emerged as clusters of certain activities such as gyms, climbing walls, and other type of exercise-related activities. Degraw Street, for example, became a street which attracted uses focused on physical activities. These buildings used to house industrial uses, and their open floor plans allowed for easy conversion. With the proposed land use changes in the Gowanus Neighborhood Plan currently underway, the Google Map Community Preservation Layer could help these business owners and local residents communicate the significance gyms hold in this changing neighborhood fabric for their neighborhood character. Degraw street view with a Community Preservation Layer on The new visual identity could make it into the public realm and draw a connection from the online tool to local residents. This type of augmented reality helps inform all stakeholders of the significance of the place and help them participate in the consultation/preservation process. Existing Screenshot: Google Maps showing the area of Degraw Street as shown today illustrative the cluster of uses highlighted in beige Google Maps Community Preservation Layer on: The pink area shows the community preservation area of interest, through which community residents and others can see the specific questions or data prompts, and input their reviews and comments for particular buildings and uses An agent of change for preservation One of the main challenges in New York City’s changing landscape is dealing with both the negative aspects associated with change and the technical process involved in preserving the built environment. The Google Map Community Preservation Layer aims to bridge this divide, by making preservation an accessible process and allowing for a community-led process to influence development forces. If we acknowledge that constant change is the city’s trademark, preservation becomes more complicated. Since the Google Map Community Preservation Layer is embedded into everyday life, it can be reshaped from the scale of the individual to the scale of whole neighborhoods. The Google Map Community Preservation Layer empowers citizens to identify those buildings and uses that they value most and wish to maintain, while at the same time creates enough content that developers and city officials could use to inform their planning processes. However, The Google Map Community Preservation Layer can raise valid questions as to who are the users entering the data, how closely related are they to the community at question and at what point has an area of interest collected enough data to represent a collective choice. Another question raised is the potential for this data to be manipulated and used at the algorithmic level by Google or others. Even though the tool might have drawbacks, having a tool such as this one could be especially useful at a time when a neighborhood is undergoing changes that might be perceived differently by the various neighborhood constituents. Today, when government agencies are constantly in search of innovative ways to engage communities, using this type of tool to empower community residents could allow for communities to be more involved in the planning and preservation processes and shape various development outcomes. Alan Waxman ▷ A New Kind of Hospital Room Posted on April 7, 2017 In the spring of 2017, Brookdale Hospital in Brownsville, Brooklyn, will unveil a new kind of hospital room: projections of key street scenes will unfold on the walls of the room along with a complex musical beat. The street scenes have been recorded by high risk participants; in this case, young men at risk for gang violence. Projections take viewers down the street at a walking pace while beats correlate with geospatial data streams, integrating factors like storefront occupation, pedestrian use, violence rate, and socioeconomic data. As participants take in the scene and follow this journey through their neighborhood projected on the walls of the hospital room, wearable sensors capture vital signs of anxiety in breath and heart rate. As anxiety increases in the room – such as when the scene approaches areas of illicit activity or rival territory – the video slows, eventually to a freeze frame, where participants are asked to relate to the scene with freestyle commentary. This is also an opportunity for particularly skilled practitioners to mediate that anxiety through their artistic engagement practice. The project proposes a new kind of medicine based in the way people interpret their urban spaces. As various user and patient groups focus on and engage with key areas, the spatialized data compiled becomes a measurement of human value in the city. This new paradigm of psychosocial medicine to be deployed in Brookdale has been precipitated by three shifts in contemporary technology: Shift from clinical studies of control based cause and effect to big data ecology and multivariable analysis Shift from machine learning and artificial intelligence computational systems to real time intelligent biophysical systems with embodied feedback in points of vulnerability Shift from treatment of individuals in imagined isolation to psychosocial therapy with a group in situ with collective imagination. Although the installation at Brookdale is predicated on all three, the third shift is directly demonstrated in the project, intertwining the fields of medicine and urban design. With near instant feedback now available on an urban scale, it is increasingly important to develop rigorous methodologies that generate key psychosocial data streams in sensitive points of urban vulnerability as well as therapies that will manipulate those data streams in meaningful ways. This is the work of the Urban Rhythms studios. Urban Rhythms Studios: In Brownsville from 2015 to the present In Spring 2015, a group of 10 Brownsville youth presented a complex map of perceived risk due to potential gun violence in the Marcus Garvey Village (MGV) to Kenneth Frampton, the architect who designed the development 42 years prior. Over the course of ten weeks Ionna Jimenez and myself held discussions with the participants through the Brownsville Community Justice Center. Jayquane and Myaliah explain their social architectures to designer Kenneth Frampton (Quardean Lewis) Thanks to the forethought of coordinators Erica Mateo and Deron Johnston, Jimenez and myself were given complete freedom to discuss issues that the participants thought were most pressing: often circling back to the potential of violent confrontation with oppositional gangs. As a final project, each participant identified a spatial spectrum of perceived risk in night and day, on various days of the week, and at various times of the year. These maps were aggregated together, illustrating exactly how the peculiar architecture of the MGV effects the way people’s lives are lived on a daily basis. The maps become a topography of human perception, where physical spaces are assessed by their risk to materialize violence, intensified by one’s identification with the territory. The intimate cul-de-sacs or “mews” of the MGV offer particularly localized defensible spaces in which residents identify. Whereas Frampton designed the MGV as an intimate departure in social housing from configurations of public space typified by the early 20th century Ville Radieuse and 19th century notions of cleansing air and light, the maps created by the young Brownsvillians offer a critique again – this time one in which a shifting real time chorography of perception begs for a kind of architecture that is a social choreography: a time based urban design that takes advantage of big data and adaptive management feedback in the living neighborhood system. Along with the maps, we designed a recreation center, built in the Marcus Garvey Village in 2016 with the help of Tricia Martin and Kaja Kühl. The “built” space is less significant than the living landscape architecture envisioned by the group, a methodology that has implications for the way social problems are treated in general. This landscape architecture of psychosocial health presents a shift in the method of treatment of wrongdoing from punishing an individual in terms of their personal transgression, to creating collective therapies in psychosocial context. In the older framework, an individual transgressor may be on the receiving end of society’s externalities, or in other words the “deck may be stacked against him.” Because he has broken the law, the force of that law must come down equally upon him as it would on any other person anywhere. Enlightenment values of measurable equanimity are here transposed through harsh punishment as the transgressor becomes an example for society. He is made the picture of deviance reifying societal norms and rule of law. His body is removed and confined. Rather than removal of the “problem” population, the psychosocial therapy methodology becomes a way to work with embedded human value tied to the street and its existing social networks. What Urban Rhythms proposes is to address the culpability of the context. This context is created most directly by the people who live it, exemplified by the young people in the Marcus Garvey Village who face the risk of potential gun violence daily. Therefore, it is their collective imagination that has the highest likelihood of changing their lived landscape. Real time data integration and practice: rapping and flexing The method is not new. Urban Rhythms builds on collaborative strategies developed in existing Afro-American traditions of psychosocial therapy. In this project rapping and flex dancing are deployed in the institutional therapeutic setting of the hospital room as a psychosocial health urban design strategy. Collaborator Tameel Marshall describes how the rapping environment plays with neighborhood data in terms of “beat,” “instrumentality,” and “lyricism.” Essentially time, scale, and meaning in practice: “Beat is the rate or the beats per minute, the metronome, breath, activity in a day, the ability for actions to take place, data, police phone calls, Facebook data, drop-out rate. It is the way slaves would communicate beyond words, the angle of perspective, the power of persuasion. It plays a big role in how something is perceived, whether a song captures the feeling of ‘the street.’ Instrumentality is materials, tools, iron, guns, instruments, Google, Facebook, murals, stores, things they sell, garbage, chemicals, food, clothes, etc. Lyricism is meaning, criticism through ideas, words, and metaphors such as lies, African masks, images of the Vietnam war, desires to make it big and get out of Brownsville, etc. For example, if murder rate is the beat in question then instrumentality is who died, where, and the murder weapon. Lyricism would be why the person died. Resonance is created when beat, instrumentality and lyricism connect with each other and connect to your soul.” The word cipher is used by participants to describe this space that allows for the parsing of complex meanings and codes, in the moment, between various participants. The space and practice brings often contentious, high risk participants together for a collaborative synthesis. Collaborator Carl Belizaire describes how the flex dance cipher can resolve conflicts: “If you have animosity towards someone and you see them on the dance floor, this is your time to go head to head. You will see people bump into someone they have beef within what they call a cipher, which is a space where everyone is huddled up and taking turns giving everything they have, and they bump into you and you then have no choice but to go, to show this person that you are the best at what you do. People will be upset but in the end it doesn’t matter because you are just taking care of whatever they had on their chest.” Brookdale will be one of the first institutional hospital settings to deploy this psychosocial methodology. Because the very people who are most at risk in these spaces are also skilled in the methodologies of analysis, the hope is that participants will have the kind of skill and sensitivity that will reveal meaning layered in the streets of Brownsville and lead to adaptation of actions in their own lives on the street. Institutions offer the support and feedback that allows analysis to become actionable in urban systems. Over time, these groups will be supplemented by other groups in the hospital room: beat police officers, social workers, even resident doctors; each group adding a layer of confidential meaning in neighborhood interpretation. As these data sets will then be folded back into the stream of video and beat, instrumentality, and lyricism, participating groups will hopefully see and understand ways they can adjust their own lives in the neighborhood to address risk and prevent violence and disease. These aggregated “songs” have another benefit; by revealing the complex poetic value tied to health data within the spatial gestalt of the city streets, these spatial songs are significant demonstrations of the value of the street and its living community, beyond socioeconomic or violence data in isolation. The project is fiscally sponsored by Storefront for Art and Architecture, the New York State Council of the Arts, and the Mark Morris Dance Group, with support from the Brownsville Community Justice Center, MIT D Lab, and Three Black Cats Café.

Should the City Boost Private Transit Technology to Serve Red Hook? Posted on April 7, 2017 The Red Hook neighborhood in Brooklyn lacks quick access to the subway and has limited bus options. Those who live and work in Red Hook must utilize other means of accessing the neighborhood, most of which require multimodal connections. While the existing public transit options – bus and ferry – do allow people to move in and out of Red Hook, the trip time involved with these options can deter public transit use or add a significant time burden for those who have no alternative. Compounding the need for reliable, fast, and frequent transit is needed to connect Red Hook’s residential population with quality jobs; approximately 8,000 of Red Hook’s 11,000 residents live in NYCHA’s largest Brooklyn property, Red Hook Houses. The Brooklyn and Queens waterfront has exploded with real estate development and interest in the past 10 years, with areas that have quality transit connections leading the boom. Red Hook is no exception. Since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, development has increased in the neighborhood. Proposed and underway pipeline development, including Est4te Four’s 160 Imlay (residential), Red Hook Piers (manufacturing, hotel, retail), and Thor Equities’ proposed Red Hoek Point (office and retail), demonstrate market demand and interest in Red Hook. However, existing residents and business owners continue to voice their concerns about the long-term affordability and the changing character of Red Hook as a result of growing development interest in the neighborhood. Transit access and improved mobility will only serve to fuel market interest. Political context At face value, the mobility solution for Red Hook would be for the City and State to invest in quality public transit in the neighborhood, but the likelihood of this investment is unclear. In February 2016, Mayor de Blasio announced the Brooklyn-Queens Connector (“BQX”); a $2.5 billion streetcar that will run from Sunset Park in Brooklyn to Astoria in Queens, alternatives analyses for which are underway by EDC and DOT. If designed well, this transit investment could be transformative for Red Hook and generate economic development benefits for the surrounding real estate. The costs of streetcar construction per mile are significantly higher than the costs of high-quality bus service, raising questions about the relative mobility value of this proposed plan, but experience in other cities has shown that a permanent transit investment sends signals to real estate developers, bringing economic growth potential to the area. However, the streetcar is not slated to be completed until 2024, assuming these plans move forward and funding can be secured; unlike many capital projects financed through municipal bonds, the BQX financing strategy relies on value capture from the increased real estate property taxes of surrounding developments. Indeed, public funding (and political will for public funding) is increasingly difficult to obtain to cover the total costs for transit investment. Although President Trump has repeatedly touted a major infrastructure investment as a key tenet of his administration, his words have so far been hollow. The Trump Administration’s recent budget blueprint proposed eliminating two of the most critical programs for transportation: the New Starts and Small Starts program (Capital Investment Grants), which matches over $2 billion in local funding for major public transit projects every year, and the popular TIGER program, which funds transportation projects in all 50 states that generate economic benefits and create jobs. Although this budget proposal is only a blueprint and likely will face opposition from Congress, it sends a strong message that the Trump Administration does not value the public investments in transit that are so critical to economically successful cities. As a result of these recent signals, which exacerbate years of federal under-investment in transportation, cities are looking to new and creative ways to both fund public transit and create new mobility options. How can cities connect people to jobs, schools, and retail in a political climate that chooses not to invest in transit projects? Mobility technologies In the relative vacuum of political will to invest in frequent, reliable public transit options, private mobility providers are rushing to meet demand. Some private mobility options are implemented in coordination and partnership with the city government to complement and improve existing public transportation and fill connectivity gaps, while other private sector innovations are introduced independently to capitalize on opportunities left unmet by the public transportation network. Whether the public sector participates and partners, or not, these new technologies have emerged as a stopgap measure for mobility, continuously shaping the way people move through cities. As these technologies become more ubiquitous, they will also shape the design of cities and our approach to mobility. Bike share, microtransit and autonomous vehicles are three private technologies that have and will continue to shape mobility in Red Hook. These innovations stand to be enhanced through public sector participation and supporting investment. Citibike locations in Red Hook, Brooklyn (CitibikeNYC) Bike share Citi Bike, a public-private bike share partnership between Motivate and the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), opened in May 2013 with 6,000 stations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Since 2013, ridership has grown exponentially every year and an influx of new stations have expanded the service area. In August of 2016, Citi Bike added 13 stations in Red Hook, providing an additional mobility option for trips to, from, and within the neighborhood, and a convenient connection to the subway and bus lines. Without public investment Citi Bike operates without direct public funding, though the system operator, Motivate, is contractually held to standards set by the City, providing opportunities to align incentives and goals between the public and private sector. Between August 2016 and December 2016, nearly 13,000 Citi Bike trips originated from the 13 Red Hook stations. These trips are distributed over weekdays and weekends. The top destination of Red Hook-originated weekday and weekend trips is Smith Street and 9th Street, which is adjacent to the Smith and 9th Street subway stop for the F and G lines. Weekday trips to this subway connection are three times higher than the next most frequented stop, Reed Street and Van Brunt Street, which offers a connection to the Ikea Express Ferry. These top weekday destinations in Red Hook demonstrate the usage of Citi Bike for multimodal and “last mile” connections. Weekend trips have a larger distribution of end points than weekday trips, with top destinations including other areas of Red Hook and Brooklyn Bridge Park. Even without direct City funding, Citi Bike ridership will undoubtedly continue to grow and provide a last mile connection to and from Red Hook. However, Citi Bike as an equitable mobility option and economic driver could be enhanced with additional City investment. (Citi Bike) With public investment Today, there are few dedicated bike lanes that connect Red Hook to transit. Although portions of Columbia Street and Clinton Street contain bike lanes, the majority of bicyclists must share lanes with cars in an already transit-constrained area. NACTO (National Association of City Transportation Officials) found that bike ridership increases when cities provide higher-quality facilities and dedicated bike lanes. Access to bike lanes is an issue of equity in transportation: research has shown that people of color are more likely to say that they would ride more if there were protected bike lanes. Additionally, focus groups have found that women are more likely than men to “cite concerns about safety and lack of bike infrastructure as reasons not to use bike share.” Citi Bike’s user data reflect these findings; systemwide, 66% of Citi Bike users between August and December 2016 were men while 22% were women (12% of users did not identify gender). Red Hook ridership reflects a similar picture. In order to encourage biking and bike share among all demographic groups, the City should continue to invest in dedicated bicycle lanes as a way to support safe last-mile connections, as well as an environmental and healthy transit option. (Citi Bike) The City should also partner with community-based organizations to encourage Citi Bike ridership in Red Hook. In the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, a trusted community-based organization (Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation) has championed Citi Bike as a way to improve health and food access. This dedicated community engagement effort has increased Citi Bike membership in the majority-Black neighborhood by 56%, and more than tripled the number of bike share trips taken in the area. A similar community-based engagement effort in Red Hook would help ensure that the neighborhood’s 8,000 NYCHA residents are aware of the available reduced-fee membership and can benefit from Citi Bike as a mobility option. Citibikes in Red Hook, Brooklyn (The Brooklyn Paper) Citi Bike usage, specifically its utility in making multimodal connections, demonstrates its importance and role in Red Hook. Its usage will no doubt grow over time, and could be improved and grown further with public sector investment in dedicated bike lanes that connect to nearby transit connections, and community partnerships for meaningful outreach. However, Citi Bike is not a feasible mode for all people or for all trips, and therefore Citi Bike investment alone is not a perfectly equitable solution to Red Hook’s limited mobility. On-demand microtransit Microtransit platforms such as Bridj and Via allow people to use an app to request on-demand shuttle service, aiming to provide the directness and convenience of a car at a cost that competes with public transit. Users can set the pick-up and drop-off location for shared point-to-point transportation, and the app’s algorithm will nudge users to the nearest corner or mutually-convenient pick-up point to reduce overall delay. Rather than the fixed route of a public bus or subway line, app-enabled microtransit routes update automatically according to demand, providing a more efficient ride. These apps, developed by private companies, can fill gaps in public transit service, providing a direct connection between two points that would require multiple transfers by bus, or shuttling people from their homes to a subway line that is just beyond walking distance. Without public sector involvement Microtransit can improve mobility and support first/last mile connections for those who can afford it if the market drives supply. Private-sector microtransit companies generally do not need public-sector buy-in to operate; Via already operates in New York City, though service is limited to Manhattan south of 125th Street, Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn, and the city’s airports. It is reasonable to expect that Via service will expand to other parts of New York City including Red Hook, without public sector involvement. This and other private microtransit services will improve mobility for those who can afford it, but without government regulation, private sector providers will not be required to meet social equity goals, and these services may undermine city goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled and encourage public transit use. Though private-sector microtransit can fill an important niche where public transit is scarce, infrequent, or unreliable, microtransit platforms also have the potential to cannibalize public transit ridership and erode revenue streams for transit agencies, contributing to a vicious cycle that further degrades transit service and further discourages ridership. Though true microtransit is distinct from app-based taxi service, lessons can be drawn from a recent report about the congestion impacts of app-based ride-hail trips in New York City. The report’s author found that services like Uber and Lyft have added 50,000 vehicles to New York City streets, and in 2016 alone added an additional 600 million miles of driving. Though microtransit has the potential to encourage shared rides, the availability of pooled options such as UberPool, LyftLine, and Via has not dampened the overall effect of an increase in vehicle miles driven. In Red Hook specifically, app-based taxi service like Uber and Lyft, which are already available in the neighborhood, pooled rides (such as UberPool and LyftLine, which are also available) and microtransit, which has not yet reached Red Hook, can fill gaps in existing transit service or provide a convenient alternative for those who can afford it, but a proliferation of these services risks burdening the neighborhood’s streets with additional vehicles, adding to congestion and further slowing down public buses. With public investment and participation Public transit agencies could integrate these technologies into their services. Microtransit could have designated pick-up zones, making it more broadly known and easier to access, and reducing conflicts between shuttles picking up passengers and other traffic. Microtransit costs could be subsidized for those who otherwise cannot afford to ride and who lack access to public bus routes or subway stations, creating economic opportunities through improved access to jobs. Taking it further, the City and the MTA could integrate private-sector innovations into public transit service and develop a pilot or public-private partnership to test microtransit in Red Hook, bringing the benefits of dynamic, on-demand microtransit in line with public sector goals of equity and accessibility. In places ranging from Kansas City to a Minneapolis suburb, transit agencies are experimenting with microtransit, using app services to provide on-demand transit in a branded, comfortable 12-passenger van. These initiatives have had varying levels of success, from over 4,000 rides a month in the Minneapolis suburb to a more limited 100 rides a month in Kansas City, demonstrating the importance of system design and marketing, as well as the importance of aligning incentives between the public sector and the private operator. Autonomous vehicles Today, it seems technologists, urbanists, designers, developers, and policy wonks are only talking about autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the way they will shape the design of our cities. Private companies including Google, Intel, Uber, Audi, Ford, and Tesla are doubling down on developing this technology, with beta testing occurring to-date in California, Arizona, and Pittsburgh. The question for policy makers, urban designers, and developers is no longer if but when for autonomous vehicles. Without public sector involvement Fleets of on-demand AVs may become the preferred mode of transportation for those who can afford them. The growth in ridesharing technology should act as an indicator that people are looking for more convenient mobility options and can adapt quickly to new options. However, like ridesharing, AVs are not a full mobility solution. AVs may decrease the number of cars on the road, but only if they are shared. If instead AVs are for personal ownership, they may in fact increase congestion. For example, an AV may drive someone to their job, then drive on with no passengers to low-cost parking, thereby increasing parking demand and adding to road congestion. AVs in Red Hook may decrease demand for public transit investment but should not be considered a replacement for high-capacity transit. Without equitable access or pricing, and given development proposals along the waterfront in Red Hook, autonomous vehicles may only serve to increase socioeconomic segregation in the community, with those living and working along the waterfront not utilizing public transit or supporting businesses further east. Much like ridesharing, AVs will leave those who cannot afford the technology still in need of public transit solutions. With public sector involvement Shared, autonomous vehicles might act like on-demand micro-transit, supporting last-mile connections for all who need them. Unlike the other private-sector driven mobility options discussed in this essay, AVs will benefit most from regulation as opposed to public capital investment. Public regulation should seek to curb pollutants and traffic congestion associated with cars. Public sector policies can also help to make AVs more equitable, supporting access to AVs for those who otherwise cannot afford them for last mile connections. The City should begin studying its preferred policy options now before the technology comes to market. If regulated properly, shared fleets of autonomous vehicles in Red Hook could create a last-mile connection to nearby subways, decrease personal car ownership, reduce parking demand in the neighborhood, and curb pollutants from cars. What’s next? Private sector investment in mobility technology will continue to move forward with or without public sector participation. The public sector should play an integral role in supporting and regulating these innovations as a way to shape equitable development in Red Hook. Without public sector involvement in transit in Red Hook, those who can afford to pay for private transit options will benefit, making Red Hook a neighborhood that is accessible only for the affluent. Public transit investments and regulations need to be coupled with policies for inclusive and resilient growth in Red Hook so that long-time residents and businesses are not priced out of the community once mobility paves the way for redevelopment and significant residential growth.

Red Hook Link: A Proposal Posted on April 7, 2017 Traditional transit access in Red Hook, Brooklyn is limited. Alternative modes of transportation like ferries, bike and private car-share services, have become critical in how the neighborhood is accessed. Mobility issues that include unpredictability of the local public transit, as well as lack of accessibility and affordability of some of the alternatives, have also exacerbated the current sense of isolation of the neighborhood. On weekends, visitors and local residents take advantage of the free IKEA shuttle to connect from Lower Manhattan to the pier at Van Brunt Street (Eugenia Di Girolamo) Bus service (B61 and B57) is currently the only mass transit options in Red Hook. Local residents often complain about the unreliability of the service Residents and visitors would benefit from seeing all modes of transit on a single platform, and making transit information more accessible is a simple, affordable way to tackle mobility challenges in Red Hook. Enabling a direct linkage between all transportation data pertaining to the neighborhood with a central public database would unlock possibilities for real time sharing of transportation choices on different platforms. The data could be shared through dedicated apps or integrated in existing interfaces, for example as a plug-in on popular apps, like Google Maps or Citymapper, and/or on local public systems, such as LinkNYC or MTA On the Go, and on private services, such as TransitScreen. Current transit options in Red Hook, Brooklyn include buses, private ferry and shuttle services offered by the local IKEA store, and CitiBike bike share stations across the neighborhood. An planned expansion of the East River Ferry will provide additional connections to Lower Manhattan as well as other locations in South Brooklyn (Eugenia Di Girolamo) One potential implementation could be Red Hook Link, a new smart mobility app enabling better display of available transportation options in Red Hook. The Link would consolidate all options on a single platform and supply real-time arrivals as well as alternative, informal modes like on-demand micro-transit, with seemingly instantaneous capability to integrate new forms of transit as they are developed, like shared autonomous vehicles for example. Beyond transit information, Red Hook Link could also provide direct access to information related to affordability of the transportation options it displays with clear directions on how to obtain discounted fares. The app could be developed and managed by the MTA or NYCDOT, in partnership with a local BID or community organization, and funded through federal grants aimed to advance mobility on demand, like the Federal Transit Administration’s MOD Sandbox Program. Red Hook Link could be accessed as a standalone app, as well as a physical interface similar to, or integrated with, LinkNYC. Red Hook Link kiosks could be installed throughout the neighborhood, but also at strategic locations at major points of access into the system. A system like Red Hook Link would enable a new integrated mobility experience, operating as an extension of the existing traditional transit system that could improve the everyday quality of life of the neighborhood’s visitors and, most importantly, its residents and workers. Red Hook Link, a new smart mobility app enabling better display of available transportation options in Red Hook Red Hook Link could be integrated into existing kiosks, like LinkNYC, and installed throughout the neighborhood to offer real time transit information to local users and enhance accessibility to and from Red Hook"

He directed the BIG team in its winning proposal for the Rebuild by Design competition, and now leads urban design of the subsequent East Side and Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency Projects for the City of New York. He has been working with Bjarke Ingels and BIG since the establishment of its New York office in 2010. 												 	 Resiliency And... Posted on April 7, 2017 Four years ago, following the unexpected and destabilizing event that was Hurricane Sandy, our office was asked to participate in a competition called Rebuild by Design – a federal competition initiated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, geared toward finding solutions for building long-term resiliency into our cities and coastlines. As a new challenge for the U.S., we were also asked to define this very term – resiliency – what it means, what it might not mean. Implicitly, there was the notion that this had to do with climate – resiliency as a response to a climate that is changing, a way of strengthening and fortifying ourselves against a specific threat. New York After the Storm (Iwan Baan) On first read, this felt like a new and interesting, yet somehow specialized exercise – a new field of buoyant buildings, absorptive green spaces, and evacuation plans. As a designer coming into this, the task felt perhaps deceptively clear – the image that came to mind was of neatly conceived feats of design that allowed houses to float, or sophisticated gates that might magically transform cities into stationary urban arks. What happened however was quite different. We were thrown into a world of aging, crumbling coastal infrastructure and highways with increasingly questionable utility; of long neglected low-income neighborhoods, and systemic distrust in government to solve local problems; of open spaces sorely lacking proper stewardship, and communities sometimes seeking to keep them that way for fear of gentrification and displacement; of dredge cycles and declining ecologies, and shifting relationships between communities and their historic surrounds. In short, resiliency was almost the last question we came to in trying to work on the problem in an urban context. What has been fascinating is how this one thread of resiliency touches everything in a city. The concept unlocks and is unlocked by discussions about nearly everything that shapes cities – from environment to transportation, housing and open space, governance and economics – and the way in which all these elements are intricately related to one another. Our approach to the problem began with an idea we call “Social Infrastructure.” Like a pro-active version of the Highline, how could we piggyback upgrades to the urban realm, literally, on top of the massive investments required to raise shorelines and build resiliency into the city fabric? As designers this was a powerful possibility. But equally powerful is the way in which this piggybacking has functioned politically – in some of the most difficult environments, the need for resiliency has provided the ability to unlock multiple dimensions of city making – a form of crisis that spurs communities and governments to deal not only with climate risk but to re-think all those aspects of the city that are impacted – and to build unlikely consensus over projects and ideas that might otherwise never come close to being realized. The Big U (Bjarke Ingels Group) Upon reflection, this is of course also completely unsurprising, and would not be the first time that crisis were the source of a city’s transformation and self-reflection in multiple aspects. From the civil unrest that gave way to Haussman’s Paris, to Chicago’s Great Fire of 1871 which produced a rebuilding that generated the world’s first skyscrapers, to the demands of Cold-War defense logistics that helped generate the U.S. interstate highway system, crises have often been the instigators of broad urban change, for good or for bad, and with complex and interlocking effects. Great Chicago Rebuilding (1872) This year, as part of the Forefront Fellowship, we were asked to think about how our work impacts or is impacted by technological advancements – and implicitly, the climate crisis we deal with today begins with the issue of technology. It is the slowly advancing march of industry and the harnessing of fossil fuels, accelerated in the mid-19th century, which is the identified cause of an increasingly warm and polluted planet – and the point at which all registrations of a marked shift in global climate begin. The Lower East Side of Manhattan, the site for what would become the first phase of our efforts on “The Big U”, has in many ways been shaped by the very forces that now challenge it – and provides an interesting look at the way in which thinking about resiliency expands quickly into a broader exercise. Interstate 85 Construction in North Carolina (1958) Beginning as a coastal marshland inhabited by the Lenape Indians, the LES’s early occupation as an agricultural area slowly expanded through shoreline reclamation to accommodate countless piers serving a global maritime trade, adjacent to factories and warehouses supplying these goods, as well as a tenement district housing workers and longshoremen. It is this same industry that helped contribute to worldwide carbon emissions, and the land, built at low elevations, that is now subject to the effects of sea level rise. As maritime trade in Manhattan declined, migrating to ex-urban areas with room for growth and horizontal space for modern containerized shipping, it was supplanted by public housing, which would slowly concentrate poor and minority communities on this low lying land, and a decade later the FDR Drive – which would accommodate vehicular flow of goods and higher-income suburban commuters back into and out of the city on a daily basis. These flows of single-passenger vehicles and high-emissions trucks would cut off access to the waterfront for those still living in the area, while further contributing to global carbon emissions. And it is these same emissions that helped generate the 13.8’ storm surge of Hurricane Sandy, overtopping the roughly 8’ elevation coastal park and neighborhood, and sending the area’s population and poorly maintained public housing stock into a sustained crisis that lasts to this day. Smoke Over New York City, 1936 (Fairchild Aerial Survey) Construction of East River Promenade and Park, 1938 Construction of Riis Houses and FDR Drive Expressway, 1956 The question asked of our team, and that city-builders in New York and elsewhere are now asking themselves, is what we can we do about this? As nature increasingly challenges coastal cities, it is natural systems, in fact, that we need to create to adapt to these effects. But in a city that epitomizes the conflict between different land uses for real estate, how might we actually be able to make room for these expanded forms of resiliency? If technology, in its industrial form, produced the LES’s climate challenges, can it also now provide some ways forward? Flooded and disconnected; East River Park and FDR Drive today (Jeremy Siegel) Technologies such as driverless cars could make huge swathes of roadway surfaces redundant – able to pack more closely together while moving, to seamlessly choreograph intersection crossings without traffic lights, and eliminating the need for parking altogether. Could this avail more space for natural areas that might handle stormwater, moderate temperature swings, and provide open spaces for a growing population? Might automated logistics and smart time-management further free up urban spaces, allowing for deliveries and waste removal to be handled on a 24-hour cycle? This could make available acres of roadways, sidewalks, and public space that today host a competition for space between pedestrians, nature, and overly sized, carbon emitting vehicles that often bring mid-day traffic to a standstill. Coastal highways like the FDR and others still encumber the city’s shorelines, relics of an era in which easy access into and out of cities was privileged over quality of life within cities themselves. As more goods production, waste processing, and living co-mingle with each other in cities, aided by cleaner, more efficient industry, can we win back space for ferry service, bike routes, housing, and other forms of transit and occupation that could further reduce our reliance on carbon? Can more efficient use of our current building stock, enabled by apps such as AirBNB or Google Spaces, reduce the amount of land area occupied by traditional hotels and office buildings, leaving it open for sustainable, non-suburban housing or natural areas? And can local manufacturing, pre-fabrication, and material advances make this re-construction quicker and more feasible? Designing for autonomous vehicles – streets for people and nature first; Google Campus, Mountain View (Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick Studio) Through our and others work on Rebuild by Design, we have been able to inject some of this thinking into the processes of project identification and implementation as New York City plans for the future. Beginning with open space and waterfront access, we will be restoring 2.25 miles of waterfront parks on the East Side, reconnecting them to their communities with new bridges and re-introducing native and salt-tolerant ecological areas, alongside areas for active recreation and sports. Widened and enhanced bike routes will allow New Yorkers to more easily commute along the coast without needing to hail a cab, and expanded ferry service will link these routes to other coastal neighborhoods throughout the city. In Lower Manhattan, constrained for space and encumbered by an aging FDR viaduct, the city has already begun exploring creative ways to think about bundling transportation, open space, and other neighborhood improvements to achieve multiple goals with its resiliency projects. But as with any long-range planning effort, there are challenges in matching future possibilities with the physical and political realities that exist today. While a single, forward-thinking landowner such as Google might be able to take risks and experiment at the scale of a campus, the speed of technological advancement will likely outpace that at which large cities like New York are able to incorporate these into shovel-ready public projects. This makes future flexibility an important consideration in resiliency work, and provides an additional parameter in siting, design, and phasing of improvements – from consideration of future transit, to land use, to logistics and operations, all of which will be shaped by the kinds of technological advancements being discussed today. Multi-Purpose Levee Concept, NYC Special Initiative for Recovery and Resiliency, 2013 Today, East River Park, Delancey Street – East Side Coastal Resiliency Project (Bjarke Ingels Group) The Bridging Berm – East Side Coastal Resiliency Project (Bjarke Ingels Group) Manhattan Greenway – East Side Coastal Resiliency Project (Bjarke Ingels Group) Stuyvesant Cove Park – East Side Coastal Resiliency Project (Bjarke Ingels Group) Stuyvesant Cove Park, Storm – East Side Coastal Resiliency Project (Bjarke Ingels Group) These advances provide seductive possibilities, and many will likely aid in making New York and other coastal cities more able to reduce carbon emissions while adapting to the climate we have created for ourselves in the present. But as with any technology or development that works at scale, these will just as surely have knock-on effects that are difficult to predict – how will communities develop as turnover increases through space sharing? How will local economies react to automation of services and the loss of these jobs? What will increased interaction with machines, rather than people, do to our social fabric? The answers to these questions may be impossible to predict, but this makes it all the more important to take this moment in history to think holistically about our coastal neighborhoods and shorelines, dealing with both climate resiliency and, at the same time, all those aspects of the city that will make them more social, livable, and exciting places to be in the future – while being wary of the same forms of technophoria and myopia that have produced the very challenges we are faced with today.

Posted on April 7, 2017 The concept of resiliency is not limited to the physical environment; it can also be applied to social and economic systems. Maintaining a balance of all three systems is important for communities as they address the five phases of emergency management: prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. 2017 has brought advancements in technology related to transportation infrastructure like automated and electric vehicles, ride-hailing apps, recycled and environmentally friendly construction materials, to name a few. Yet while there have been global advancements in transportation technology, certain neighborhoods within New York City are slower adopt these advancements—even if they are more commonplace in other parts of the City and in other transportation systems around the world. Without being on the cutting edge of technological invention, there are current devices and technologies that exist today can help these communities ‘catch up’, and also positively influence public transportation ridership. The transportation network of the North Shore of Staten Island– currently undergoing an economic, physical and social transformation—presents an opportunity to implement this hypothesis. North Shore, Staten Island’s downtown The North Shore of Staten Island (or Downtown Staten Island as it is affectionately called) is going through a period of major economic investment and neighborhood transformation. Through major private and City investment, the North Shore is seeing the construction of new mixed used buildings (Lighthouse Point), multi-unit residential complexes (URBY Staten Island), retail centers (Empire Outlets) and tourist attractions such as the New York Wheel—an observation wheel that is set to be the world’s largest. The Bay Street Corridor, a vital roadway and commercial corridor within the North Shore, is simultaneously undergoing a neighborhood planning study in an effort to reevaluate land uses, create open space, support economic vitality and construct affordable housing. While phased, this influx of development and neighborhood rezoning will impact all components of the environmental and social infrastructure. Dilapidated pier adjacent to the North Shore right-of-way rail line. The pier was destroyed as a result of Superstorm Sandy (Tiffany-Ann Taylor) Unfortunately Superstorm Sandy left its mark on Staten Island as it left the North Shore with the most damage and life lost within New York City. Battered shorelines and businesses being rebuilt and raised above sea level are reminders that Sandy, or far worse, can happen again. These key lessons have taught New Yorkers that with all of this development happening, now more than ever–social, environmental and economic resiliency are necessary for communities to not only survive but also to grow sustainably. A key part of this sustainability is the efficiency and diversification of the area’s transportation network. Resiliency and Staten Island’s the North Shore’s transportation problem It is no secret that Staten Islanders love their cars, and the North Shore is no different. There are many options within the transportation network on this part of the island as it is home to the Staten Island Railway (SIR), the St. George Ferry Terminal (the major transportation hub for the island and the main connection to Manhattan), 22 bus routes, and bike routes scattered throughout the area. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has also examined public transit alternatives for Staten Island’s North Shore. In 2015, the MTA allocated $5 million to further study the feasibility of Bus Rapid Transit as a result. As new residents and visitors venture to Staten Island to live and patronize new developments, the pressure of new ridership demands will be put on the local transportation network and it must adapt in order to ensure the community’s resilience. Abandoned station platform for the North Shore ROW rail line (Tiffany-Ann Taylor) When conducting a transportation study on Staten Island and interacting with community stakeholders, I learned quickly that it is still a challenge to get North Shore residents and ferry commuters to embrace intra-island public transportation. Combined with a general aversion to increased building heights, population density and diversity in housing stock, North Shore residents are putting themselves in a vulnerable position that perpetuates a lack of affordable housing, increased commercial vacancies and disinvestment in the public transportation network. The existing infrastructure can support increased ridership and current technology can be used to encourage its use. Diversity in transportation options supports equity in transportation accessibility, spurs economic development and allows for easier evacuations prior to an event and facilitates a faster restoration to normalcy afterwards. Using today’s technology to prepare for tomorrow Innovations in technology happen every day. However, the distribution of these new ideas moves much slower. Local governments (county, City, State and otherwise) do not always have the luxury of constantly purchasing new technology even if it increases user experience and system efficiency. However, I will argue, that sometimes already existent technology can be implemented and make a huge impact. During the course of my transportation study, I realized that while encouraging Staten Islanders to rethink their transportation options was a challenging task, current technologies and data exist to help increase awareness and ultimately, the efficiency of the transportation network on the North Shore. The following devices and software were found to be instrumental in bridging the conversation between economic growth and the need for diversity in transportation options, in order to accommodate both new and old visitors and residents: Social media campaigns that promote public transit awareness Create and distribute short web addresses (bit.ly/SINorthShore) to encourage passengers to participate in mobile phone friendly trip generation surveys Real-time passenger information signs were suggested to improve the trip planning experience Transit Signal Priority (hardware that can be installed on traffic signals and transit vehicles to give them priority at intersections) was recommended to improve the travel time of bus passengers Ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft were not included as recommendations in the study but should be considered advancements in transportation technology. These businesses incentivize their carpooling features and are beginning to venture into automated vehicular travel—arguably something to consider as part of environmentally friendlier travel Using real-time passenger information signs as an example, these devices display messages to inform passengers of the next arriving train or bus. During an event, these signs can also be used to broadcast emergency information. Real-time information signage for Select Bus Service in New York City (AM New York) Climate Change, future federal policy and funding The effects of climate change mean that New York City will continue to see an increase in both frequency and severity of natural weather events. With the understanding that that the City is also an unfortunate target for manmade attacks, it becomes abundantly clear that we must be proactive and prepare for the worst. In order for Staten Islanders, and the rest of the City, to be prepared we need to make sure that our infrastructures (social, environmental and physical) are healthy, sustainable and resilient. A diverse and redundant transportation network is a critical component to being prepared. We are currently in the first year of a new federal administration and what will undoubtedly be the beginning of more conservative governing, policy creation and spending. At the time this piece was written, a draft of the Country’s new federal budget was been released but not yet adopted. Therefore it is unclear what programs that encourage technological innovation, support capital investments in physical infrastructure or protect our environment will be affected by budget cuts. So we may have to start thinking critically about how we can use what we already have to help us prepare for new challenges tomorrow."

Posted on April 7, 2017 A walk through Sunset Park will lead you across vestiges of old New York. Still a working industrial port and manufacturing hub, the neighborhood hearkens back to the days when New York City’s might was intertwined with the success of its shipping industry. A walk to the waterfront from the subway winds through busy commercial corridors, neat row houses, busy bus stops, and the remnants of old trolley tracks that once wound through the neighborhood, containers and cranes ever-present in the background. A home to immigrant workers, the neighborhood has shifted from Norwegian to Italian to the present day Mexican and Chinese communities that call it home. However, as the rest of New York City changes, time is catching up with Sunset Park. New developments such as Industry City, Liberty View Industrial Plaza, the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, Bush Terminal, the Whale Building, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal are rapidly changing the neighborhood landscape. The Brooklyn Nets own practice space in the area and West Elm and Design Within Reach each have showrooms nestled between blighted warehouses. Sunset Park certainly isn’t an anomaly. Immigrant and working class neighborhoods across New York City are bracing themselves for speculation and gentrification. However, the neighborhood Park has received something other communities haven’t: the attention of the City. The New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC), the Department of City Planning, and the de Blasio administration have set their sights on Sunset Park as New York’s next “innovation hub”, based largely on the success of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In a breakfast with Crain’s Business in 2016, Maria Torres Springer, the president of EDC at the time, made a promise that her agency would transform Sunset Park into a “vibrant community,” in large part by connecting the neighborhood to the city’s burgeoning tech sector. The EDC spearheaded Brooklyn Queens Connector (BQX) trolley, one of Mayor Bill DeBlasio’s most ambitious projects, promises to provide links between Astoria, Long Island City, Williamsburg, Downtown Brooklyn, and Sunset Park- and a more interconnected New York City tech sector. New York’s tech ecosystem New York City’s tech industry has taken off in the past few years as a result of a shift from the traditional Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) sector approach that has been a cornerstone of the city’s economy. In an effort to expand the tax base, the City has looked to tech as an engine of economic growth. According to an EDC official, the City has not considered a neighborhood or place based approach to tech, but rather has focused on creating a “tech ecosystem.” The BQX plays a crucial role in developing such an ecosystem by connecting neighborhoods with blossoming tech economies. Downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City, Williamsburg, and Astoria, have all seen a rise in startups and tech investment. In a nod to North Carolina’s research triangle, Downtown Brooklyn, DUMBO, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard are newly designated as the Brooklyn Tech Triangle. Williamsburg, with its booming office market, is home to an increasing number of startups and light manufacturing firms. City officials hope that Sunset Park’s industrial past will evolve into manufacturing that supports 3-D printing and biotech research. Rendering of the Brooklyn Queens Connector (Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector) EDC has expressed hope that investment in the tech sector will both expand the tax base and simultaneously create new job growth in underserved neighborhoods, spurred by the connection provided by the BQX. The trolley line has approximately 30 stops along its route, each spaced about half a mile from each other, many within the City’s new tech hubs. EDC projects that the BQX will create $25 billion in economic impact and 28,000 temporary jobs over the course of thirty years and that it will increase access to jobs for a “workforce equipped with the skills needed to participate in the 21st century economy.” Tech: Who is it good for? However, the question that community groups, policy advocates, and administration insiders alike are asking is: new jobs for whom? Though the BQX has received support from some local community organizations, called the Friends of the BQX, and some New York City Housing Authority residents, many Sunset Park residents along the BQX route worry that the trolley will increase speculation in an already high pressure real estate market, with little return to the community. As of 2014, New York City’s tech sector was 70% White. Asians comprised 17% of the sector, while Blacks and Latinos represented only 17% and 11% respectively. Conversely, 80% of Sunset Park’s residents are nonwhite. 40% of residents are Latino while 30% are Asian. Though the average annual income of tech workers in New York City is $107,661, wages vary by race and subsector, with people of color earning substantially less than their white counterparts. Advocates worry that not only will new tech jobs be inaccessible to current residents, but once they are, that they will be the lowest paid jobs available. However, others find hope in the possibility for economic advancement through tech jobs. Christine Curella of the Mayor’s Office of Workforce Development stated that through job training, residents would be prepared not for a single opportunity, but a multitude of 21st century opportunities. Rising property taxes, rising displacement? Residents and advocates alike are wary that current residents will pay for the construction of the BQX and will not be able to remain in the neighborhood long enough to benefit from its purported value- whether through access to transit or to jobs. Ryan Chavez of local community group UPROSE states that though tax increment financing can be useful in certain scenarios, the model is detrimental to Sunset Park’s neighborhood economy. “When we are talking about running transit based on this mechanism through heavy industrial zones that depend on low property values to survive, the two cannot be reconciled. Industrial retention is a core concern locally and imperative to serving the economic needs of our community.” The biggest issue, however, remains the inflation of property values. Chavez continues, “Moreover, inflating property values throughout a working-class community like Sunset Park, which is already facing dramatic displacement pressures, demonstrates a callous disregard for vulnerable residents and small businesses.” (US Census Bureau, 2014: Quarterly Workforce Indicators Data) Estimated to cost $2.5 billion, the BQX is designed to be “self-financed”. A departure from traditional municipal bonds, the BQX financing depends on rising property taxes. Increase in property taxes as a result of a rise in property value along the streetcar routes will be captured to pay for the cost of the project. The BQX’s success is dependent on the creation and preservation of new, high cost real estate. This exacerbates community concern that the creation of BQX will not be of use to current residents. In a community where a quarter of residents are homeowners, a steep rise in property taxes can be untenable and ultimately lead to displacement. While the full borough of Brooklyn has seen skyrocketing property values, speculation in Sunset Park has been slower- until the past few years. Between 2002 and 2014, median home values rose by 31%, from $250,000 to $800,000 and median monthly rent rose from $750 to $1,255 in the same time period. And the neighborhood’s demographics have slowly changed as well. In a neighborhood with limited rent regulated housing stock and 60% of residents already rent burdened, the prospect of an influx of luxury condominiums and increased housing costs is disconcerting. According to the Furman Center, average median income rose 4.7% between 2010 and 2014; however, the poverty rate also rose risen slightly, with 32% of the population living in poverty. Residents and advocates alike are wary that current residents will pay for the construction of the BQX and will not be able to remain in the neighborhood long enough to benefit from its purported value- whether through access to transit or to jobs. BQX and business Residents aren’t the only ones concerned about the BQX route. Industrial and manufacturing businesses, which employ 12% of Sunset Park residents worry about tech-focused light manufacturing displacing traditional manufacturing. Changing land use, shifting commercial corridors and streetscapes, and an increase in price per square foot of already expensive M-zone land is a cause for concern for many industrial businesses who already struggle to pay operating costs. And, in a rapidly shifting sector where work happens less on the factory floor, and more on a computer in an office building, advocates of traditional industrial and manufacturing jobs worry about the change from M-zoned land to include office space, creating more competition for already scarce land. Some transit officials are also skeptical of the utility of the streetcar in a neighborhood like Sunset Park, especially during the construction phase which is anticipated to inhibit trucking and transport- vital components of the manufacturing adjacent industries. A New York City Department of Transportation official who asked to remain anonymous stated: “This is a real estate tool. There is no real transportation value to it. I don’t see how manufacturing businesses will benefit from this project.” (Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development) Industrial and manufacturing businesses are also concerned about the displacement of their employees. As the largest walk-to-work community in the country, Sunset Park’s economy is dependent on its residents. Andrea Devening of Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation (SBDIC), an industrial business service provider, noted that displacement of residents is an ongoing concern, as is matching businesses with workers with the skill set and experience needed for industrial jobs. SBIDC works with the City’s Workforce1 Career Centers to connect residents with manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have traditionally provided avenues for economic opportunity for those with limited access to educational advancement, particularly newly arrived immigrants and communities of color. The industrial and manufacturing sector pays double the average wages of a sector with comparable educational requirements, such as retail. However, the number of available manufacturing jobs is limited, and the changing face of the manufacturing sector has shifted the sector toward more high skilled jobs. Businesses and community members worry that the impact of the BQX and a focus on tech will indeed create employment opportunity- but opportunity that is unattainable to current residents and displaces existing manufacturing jobs. Creating equitable transit In order for the BQX to be successful, it must take particular neighborhood needs into account. Sunset Park’s needs are very different from those of DUMBO. And, in order for the City’s vision for an equitable economy fueled by the tech sector to be possible, significant resources must be invested not only into the neighborhood’s physical landscape, but also its people. A tech ecosystem will do little to benefit current Sunset Park residents if they can no longer live or work in their neighborhood. Significant funding for job training, placement, and workforce development is crucial to ensuring that the BQX doesn’t live up to its sobriquet as “the Gentrification Express.” Nolan Levenson ▷ The New Manufacturing Sector: Made for All New Yorkers? Posted on April 7, 2017 Industrial job creation and retention has become a focal point in public policy both locally and nationally. The manufacturing sector has provided steady, well-paying opportunities and a clear path for socioeconomic mobility for over a century in the United States. However, as our society modernizes and continues to embrace globalization and technological development, traditional manufacturing jobs are decreasing. Nowhere is this trend more apparent than in New York City, where there is intense competition for physical space to develop industry, commerce, and housing. The boom in land values has driven a surge in luxury housing and commercial development with disparate impacts on residents and employees. In order to promote equitable development, the City must harness its toolbox to capitalize on growth in the technology and advanced manufacturing sectors to provide quality manufacturing jobs to a wide array of New Yorkers. In recent years, housing and commercial development has been encouraged through zoning. Under Mayor Bloomberg, the Department of City Planning rezoned a number of industrial areas that became real estate hot spots, such as the Williamsburg waterfront. Between 2002 and 2007, the Department of City Planning rezoned close to 1,800 acres of manufacturing-zoned land—approximately 15% of the entire citywide stock (1). In addition, the existing zoning code does not protect manufacturing uses even in industrial areas. Only 3.5% of the city’s total lot area is used for job-intensive manufacturing despite the fact that manufacturing zones account for 14.1% of the city’s total lot area (2). Non-industrial uses are still permitted in manufacturing zones, driving up the value of land for more lucrative uses such as hotels, storage, and night clubs (3). Figure 1 shows the types of uses permitted in these zones. 92% of the Sunset Park waterfront lot area is zoned for manufacturing. Sunset Park, Brooklyn is at the forefront of this pressure on manufacturing land. Its waterfront is one of the few remaining manufacturing areas in New York City, abutted by a primarily minority-majority neighborhood with large immigrant populations that is rapidly gentrifying. 47% of the population is foreign born, and 72% of the population is Hispanic or Asian (4). Increasing rents and development pressure is putting a significant burden on the neighborhood’s population. In addition, unlike many other neighborhoods, Sunset Park residents rely heavily on job opportunities within their community. 20% of residents walk to work, including the waterfront area that has numerous industrial jobs (5). The Sunset Park waterfront is part the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Business Zone (IBZ), which was created to protect and promote industrial growth. Despite the IBZ designation, industrial jobs have declined over time on the Sunset Park waterfront (defined as the waterfront area bound by the Gowanus Canal, Gowanus Expressway, and Belt Parkway). In 2002, there were 8,452 jobs in industrial sectors (manufacturing, wholesale trade, and transportation and warehousing) representing 36.5% of all jobs in the area. In 2014 there were only 6,771 (representing 30.1% of all jobs in the area), a decrease of 19.9% compared to a 5% total job loss in the area between 2002 and 2014 (6). Existing zoning does not prevent developers from creating non-industrial uses in Sunset Park. According to PLUTO data, 92.4% of the lot area is zoned for manufacturing, however 80% of the existing land is used for Industrial, Manufacturing, Transportation, and Utility uses, highlighting the flaws in the zoning code. Of the manufacturing zoned land, 12% of the lot area has an M1 zoning designation, which as previously noted allows for the widest array of uses that drive up land values, making industrial uses financially untenable. This puts industrial development and jobs at risk. 2 Av & 41 St: A typical block in Sunset Park, Brooklyn (Nolan Levenson) While there has been overall job loss on the Sunset Park waterfront, numerous industries have seen increases in recent years. Between 2005 and 2014, commercial uses in the Southwest Brooklyn IBZ more than doubled with an increase of over 2.3 million square feet, an increase of 155% (7). These numbers are indicative of the new wave of non-industrial development that has surged both in Sunset Park and citywide, in particular the significant increase in retail and the tech-related sectors of “Information” and “Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.” (see Figure 4). Some critical questions should be asked about who benefits from this growth and at what cost to others. Is this economic development equitable, particularly for longtime residents of New York City and specifically Sunset Park? Many Sunset Park residents, 29% of which live below the poverty line are effectively excluded from both the consumer and economic development benefits of this growth (8). One of the most successful new employers in the area has been Industry City, which is a thriving commercial area focused on the technology, advanced manufacturing, and luxury commercial sectors. Its featured tenants include Design Within Reach, the Brooklyn Nets, Bauble Bar, and West Elm. A recent New York Times article featured the Extraction Lab, where the manufacturer of a high-end coffee machine called “Steampunk” charges up to $14.75 for a cup of coffee (9, 10). These new businesses are generally looking for college-educated and highly skilled labor—a trend seen around the country (11). In Sunset Park, however, 42% of residents have not completed high school and only 29% have graduated college, making it very difficult to obtain quality jobs in Industry City (12). 1st Avenue- Sunset Park (Nolan Levenson) Many local stakeholders fear that the new wave growth will exacerbate gentrification in Sunset Park. As industrial jobs are replaced by opportunities in tech-oriented, advanced manufacturing, and retail sectors, the amount of quality, well-paying opportunities for low skill minority workers decreases. On average, in Brooklyn and Queens, industrial jobs pay an average of $50,934, about twice the average salary of $25,416 in the retail, hotel, and restaurant sectors (13). In addition, over 80% of industrial workers are from populations of color (14).” This change in opportunities directly impacts many residents of Sunset Park, of which 55% are already rent burdened (15). A number of organizations are working to mitigate some of these issues by preserving manufacturing jobs in Sunset Park, including the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation (SBIDC), which promotes economic development by serving small businesses and residents. SBIDC’s services include workforce development, where they work with local businesses to understand their operations and training needs. Through this program, typically 100 job-seekers are placed each year into quality manufacturing and transportation jobs. In April 2016, through grant funding from the City, they expanded to operate the Brooklyn Workforce 1 Industrial and Transportation Career Center located in the Brooklyn Army Terminal (BAT). They now can serve 250 job seekers annually. Industry City has also launched a program to provide training and education for local residents called the Innovation Lab. The program is relatively new, however, and the impact has yet to be seen (16). The City must have a major role in ensuring that the new tech-oriented and advanced manufacturing development in Sunset Park is equitable. The City is the primary landowner on the Sunset Park waterfront (47.2% according to PLUTO data), including the 97-acre BAT, which gives the City’s Economic Development Corporation broad control of the kinds of development that will occur in Sunset Park. Recently, Mayor de Blasio announced a $136 million investment in Bush Terminal to create the “Made in New York Campus” designed to help “synergize creative manufacturing uses.” The campus will primarily house space for garment manufacturing and film and media production (17). However, if there is truly a commitment to industrial development and jobs, the City must work to change zoning regulations in Sunset Park to ensure that manufacturing uses are central in development. It should learn from previous experiences in waterfront manufacturing areas such as Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where lax manufacturing zoning has encouraged a spur in hotel, retail, residential, and office development. Non-industrial uses such as hotels and storage should require special permits rather than allowing these uses as-of-right. In conjunction with existing workforce development programs, the City should leverage its powerful position to incentivize industry that provides a wide array of employment and training opportunities. It must require that manufacturing uses can thrive in Sunset Park and throughout the city. References 1,2.

Posted on April 7, 2017 Since at least the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the Trump election in the US, it has become clear that the increasing economic and social inequality experienced in these countries also has political consequences. If we want to save the state of our democracies, we need to find ways of stabilizing our economies and provide everyone with a decent economic basis for living. Technology is often seen as a solution to the economic and social issues of today. The tech sector has added 45,000 jobs between 2003 and 2013 in New York City alone and is celebrated for the potential to provide new middle income jobs (HR&A, n.d.). It has however also created the displacement of jobs. Machines, or the automation of production processes, have replaced over 80% of jobs in manufacturing across the U.S. (Hicks and Devaraj, 2015). While some economists (Lewis, 2016) argue that technological advancements always shifted jobs to other, more work-intensive jobs, other economists (Armellini and Pike, 2017) warn that the development of robotics and artificial intelligence might lead to the displacement (without replacement) of millions of jobs. Thus, a question that we need to ask is, will technology enable equitable economic development or endanger the social and economic paradigm of our society? In this essay, I look at how technology changed the social and economic fabric of a New York neighborhood, Sunset Park, and argue that for technology to enable an equitable economic and social outcome for all, we need to fundamentally rethink how we recuperate the collective production of wealth as a society. The universal basic income is one way we can start to think about achieving this goal. Are cities the place to test these policies first? Technology and job creation Questions around how many jobs and which ones will be replaced by technological advancement in robotics and artificial intelligence has become a major focus for research. A report by McKinsey analyzes work activities by their potential for automation and shows that “currently demonstrated technologies could automate 45 percent of the activities people are paid to perform.” For work activities in predictable physical environments, such as activities in manufacturing, food service and accommodation, and retailing, this number is even higher at 78% (Chui et al., 2016). Least susceptible to automation, at least with currently available technologies, are activities like managing others, applying expertise, and stakeholder interactions – all mostly high-skilled activities. With advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, more activities will be replaceable by robots. Well-known examples include the redundancy of taxi drivers in an era of autonomous vehicles or the replacement of translators by computers. While technology and automation will make the economy as such richer, it will reinforce the economic and social inequalities we already see today. Technological advancement however also led to new job creation. The technology sector, defined here as companies that manufacture hardware, develop software, and provide services related to information technology has created thousands of jobs that were non-existent even just a decade ago. Moreover, technology has enabled new forms of advanced manufacturing. There is an increase in companies making specialty products using new technologies such as 3D printing. These companies cater to a consumer base that is willing to pay premium prices for custom made artisanal products. The Center for an Urban Future states in a recent report that New York City’s manufacturing sector has grown by 3,900 jobs in the last five years (Center for an Urban Future, 2016). Technology has also increased spending power – at least among some of us. As technology substitutes labor, consumer prices decrease. As a consequence, people have more expendable income, boosting leisure spending at salons, coffee shops, or cosmetic surgery (Deloitte, 2015). Number of business establishments across all sectors in Sunset Park (zip codes 11220 and 11232) Source: U.S. Census Bureau Researchers do not agree on the question if jobs are created or lost. However, they generally agree that automation replaces or decreases the wages of low-skilled labor and creates new jobs for high skilled labor, widening the income gap further (see, for example, Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2016). In this scheme, as unemployment drives down wages, labor becomes more competitive again compared to the capital costs for introducing robots. What does this mean for an urban neighborhood whose employment basis was traditionally in manufacturing? Sunset Park’s economy: From manufacturing to retail Sunset Park in Brooklyn began to grow at the end of the 19th century when New York’s harbor became increasingly important for the import and export of goods. The industrial waterfront was dominated by the Industry City built in the 1890s as an intermodal shipping, warehousing, and manufacturing site and the Brooklyn Army Terminal built in 1919 as a warehousing and shipping terminal (and the largest military supply base during World War II). The construction of the elevated Gowanus Parkway and white flight contributed to a population decline in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the neighborhood was growing once again with new immigrants populating the area. It continues to grow today, not only in population, but also in employment. The graph below show the growth of business establishments as well as jobs (except for the post financial crisis dip) over the past fifteen years. How equitable is this growth for residents of Sunset Park? Does technology play a major role? Number of paid employees across all sectors in Sunset Park (zip codes 11220 and 11232) Source: U.S. Census Bureau Looking at those sectors that are most directly affected by technological advancement, we see that the number of manufacturing businesses (see Figure 3) declined while the number of business establishments in other sectors increased, most drastically in the retail and wholesale sectors. Employment data (see Figure 4) provides a similar picture. The number of paid employees in manufacturing has significantly decreased over the past 15 years whereas employment in almost every other sector has grown. Looking at the type of establishments in the manufacturing sector back in 1998, the sector was dominated by food and apparel establishments. Interestingly, this has not significantly changed. There seems to be a lot more diversity in the manufacturing sector, but food and apparel still constitute the majority of manufacturing businesses in Sunset Park. The retail and accommodation and food services sectors have seen significant growth in the number of establishments, but not as much in employment growth. This could be an indication that while new businesses open, there are less jobs needed due to automation, confirming the argument that automation with currently established technologies is most able to replace manufacturing, retail, and accommodation and food services jobs. At the same time, the health care and social assistance sector has seen significant growth, in both the number of established businesses as well as paid employees. Number of Sunset Park business establishments according to sector. Source: U.S. Census Bureau. Note: The U.S. Census Bureau’s NAIC codes do not include a specific tech sector, but have technology-based jobs in all sectors. Nevertheless, it was regarded sufficiently illustrative to use these aggregate sectors. Industrial Business Zone: Saving manufacturing The New York City government is committed to preserving manufacturing in Sunset Park. The neighborhood is in the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Business Zone (IBZ), is one of sixteen IBZs created by the New York City Economic Development Corporation to “foster industrial sector growth by creating real estate certainty” (NYCEDC, n.d.), meaning that these areas will not be rezoned for other uses and are supported by tax credits. However, the IBZ designation is already under much pressure as there is a rezoning plan for the Industry City area that would allow for integration of retail and two hotels. In addition to the IBZ designation, the City has made significant investments in Sunset Park, ranging from rail upgrades and open space improvements to capital improvements on city-owned industrial assets such as the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Industry City as well as the Brooklyn Army Terminal are celebrated as new hubs for (advanced) manufacturing. In order to provide jobs to the community (and potentially those who lost their traditional manufacturing jobs), both have educational and training programs. The Innovation Lab at Industry City offers training such as computer classes and is adamant about filling its job with local residents (Interview with SBIDC). The Workforce1 Industrial and Transportation Career (ITC) Center at the Brooklyn Army Terminal offers “candidate and recruitment services responsive to the needs of local residents, including career planning, job search, training and employment support” (NYC Office of the Mayor, 2016). Number of paid employees in Sunset Park according to sectors Source: U.S. Census BureauNote: The U.S. Census Bureau does not publish employment data for zip codes, the above numbers are thus an estimate based on the number of businesses for each employment range. These initiatives certainly have a positive effect on the local economy. As the data however shows, these jobs have – at least so far – not been able to replace the number of jobs lost in the traditional manufacturing sector and with increasing automation, it is unclear if those lost jobs will ever be replaced. This raises the question if we need to find other ways of supporting those who will lose their jobs due to automation and will not have the capabilities to be re-trained for the types of jobs required in an era of automation. Rethinking our economic and social policy: A radical suggestion Today’s economic development policies include lower real estate rents or tax credits to private enterprises in order to lure businesses to priority neighborhoods. This approach helps to revitalize neighborhoods and even provide new jobs. These policies however often have uneven outcomes: While some firms and individuals profit, others do not and – in some cases – even suffer higher costs due to gentrification. With automation and the consequential loss of jobs, the inequality of wealth will likely be even more pronounced. It might therefore be time to rethink our economic and social policies and shift from a system where the collective production of wealth is privately appropriated towards a system where the collective production of wealth is also collectively appropriated as a dividend that goes to each individual (Varoufakis, 2016). Several communities across the world are starting to experiment with a universal basic income where every citizen receives an income to live on. This would not only reduce the stigma to those becoming unemployed due to automation, but would also stabilize aggregate demand for our economy. Sunset Park, a neighborhood that is seen as being at the forefront of the technological changes in manufacturing might also be a good testbed for new social and economic policies such as the basic income.

72,City Government for the New Urban World,https://urbandesignforum.org/city-government-for-the-new-urban-world/,"April 17, 2013","Editor’s Note: The Forum for Urban Design is embarking on a campaign to collect ideas for compelling projects, plans, and policies to better New York City under the next mayor’s tenure. To tie in with this theme, the Urban Design Review will be featuring lessons from pioneering global cities. ‘City Government for the New Urban World’is the second entry in this series. The 21st century city stands poised to play a critical role as a great problem solver and generator of prosperity. We are discovering that only dense cities can reduce our heavy environmental footprint and address the devastating progress of climate change. We are figuring out how to get more out of less, drawing on their inherent capacity to solve multiple problems laterally, not one at a time. And we are embracing Jane Jacobs’ profound insight that cities are not mechanical constructs, but ‘organized complexity’ better understood by analogy with the science of living organisms. But here’s the rub: while this new way of seeing the city is widely shared, we often find that we have inherited systems on auto-pilot that were designed to produce a very different kind of urban world. Municipal governments are siloed provinces of ‘functional’ specialists who too often pay little heed to the way their work affects the quality of the whole. Planners deal with land use, transportation engineers with moving vehicles, designers with buildings and landscapes, municipal engineers with the arrangement of services and so on. This specialization occurred primarily in the two generations following World War II. By the time the dust settled, we had profoundly reshaped most of the urban environment in North America and many other parts of the world in pursuit of a fragmented, often sprawling, auto-dependent model of zoned homogeneity and functional efficiency. Even though our thinking has changed radically, the ‘siloed’ departmental structure set up to deal with specific problems in isolation too often remains intact. It is challenging to do innovative city building projects by feeding them into the old bureaucratic stovepipes. Working through these structures can be like using a hammer to turn a screw. Once we accept cities as dynamic, constantly evolving organisms, it is clear that we need a more supple modus operandi, harnessing our new understanding and using digital age interactive tools. It is a little like getting from classical scores to the improvisational qualities of jazz. It will require a “cognitive leap” from the ways things are currently done, a “disruptive technique” which leads to new ways of solving problems and organizing systems. None of our basic urban challenges exist in isolation. The city needs to be thought of three dimensionally, not just as policies and programs, but as physical places with anticipatory modelling and testing of outcomes. It is critical not to circumscribe problems and opportunities too narrowly–in many cases the meaningful unit of consideration is much larger than the ‘project area’ or even its immediate context. We need to look at the surrounding square miles to truly get all the issues on the table and see the tentacles that extend well outside the boundaries. Underlying social relationships, environmental considerations, economic forces, natural systems, infrastructure and transportation all have their own larger scale logics and do not often fit neatly into planning districts or municipal boundaries. Cross-sector collaboration is essential as we re-invent our economic base, retool our infrastructure, expand our cultural sector, and plan for an aging population. We cannot deal with transit, traffic, cyclists, pedestrians and the economic vitality of our retail streets in isolation. To be effective in city building we have to get the focus back on the real issues and harness the full power of city design as strategic problem solving in the broadest terms. This means not only using the full capabilities of the design professions but also linking the physical and operational decisions to the economic, environmental and social dimensions of change. This shift has been occurring in pockets through an intensive empirical process of trial and error that leads from one city to another. We are gradually moving away from compartmentalizing inside and outside municipal government. Instead, we are blending public and private initiatives, working across disciplinary lines and engaging civil society in new ways. Different kinds of knowledge and new skill sets are added to the creative process, including the contributions of designers, planners, engineers, economists and market specialists; environmental scientists, community service providers; civic leaders; artists and arts organizations among others. In order to fuse all this expertise, it is necessary to create an actual ‘place of convergence’ in City Hall where insights can be pooled and a technique for visualizing overlapping initiatives ‘on the same page’ can be created. Building on my informal experiences with such a model in Toronto, we set up a ‘Design Center’ when I worked with the City of St. Paul. With its own director and a small staff, the design center had a core membership of individuals who worked within City Hall as “city designers” in various capacities, plus a larger ancillary group of staff from the county and other agencies. As we hoped, it has provided a forum where design and city-building issues are discussed by city planners and architects in Planning and Economic Development, landscape architects in the Parks Department, Building Department officials, and transportation and civil engineers in Public Works. When we kick the tires, pitch new ideas and react to one another, we expand the collective “brain” of the team and, in a sense, simulate the complexity of real-world conditions. The expanded team works together from start to finish – like building the entire car together rather than the fragmentation of the assembly line. Often we discovered that the “solution” in one area actually resides in another. Most recently I have been working with the City of Edmonton, Alberta on two assignments: one to do with the creation of a ‘Connectivity Framework’ to track and frame the evolution of this rapidly growing city, and the other to examine how staff from different disciplines can more effectively integrate their work. At this stage in Edmonton’s evolution, things are moving much too fast for the old paradigm to cope effectively. The use of the ‘Framework’ will be a ‘leap’ to get Edmonton from a “good city to a great city.” I have been working with city staff to create a dynamic two and three-dimensional tool that provides an overview of all of downtown plans in time and space. This digital framework depicts the downtown both as it is and how it is evolving, adding even an historical dimension. At once we can examine how historic forces like the river and the removal of rail yards as well as new interventions can be harnessed to help shape the mono-functional CBD into a mixed and vibrant lived-in downtown. This tool shows catalytic projects underway and displays the achievement of the city’s transformational goals in an engaging way. The Framework will get all layers ‘on the same page,’ much like a Google Map with a zoom feature with the ability to delve down into individual project areas in more detail. It can harness the city’s GIS capabilities to see how the downtown is evolving as a dynamic set of relationships and possibilities, many of which are mutually reinforcing one another including land uses, modal shift, changing demographics and economic metrics. Edmonton may be breaking new ground with this interactive tool. However, to be truly successful, the Edmonton Connectivity Framework must be more than a onetime effort–it must become a living instrument. Aspects of this kind of capability may exist elsewhere but not in this comprehensive form. The combination of increased appreciation for how cities actually work plus the explosion of new technological advances make this is an ideal time to make the shift toward innovative new ways of city building. The possibilities are limitless. Mid-size cities with motivated leadership may in fact blaze the trail for cities around the world. Projects like the Edmonton Framework initiative and the St. Paul Design Center are worth replicating in larger cities with more sophisticated bureaucracies. Only then can we switch off the auto-pilot. Ken Greenberg is an architect, urban designer, author, and Principal of Greenberg Consultants.

73,Urbane Renewal: The Recent Evolution of Los Angeles,https://urbandesignforum.org/urbane-renewal-the-recent-evolution-of-los-angeles/,"February 8, 2013","Editor’s Note: The Forum for Urban Design is embarking on a campaign to collect ideas for compelling projects, plans, and policies to better New York City under the next mayor’s tenure. To tie in with this theme, the Urban Design Review will be featuring lessons from pioneering global cities. To start things off, William H. Fain, Jr. has written about Los Angeles’s transition from car-centric sprawl to pioneering urban laboratory in Urbane Renewal. Los Angeles has new lessons to offer urban living today. And despite its sprawling and suburban reputation, its brand of urbanism may be influencing cities around the world as much as its older, Eastern US counterparts. Founded in 1781 as a tiny pueblo of 48 souls, the city’s first generation of significant urban growth occurred in the late 1800’s through the early 1900s as small towns emerged in the region centered around a booming LA downtown. Early development was modest compared to Eastern, well-established cities of the time, but the surrounding small towns and downtown were connected by an 1,100 mile streetcar system—much in the manner of Boston, with its “streetcar suburbs”. This first generation of development established an urban footprint for the region, structured with a public transit system and street grid, which provide the building blocks for the redevelopment and densification occurring today. Boosterism began in the 1890s, beckoning easterners to head west to the healthy, sunny southland. This first generation city extended well into the 1920s coinciding with the formation of major industries in oil production, movies, finance and aeronautics. The city’s expansion was catalyzed by many new educational institutions, including UCLA, Occidental, the Claremont colleges and Caltech. LA is second in the world only to New York City in number of institutions of higher education, which bodes well for its future, competing in the world arena of information and knowledge. Opening day of the Pacific Electric Line at the Long Beach Pier, ca. 1900-1902 Digitally reproduced by the USC Digital Library; From the California Historical Society Collection at the University of Southern California The late 50s and early 60s was a robust time of regional transformation. Southern California epitomized an informal lifestyle and a spatial freedom unparalleled in New York and the East Coast. LA was a perfect setting for the automobile boom following WWII. Wide open spaces between the small towns and the downtown filled in with tract housing for vets home from the Pacific campaign. The car and the single-family home with backyard, pool, and barbecue prevailed. Artists were also seduced by the open urban landscape and informal lifestyle. At a UCLA presentation in 2000, David Hockney recalled the freedom he felt “returning to Los Angeles from London, arriving at my hillside residence and setting out at sunset in a convertible, driving along Mulholland Drive toward Malibu.” The automobile was viewed as an extension of one’s living space and personal freedom. In the 60s and subsequently, developments like Century City were laid out around automobile access and parking dimensions. Developments like Irvine looked vastly different from the super grid areas of the region established earlier. Older places in the region like downtown Los Angeles were characterized as outmoded, congested, and consequently abandoned for these new car-oriented environments. Old Pacific Electric cars are piled up like toys at junkyard on Terminal Island, awaiting dismantling to become scrap metal.Originally published on March 19, 1956 in the Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles Times photographic archive, UCLA Library) When the freeway system took hold in the 60s, it truly redefined the region. Calvin Hamilton, the Los Angeles planning director, introduced the “Centers Concept” in the 60s, which acknowledged the polycentric nature of the area. Los Angeles became one of the first metropolises developed around this new pattern. Others have modeled their growth after LA–especially urban regions with high car dependency, like Houston and Phoenix. LA has also seduced the world with its informal life style and its attitude of integrating work and leisure. Although LA typifies what has happened and what might happen in many other US cities, one thing is certain: LA is building a new form. Los Angeles transformations continue, both planned and unplanned. Our tastes and preferences are becoming more urban: even the culture of the car is being challenged. In 2008, Angelenos passed a sales tax to build new transit lines; we seemed to understand—finally—that we need an alternative to the car. Some undoubtedly supported the measure in the hope that transit use by others would free up the roads. And while opponents narrowly defeated the extension this year, a new culture around public transit is emerging. Little by little, the city is beginning to recognize that older residential, commercial, and industrial neighborhoods are assets for resettlement, and–recalling the old Red Car system–require a vastly improved transit system that is more efficient, faster, and with greater capacity. Already, HOV lanes are being expanded; one stretch of the 110 is now also a toll lane, with more slated to follow, including several miles of Interstate 10 east of downtown. Along with transit, attitudes about density are changing, too. Wilshire Boulevard of the 30s was envisioned as the city’s “main street” even though it passed through multiple jurisdictions on its way from downtown to the ocean. Some imagined Wilshire could become Los Angeles’s Park Avenue or 5th Avenue. Today in the Wilshire corridor and downtown, residential and mixed-use projects are being built on commercial and industrial parcels that allow high-density housing and are increasingly transit-related. This intensification is also reasonably popular, as most of these developments do not directly impact existing residential neighborhoods. The key to all of this is that there is pent-up demand for multi-family apartments and condos with street-level retail in walkable settings, fueled in part by the urban experience of new generations of immigrants. As perhaps envisioned by planner Hamilton, incremental development has actually happened consistently over time, forming a series of dense urban “nodes” with names known to all, like Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and of course, Hollywood. These urban centers have recently been mapped by Samuel Krueger in a USC graduate student thesis in geography. He concludes that our “centers” are becoming similar to the mix of uses found in Manhattan or the Loop, but in Los Angeles they are much larger geographically and accessible by car, bus and in part, by subway—an example of LA’s unique urbanism. In this view, the city’s “core” now extends from east of downtown to the Pacific, and is now rich in business, religious and cultural amenities as well as a broadened mix of residential options. The Centers Concept, 1974 Courtesy of recode.la, Download the PDF Small, incremental development seems to be the hallmark of Los Angeles. One might almost say that we have a disdain for bigness, quite a contrast from New York City. And while LA lost much of its corporate infrastructure through the 80s and 90s, the city has continued to grow and thrive. Mayor Villaraigosa recently stated that 70 percent of Angelenos are employed by small businesses. Small business is the DNA of the city. Outdoor living is naturally part of our make-up. However, the majority of open space in the city is private with few public parks or strategically placed public plazas for citizens to meet and socialize. When Paul Goldberger arrived here from NYC in the mid 1980s, he remarked to architect Tim Vreeland how private the city seemed. Statistically, we are among the most public open space-deprived cities of the US; we never experienced the “City Beautiful Movement” and other civic initiatives of eastern cities in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Consequently, the quantity and quality of public open space suffered. We need to develop many more and various parks and plazas, gathering places to celebrate our civic and ethnic diversity–for socializing, chance encounters and impromptu business meetings required by the new information economy. As a “creative” place, Los Angeles is very different today than its 1960s self. At the same UCLA conference in 2000 where Hockney made his remarks, aggressive questioning from a youthful audience portended the future: what about the open space of the inner city and in older neighborhoods? Students questioned the so-called “freedom” and inventiveness these places offered the artist. Instead, they cited engagement with the city as creative stimulus, as opposed to his reminiscence of “getting away from it all” in his convertible in the Santa Monica mountains. Still, Los Angeles is second only to New York in population and is the major city of California–the world’s seventh largest economy. There are over 200 languages spoken in Los Angeles and our schools teach in more than 40 languages. LA remains a “creative island,” building on its traditional assets while embracing the new complexities of ethnic diversity, knowledge infrastructure, multi-faceted public transit and urban densification, crafting a new Los Angeles urbanism.

74,Setting the National Stage,https://urbandesignforum.org/setting-the-national-stage/,"September 12, 2012","Editor’s Note: In 2010, the National Park Service announced a plan to refresh and refurbish perhaps the most visible civic space of our democracy, the National Mall, visited by over 25 million people every year. In 2011, the Trust for the National Mall announced a design competition to rethink three of the sites on the Mall: Union Square, with an oversized reflecting pool barring the flow from the Mall to the Capitol Building; the Sylvan Theater on the Washington Monument Grounds, which had been bifurcated by a recent security upgrade; and Constitution Gardens, which had never been fully realized since its inception in the 1970s. The winning proposals will shape the designs of Constitution Gardens and the Sylvan Theater, though issues of jurisdiction will alter the final renovation of Union Square. Christopher Beardsley, Executive Director of the Forum, sat down with three of the finalists to discuss visions for renewing these sites on the Mall: Kathryn Gustafson, representing the Gustafson Guthrie Nichol and Davis Brody Bond’s team for Union Square; Rob Rogers, representing the Rogers Marvel Architects and Peter Walker Partners team for Constitution Gardens; and Marion Weiss, representing the WEISS/MANFREDI and OLIN team for the Washington Monument Grounds at the Sylvan Theater. We’ve also included some comments from Skip Graffam of OLIN, who was unable to join the conversation but who sheds new light on the proposed landscape surrounding the Washington Monument. –DM Washington DC National Mall Chris Beardsley — Redesigning a landscape as present in the public eye as the National Mall is ambitious. What were the most meaningful challenges you set out to resolve as you reworked your individual sites? Winning design for Sylvan Theatre Courtesy of OLIN and WEISS/MANFREDI Rob Rogers — The present physical condition of Constitution Gardens is pretty rough. The work by SOM and Dan Kiley in the 1970s was really an idea structure for a generation of modernity addressing the mall. Unfortunately, it wasn’t executed very well. The soil is disastrous and the topography is actually very mild. We thought that a modern landscape and modern building actually do belong on the Mall. We felt like the conceptual underpinnings of the Kiley-SOM effort were solid, but needed to be re-invented, certainly reconstructed, and the building very much reimagined. Peter Walker and Partners have proposed a soil and garden reconstruction that will develop a landscape that emphasizes the unusual nature of this place with higher topography and a healthy wooded landscape. It also has a lifespan that’s appropriate to the mall. There are 40-year old trees there that are half the size a 40-year old tree should be and that has to do with the at-grade conditions. In that context, we proposed a building in Constitution Gardens. Not a building to compete with other buildings on the Mall, not a monument, not a museum, not a memorial. It’s a parks building. It had to be just enough building to contain the program elements that parks need. The most ambitious and most formal aspect of the building’s program is an overlook into the park itself. You’ll know that you’re entering a secluded and special area that is distinct from the French axial-garden formality of the rest of the Mall. Constitution Gardens is very specifically a respite; it is not full of historical material because it’s only from the 1970s. It’s neither a memorial nor a monument; this is a playful moment on the Mall. Of course, you’re in the context of memorials and monuments. So the building is a shell; it’s not a mass. It’s very light in spirit. It’s horizontal, not vertical. The intent was to let this be a restful, delightful park in the Mall, which is a highly formal place otherwise. Marion Weiss — Alice Pike Barney, the founding donor behind the Sylvan Theater, said that performance and culture belong on the Mall, not just symbolism. She chose the word “sylvan” because it was evocative of the theaters that Shakespeare had described with the magic of the forest. There was no sylvan in the particular proscenium that was created. We felt we could address a couple of things and go beyond. The Sylvan Theater is located dead center between the Tidal Basin with the cherry trees–which are so famous and fabulous–and the formality of the monumental Mall. As such, our project had an opportunity not only to offer a new outdoor theater and a pavilion for food and visitor orientation services, but also connect these two disconnected landscapes. By re-orienting the theater, we are able to create a naturally beautiful sylvan amphitheater through the artifice of elevation. We propose raising the elevation of the amphitheater so that the audience can simultaneously watch the stage but also have a one-of-a-kind view, at the same time, of the Mall and the Washington Monument. The addition of elevation to the amphitheater accomplishes something else: it conceals the tourist bus drop-off area while enhancing the view to the Tidal Basin. Right now, if you’re standing at the Washington Monument and you’re looking in that direction, all you see are buses. Now what you’ll see is a green slope with the Tidal Basin beyond. Furthermore, by introducing trees, we were able to capture the spirit of a sylvan landscape by having a grove of trees rise and descend and offer dappled light into this amphitheater. Moreover, we have added elevation that allows us to cross existing roadways and connect to the Tidal Basin. As a result, we’ll finally link the waterfront and the Mall. The pavilion, together with this amphitheater, maintain a sinuous line that keeps a low horizon and a green roof that make it as much a part of this landscape as it is a piece of architecture. Together they welcome people coming out of tour buses or from the Mall to grab a drink or a bite to eat. Flexibility for a whole range of performances is also at stake. Small performances can take place at one end of the stage, medium performances for up to 1,000 are set within the main amphitheater, and large performances for 10,000 and beyond can leverage the landscape of the site and the Washington Monument’s slope. Within this pavilion, also dappled with light to simulate a tree canopy, there is an interior amphitheater where small performances can operate in all seasons. National Mall competition photo Skip Graffam — One of the central challenges was to insert a variety of new visitor programs in a way that respected and enhanced the iconic landscape of the Washington Monument and cross axis of the National Mall. We knew that this needed to be a solution that read primarily as a landform and not a collection of buildings. The form of the Sylvan Theater flows from the base of the monument, staying below the monument’s entrance plaza level to reinforce the existing composition of the site, key viewsheds, et cetera. The key is that the landscape is flexible and multifunctional. The Sylvan Theater will be a state-of-the-art performance venue in the spirit of Alice Pike Barney’s original vision as well as a destination and attraction when there is not a performance. Kathryn Gustafson — Union Square has two major roles: first, it is the face of the nation and the view of the Capitol. Second, it becomes part of the city for the inhabitants and visitors to enjoy. How do all of these things work together? What happens during large public events like the inauguration? It is really as a place that’s very secure for the Capitol and the inauguration, and yet still open for other uses. It was a complicated piece to design. One goal was to keep the monumental reflecting pool honoring the Capitol and giving monumental termination to the mall. That pool would be very flexible, but at some point, it has to be this monumental gesture that bookends the Lincoln Memorial and the Capitol. We thought it was very important to represent the federal government while recreating this space. The reflecting pool has five flexible segments. Some segments of the new reflecting pool can be in water while others can be in paving. The new design uses a whole lot less water than the current reflecting pool. The proposed system does not throw that water away but holds it and recycles it. The new site will be essentially water-neutral. Rob Rogers — Everyone who saw that scheme was taken aback by its graceful capacity to handle both individuals and massive crowds. Christopher Beardsley — It seems that all of these projects try to straddle the line between activating the existing landscape by adding programs but also leaving it open to embrace spontaneous activities. How did you find the right balance between programming and flexibility? Marion Weiss — That is the opportunity and challenge of doing something in such a public area. The needs will change when there’s a crush of tourists at one moment or at a quieter moment, say, in the winter season. Anticipating adaptability and change in the landscape means considering the emphasis of use and also what it will be like when it’s not being used. We wanted to have a wonderful amphitheater pavilion during performances and otherwise. Flexibility allows our stage to grow and shrink, so a small event and a large event will both feel at home. Its proximity to the Mall means it could be a dining terrace for special events. Landscape is wonderful that way – in its ability to be elastic. Rob Rogers — The Constitution Gardens building is a pavilion by its very nature. It’s a building you go through, not just in. It’s meant to be functional for a small party or for hundreds of users. If you’re asking specifically about flexibility of the landscape, Peter Walker was very intent that the Constitution Gardens be a garden. That distinguishes it from landscapes on the mall. He focused both on how it performs through the seasons and the way it accepts a casual picnicker, a large group of strolling walkers, or ice-skating in the winter. It has vibrancy as well as flexibility. Kathryn Gustafson — Union Square is very different than Sylvan Theater and Constitution Gardens because it’s at the end of the mall. It’s part of the monumental, formal, and civic definition of this space. It has a ceremonial role. The role of each of these places is extremely different from the others: the Sylvan Theater is performance-based, whereas Constitution Gardens is leisure-based. Union Square has a double role. First, being a ceremonial representation of the federal government because it is the reflecting pool of the Congress. At the same time, there’s an important need to make our cities more livable for the everyday residents. So Union Square has to provide spaces of gathering and leisure. Rob Rogers — Union Square is under the most stress: to go from a few people strolling and having an idyllic view of the Mall to withstanding the inauguration. Constitution Gardens is a specific site. Although it may swell with seasons and crowds, it doesn’t have the same radical variation and intensity. Kathryn Gustafson — Constitution Gardens is almost a destination. You have to joyously discover it! It’s this jewel tucked in there. Union Square is at the end of the axis. There’s a lot of pressure on it. It goes from Constitution Avenue to Independence Avenue on either side. It encompasses some very interesting ecological projects: the Botanical Gardens and what we call Site 575, where we’ve proposed a new outdoor museum that explores the natural world and native ecologies. We, as a culture, are looking at the sustainability of our lifestyle, so fittingly this very intense monumental space will be bracketed by these two concerns. National Mall competition photo Christopher Beardsley – That’s a good point. Obviously the National Mall symbolizes the values of our government and ourselves as Americans. What values were you trying to inscribe in the Mall through the projects? Obviously sustainability is a piece of all of them. Skip Graffam — One of the most wonderful things about the National Mall is that it’s our country’s collective stage for celebration, protest, exhibition, recreation, and engagement with our government and collective culture. There is no better place than a theater to continue that sharing and exhibition of culture, through a flexible venue that welcomes all groups to participate. The close connection between our country and the native landscape was celebrated with the reconnection and re-stitching of the fragmented woodland into a sylvan grove that forms the theater and connection of the monument grounds and tidal basin. Marion Weiss — Issues of sustainability are in the foreground of everyone’s thinking today. On one level, we’ve all proposed physical changes that ensure that these buildings and landscapes are sustainable. We have reduced lawns, so that meadow and lawn better complement each other to reduce maintenance. We have rain gardens to collect rainwater runoff so we can reuse it for irrigation. We have the benefits of a green roof, daylight harvesting elements, and so on. The larger question of sustainability is, with 25 million visitors now and in anticipation of that number doubling in the future, how can this be a compelling destination? How will it thrive? To some extent, it means connecting parts of these landscapes that were disconnected. It means making sure that a cafe can support itself so that it is not a burden. We are connecting performance-goers with their community, so that people come to the Mall not just as tourists but as “homeowners” of this “backyard.” Kathryn Gustafson — You’re right: we can create spaces that improve inter-urban living within Washington DC. You’ll take your kids and your grandparents there. You’ll walk there. It’ll be part of your daily life, not just for an occasional fair and then empty again. The Mall will become a more integrated part of the city so that people don’t feel the need to leave the city to find that breath of fresh air, exercise, or whatever it is they’re looking for. Rob Rogers — The wonderful thing about having all three sites part of this competition is that they are distinct types of public space. For us, it was this idea that the Mall is available to anyone who lives and works in the area. For the tourists, it’s actually quite a long haul to make your way from memorial to monument. The memorials are incredibly moving and emotionally exhausting. To have places where you just take a break under a shade tree, by the water, or in a restaurant while in the middle of the Capitol is a way to think about how this can work for many generations. Kathryn Gustafson — These projects also serve as precedent for designing functional and beautiful integrated landscapes in our cities. As the Capitol, there’s an obligation that our projects use state-of-the-art technology, materials and planting ecology. Christopher Beardsley — Being the National Mall, there are obvious security concerns. How did you balance security concerns with maintaining open, connected landscapes? Rob Rogers — At Constitution Gardens, we ended up referring to long-learned rules of personal safety about when people feel comfortable. Our site doesn’t have larger security obligations. We’ve not yet been through the process with the agencies to discuss whether the pavilion will require any special requirements, but we’re going to try not to at this point. Kathryn Gustafson — Union Square is driven by security in many ways. Having worked in DC for quite a few years, there are a couple of key points we had to keep in mind: first, the tried-and-true rules of what make people feel comfortable, and the need for an additional layer of security features. The design adds a second security wall at Third Street, the western perimeter of Union Square, and security measures are integrated into the landscape to make them less visible. Security was one of our main drivers from the very beginning to ensure we could meet the requirements that might be asked of us in the future. Marion Weiss — Security is very important around the Washington Monument. In advance of our design for the Sylvan Theater, OLIN developed a low wall that works around the Monument as an oval, which responds to the core security concerns at the site. Skip Graffam — The balance is achieved when the security elements are rendered invisible or become an amenity, as is the case in the Washington Monument security wall, which serves as a new plinth for the Monument, seating area, and vehicle barrier. National Mall competition photo Christopher Beardsley — This is really the first time that the Mall has been rethought in several decades… Rob Rogers — Really since the 1970s project by Dan Kiley and SOM that was the genesis of both Union Square and Constitution Gardens. It’s interesting that those two sites are both now up for reconsideration. Peter Walker noted that that the landscapes of Constitution Gardens only lasted for thirty or forty years, which is unfortunate. His firm, PWPLA, has really developed the science, technology and craft that can rebuild Constitution Gardens to last for 100+ years. Chris Beardsley — What is the anticipated lifespan of your projects? And how often should the Mall, as a symbol of our nation, be redesigned and reborn? Kathryn Gustafson — We have to be careful, the Mall has suffered constant shrinking. It’s interesting that the Trust for the National Mall has decided to rework existing sites instead of creating new ones. We’re reducing our public domain footprint and we’re reducing our permeable surface footprint. I’m all for rethinking the Mall but not for adding more. There are a couple of places you could add a building, but we are going to just eat this up. It’s happening to parks all over the world, where buildings are starting to encroach. We’re reducing our public domain footprint and we’re reducing our permeable surface footprint. Rob Rogers — In the early 1800s, the population of the entire United States was half of the current visitorship of the Mall. How could you ever have designed for, or even imagined, that kind of usership? Kathryn’s right about the preservation of what is there. We can create places that actually invite and enable congregation. But we don’t know what it’s going to be like 20 or 50 years from now. Marion Weiss — The evolution of this landscape goes way back. The Tidal Basin originally engulfed much of the Mall today, effectively crossing almost to the Washington Monument. The site of the Lincoln Memorial used to be water. Constitution Avenue was a canal. This has been a very vibrant set of transformations from a site of exchange and trade to a site of symbolism. There have been many views of it, from the grove of trees filling the Mall by Andrew Jackson Downing in the 1850s, to the open clarity that emerged with the 1902 McMillan Commission vision. Whether the Mall’s form takes on a symbolic identity or a bucolic identity has evolved through fashion, you might even say. What we’re looking at right now is a landscape that embraces visitors and yet still preserves the legacy of a generous open landscape. Kathryn may be right; to some extent, the Mall can no longer support new structures. The magic of the “between” spaces has become so compressed and roadways have divided the Mall from other landscapes. Collectively, we’ve been looking at how we can construct sites that are leftover bits into elements that can be enjoyed by the public and connect visitors to other landscapes. And that’s where our bridging landscape is hoping to afford continuity between the Mall and its larger context. It’s all part of this new evolution of thinking toward landscape.

75,(In)formal Divides: Africa’s Urban Identity Crisis,https://urbandesignforum.org/informal-divides-africas-urban-identity-crisis/,"July 18, 2012","In 2000, The Economist called Africa the “hopeless continent,” citing political insecurity and international indifference. One year later, African scholar Simone Abdul wrote, ”It is clear that African cities… are nowhere close to being world cities. Rather, they are largely sites of intensifying and broadening impoverishment and rampant informality.” And yet ten years later, The Economist changed its tune, reflecting its newfound optimism in a cover article titled “Africa Rising.” It was with this sense of extraordinary opportunity that urbanists, investors, and politicians met at the end of May for The Economist Future Cities conference to explore possibilities around the exponential growth of Africa’s urban areas and the untapped potential of their largely youthful population. But what is remarkable about contemporary discourse on Africa is not the overwhelming potential of its emerging economy, but the widening dichotomy between the glossy vision of Africa’s future and the informality that defines its urban reality. Held in Lagos, sub-Saharan Africa’s largest and fastest growing urban area, the conference convened mayors, financiers, and developers to discuss perspectives and case studies from around the continent. Lagos Governor Babatunde Fashola was among the keynote speakers discussing the colossal challenge of planning for cities of not just 10 or 15 million, but 40 or 45 million inhabitants. In the case of Lagos, infrastructure built during the modern planning movements of the 1970s has long since been appropriated by her residents; every inch of space has been overrun by congestion, slums, and informal markets. In the meantime, post-independence military leaders and politicians have fed Africans on a diet of unfulfilled promises. This has led skeptical investors to ask: how are cities with a sporadic history of planning, little faith in regulation, and no track record of implementation going to ‘leapfrog’ to design at a scale few other cities have ever seen? Yet at the same time, with Western economies in flux, investors are looking for new opportunities, and African cities are ripe for development. Master-planned development by the private sector (executed largely outside of strategic city plans) is embraced, as in the case of Nairobi’s Tatu City or Lagos’s Eko Atlantic projects. Existing frameworks of land ownership are too confused and utilities too unreliable for in-situ development. These megaprojects come with all the trappings of contemporary urban design: high-tech business districts, luxury shopping malls, private promenades, and endless condominium towers. Their renderings reinforce a global standard (and market-proven tactics) where the objective is to create a commercial product. This type of satellite utopia aims for a kind of autonomy that will isolate residents from the perceived ‘chaos’ and dysfunction of African cities. It remains to be seen if investors will be wooed by presentations like Eko Atlantic, where 9 square kilometers of land has been reclaimed from the Gulf of Guinea and sculpted into development parcels. Eko Atlantic suggests that it is more viable to build a massive piece of land off the coast of Lagos (dredging 10,000 m3 of sand daily and dwarfing similar instances in Dubai) than to intervene in existing physical economies. Beyond environmental concerns, critics doubt the virtues of an imported urban form, out of context and vacant of process. These projects undoubtedly stand to bring significant economic development, but fail to capitalize on any kind of African character and starkly contrast with the contemporary manifestation of Africa’s physical machinery. The “right to the city” becomes an increasingly pertinent question when massive developments like these are rendered exclusive while congestion and services for low-income workers continue to worsen. Without taking a real lesson from history in the west, Eko Atlantic is a kind of ultimate postmodern experiment–an idealized replica of Manhattan, London or Hong Kong. Facing the challenge of housing urban migrants, many would agree with UN-Habitat Project Director Alioune Badine that “government should not be in the business of building houses,” a lesson taken from the failure of socialist housing projects during post-independence dictatorships. It is the absence of a top-down systemic approach to infrastructure that has generated the adaptive ‘self-organization’ widely studied by writers like Rem Koolhaas, Mike Davis and Robert Neuwirth, who have identified the informal networks that exist in cities across the globe, from Rio to Mumbai. Cultural journalist Robert Neuwirth joined the conversation to share his anthropological perspective on the power of the informal in urban life. He observed that some have tried to capture the ‘unofficial’ processes that govern contemporary urbanism in Africa, like Johannesburg mayor Parks Tau, who recently introduced a registration and regulation process for informal vendors. Neuwirth argued that because these transactions are a large portion of the global economy (an estimated $10 trillion a year worldwide), they should be integrated and accepted into the urban fabric. Others would disagree, inferring that African society–where relationships and histories are largely oral–are held up by these billions of personal interactions that cannot be cleanly translated into formal regulatory processes Africa’s mayors in cities like Cape Town, Harare, Dar-es-Salaam, Johannesburg, and Lagos are most in touch with these aspects of city life and are becoming increasingly savvy to sustainable planning principles like nodal development, transit corridors, green space planning, and mixed use. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has been working to use architecture and design to bridge social and economic divides in a community with a deep-rooted history of spatial segregation. Lagos governor Fashola presented a tree planting initiative that he hopes will leverage action from individuals to plant trees in their own neighborhoods. These mayors are keenly aware of the power of urban regulation to support a shared and equitable future – a future that is ultimately defined by the mass of its citizens. While their approach is aimed at change through integration with history, culture, and context, it is in opposition to the commercially driven mainstream that seeks to import and detach. And while the Governor of Lagos claims to endorse a culture of planning, the new Eko Atlantic development is incompatible with most city and environmental regulations. And yet no matter how formal the project may seem, it will not be exempt from the informal processes that characterize the Nigerian city. Eko Altantic will change Lagos, but it is the way that Lagos will change proposed enclaves like Eko Atlantic that may define the future of African cities. The lesson may be what Koolhaas observed during his research on Lagos – when contemporary infrastructures are used in creative and productive ways, largely unintended by the designer. We should welcome Eko Atlantic as a tabula rasa, and watch as it begins to accept the realities f its context–hybridizing tradition, ceremony, and an informal economy with novelty. It should forget that it is trying to keep up with New York and do its best to keep up with Lagos."
76,"Grid, Interrupted",https://urbandesignforum.org/grid-interrupted/,"June 14, 2012","Editors Note: As the Museum of the City of New York celebrates 200 years of the Manhattan grid in its current retrospective, it seemed only appropriate to call upon an architect with a unique opportunity to adapt the city’s grid: Stanton Eckstut, co-author of the 1979 Battery Park City Master Plan. –DM The defining feature of a city–its street and block pattern–is a convenient tool to organize land, circulation, open space, and infrastructure. A city’s street and block pattern gives residents a way to navigate its bounds. When we think of New York City’s street grid, we tend to think of the linearity and right angles of Midtown Manhattan, where there is little distinction between streets and property is equally distributed among every block. This egalitarian parceling of land successfully promotes both movement and competitive property values. Indeed, when laid out in 1811 from Houston Street (then named North Street, as it represented the northern boundary of the city for the vast majority of residents) to 155th Street in Harlem, property values virtually skyrocketed, creating the beginnings of the New York’s obsession with real estate. This orthogonal grid was good for the production of buildings. And even better for developers. Yet this same grid has not been very successful in responding to its unique context: in distinguishing where there is more movement, and where there is less; where large-scale, higher-density development should be promoted; and equally important, where smaller, more intimate environments should be located. The interruptions to and variations on the ”Manhattan Grid” are the true prototypes for making great cities and urban places. In New York, the locations where the diagonal orientation of Broadway intersects with the north-south avenues and east-west streets created Union Square, Madison Square, Herald Square, Times Square, and Columbus Circle. These spaces are about people. They accommodate automobiles, but do not allow them to dominate—creating a much more enjoyable city for people to inhabit. Contrary to what many observers have speculated, the Manhattan grid was not the model for Battery Park City. When Alex Cooper and I designed the master plan in the 1970s, after several previous failed attempts by others to either replicate what was being done elsewhere under very different circumstances, or introduce new, unnatural patterns of development, we focused on the street as the defining element of the neighborhood. We looked upon the buildings as a means of creating public spaces. We took our cues from Lower Manhattan and Broadway with its skewed angle that opened the street to the cooling breezes from the southeast in the summer and offset the cold winds from the northwest in the winter. Battery Park City is successful because of its incredible variety of spaces and blocks, which afford more opportunities for a diversity of experiences and ideas. By design, there is no one street or block in Battery Park City like another. It turns out that this is a good recipe for private development, also, because private development and property value is very focused on public space and on the creation of “addresses.” In its dead ends, its starts and stops, its twisting and changing streets, Battery Park City provides an ever-changing family of independent spaces with distinct identities and opportunities. And when the streets meet the water’s edge, public space is celebrated with prominent public parks and squares, most notably the esplanade. When I begin designing cities and environments for urban placemaking, I might start off with an orthogonal pattern as a simple and helpful tool for organizing development. But, in order to create a unique environment with special addresses and opportunities for interaction within the city, I quickly start to plan for the exceptions. It is these variations that create opportunities for increased real estate values and a more enjoyable city in which to walk and enjoy public life. People’s perceptions of a city are formed by its streets and not its buildings. Streets are where the delights—and petty inconveniences—that define life in the city take place. It is for this reason that neighborhoods with a diversity of streets like Battery Park City offer a greater sense of clarity to how people live and work. In places that have a sense of spatial differentiation, there is a deeper, more intense feeling for the activity associated with that place. It took the rationally planned regularity of the Manhattan grid to marry the entrepreneurial energy of New York with the relentless resourcefulness that has been the hallmark of its inhabitants. But it took the collision of this rationally planned system with the twists and turns of Broadway to produce the places that make life within that grid truly livable.

His work encompasses large-scale development, higher education buildings and plans, schools, transit systems, office buildings, waterfronts and courthouses.

77,Rewriting a City in Nature,https://urbandesignforum.org/rewriting-a-city-in-nature/,"February 15, 2012","Editor’s Note: Check out our review of Diana Balmori’s recent book on the recent integration of architecture and landscape practices, Groundwork. –DM Our understanding of nature has changed radically. Our ideas about urbanism must catch up. By rewriting the city (a semantic departure from “planning”), we will jar the public to this major scientific and philosophical shift in the interaction of nature and the city. Driven by a new understanding of nature as a web of life interdependent with society, we have begun to transform these interactions. Instead of city spaces on one side and parks on the other, separate and fenced apart, we aspire to the mutual regulation of nature and city across porous edges. Instead of humans, plants, and animals, all in their separate boxes as distinct categories, we recognize an interweaving of multiple characters at various scales. Transience is no longer an obstacle to be engineered away; we now embrace it as a tactic for change. Infrastructure is no longer an afterthought, dropped in place after a master plan has been designed; we now face the engineering of public works by mirroring living systems. And rather than remaining preoccupied with only a few aspects of nature or the city, and ignoring the rest, we consider them all to understand how they may be transformed. Our projects in Sejong, Korea, and the Broadway Mall in New York City show how this new approach to landscape will revolutionize urban design. SEJONG GOVERNMENT CITY – SEJONG, KOREA In 2007, in partnership with Haeahn Architects, we won the international competition for the master plan of the administrative city in Sejong, Korea. It comprises buildings for seven ministry buildings, to be moved from Seoul, an office for the Prime Minister, cultural buildings and schools. It is now under construction, with occupancy of the seven structures to start in September 2012 and to be completed by 2013. Korean projects typically begin by flattening the terrain, a natural reflex in a country that is 75% mountains. Korean office buildings loom far above the landscape as isolated towers, floating bureaucracies disconnected from the people on the ground. Our proposal, guided by the principle of “city in nature”, took on these challenges. Our goal was to preserve the two large hills, which bracketed a river, and to uncover the terrain masked by a grid of highways. We also wished to express a new concept of accessible government, characterized by connections with the people and within itself, by limiting the government buildings to six stories. Infrastructure is no longer an afterthought, dropped in place after a master plan has been designed; we now face the engineering of public works by mirroring living systems. The spine of the project—a continuous roof and public green space linking the seven buildings—reflects both concerns. The shape of the roof responds to the river, and, at only six stories above ground level, it can be reached by ramps as well as elevators and seen from above by the surrounding villages, exemplifying accessibility. We have introduced natural regulation into the project by overlaying the highway grid with a much looser system of roads for pedestrians, bikes, and slow traffic. We were also able to preserve one hill through the looser system of roads. To integrate infrastructure as a critical element into our plan, we devised flows and structures to clean and reuse all water on site. Unfortunately, as the site’s energy infrastructure had been determined and partially implemented before the competition, we were unable to execute our ambition for a “Zero City,” a plan to have all energy resources regenerated on site. Our “city in nature” ambition energizes other design goals, like making government physically and visibly accessible. And we see what can be realized by cultivating unconventional urban surfaces—a roof, as in Sejong—so they become dynamic participants in the urban landscape. BROADWAY MALL – NEW YORK CITY, USA The Broadway Mall project was the result of a request by the Broadway Mall Association via Design NYC. With Joel Sanders Architect, we determined that the Mall, stretching from 60th to 168th streets, could be much more than a mere median, amalgamating 100 separate block segments. Instead, we re-envision it as a thriving ecological corridor for New York. We embrace the influence of the surrounding traffic: in our design, the drafts produced by vehicle movements power windmills on the retaining walls of each block, producing electricity to light the entire mall (Oberholzer turbines). And we have designed at multiple scales to make this eco-corridor function at all levels, combining a skyway for insects and birds with a small mammal path traversing under each cross street, and a continuous public walkway. Finally, instead of submitting to a planning and funding process of one or more decades, we’ve devised temporary interventions as a tactic to get moving immediately. We have focused our initial effort on a two-block stretch. This provides a way to begin today, so that ideas can be observed, criticized, and evolved – the kind of dance with nature needed as we enter a new urban era. The Broadway Mall concept can be applied to countless medians, poor Cinderellas of public space, left in most cases as windshield landscapes (e.g. Park Avenue). In many cities, not just New York, they are spines waiting to be knit into a larger whole. From Korea, the “city in nature” idea serves other design goals such as making government physically and visually accessible. We can see also that cultivated urban surfaces can become activators of an urban landscape. This is a beginning. The “city in nature” will be a source of revolutionary change on how a city operates, and for whom. It will be a bricolage of living things under constant change, retaining old parts but endowing them with new functions.

78,No School is an Island,https://urbandesignforum.org/no-school-is-an-island/,"February 9, 2012","Edtior’s Note: The vision of the triumphant Cornell-Technion University plan is teeming with lofty ambitions: tens of thousands of jobs created, millions of square feet in shining, sloping facilities that will completely recoup the campus’s own energy use. It’s certainly not the first time Roosevelt Island was planned with semi-utopian ambition. Will a tech campus accomplish just what Philip Johnson and John Burgee’s 1969 plan could not—endow the island with an identity beyond a clever housing scheme and integrate it into the everyday lives of New Yorkers? For this month’s Roll Call, we sought out three contributors to capture the city’s newfound optimism and challenge the island to go further: Theodore Liebman, who helped develop the Johnson-Burgee plan from the ground up; Gina Pollara, who is currently at work finishing the final piece of the 70’s plan puzzle, a park and memorial designed by Louis I. Kahn; and Laxmi Ramasubramanian, who spearheaded a recent study to evaluate the needs of Roosevelt Islanders. –DM Gina Pollara ▷ 														 Gina Pollara was appointed as the President of the Municipal Art Society early in 2016.

Chanin School of Architecture Archive, and prior to this, she was as an architecture consultant and construction manager for various companies and projects in New York City, California and Florida. 												 	 New Gown in Town Posted on February 9, 2012 The Island is no stranger to reinvention as its successive names attest: first, Varcken (or Hog) Island, then Manning’s, Blackwell’s, Welfare Island, and since 1973, Roosevelt Island. It has been both a place of exile and isolation, but also a place for experimentation. During the 1800s it notoriously housed a penitentiary, a lunatic asylum and smallpox hospital. Long-term nursing care facilities took advantage of the restorative island breezes by the 1920s. The current development of the island follows the 1969 Master Plan by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to transform the island into a vibrant residential community, a “New Town in Town.” Considered visionary at the time, the Johnson/Burgee plan proposed a mixed income, racially-diverse community that was fully accessible to the disabled. Vehicular traffic was eschewed in favor of public buses powered by electricity, and garbage was collected through pneumatic tubes to a central compacting station—ideas ahead of the times still in use today. In 1970, the plan coalesced with a proposal to build a memorial park to President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed by renowned architect Louis I. Khan on the southern tip, and, once again, the island would be reborn. It never quite achieved the aims of the Johnson/Burgee plan, hampered by New York’s financial woes. It was challenging to attract residents to an area with limited public transportation to the greater city. Subway service did not arrive until 1989, and the Island saw a long period of neglect in the 1990s. It has been difficult to attract and maintain storefronts along Main Street. The mid-2000s yielded some signs of revitalization. After years of neglect, the aerial tramway, the subway station, and the Roosevelt Island bridge to Queens were largely overhauled. New buildings brought several thousand more residents along with sorely needed stores and restaurants. A renewed effort in 2004 to build the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park proved successful, and construction began last year. These improvements may have even made it the most desirable site for a new applied sciences campus. The forthcoming applied sciences campus will radically change the character of the island. Goldwater Hospital will soon be replaced by 2 million square feet of classroom and research space, 2,000 students and 300 faculty members. It will create 20,000 construction jobs and 8,000 permanent jobs, generating some $23 billion over 30 years. These are staggering numbers for a narrow island serviced by one main thoroughfare. This is a game-changing plan for Roosevelt Island. Its connection to the larger City has always been tenuous, and yet, this plan promises to put it firmly on the map. The trick will be to balance the needs of what is essentially a small-town residential community with the needs of a big-city university campus.

Connections are Key Posted on February 9, 2012 Today, many great cities throughout the world are seeking the magic formula to create their “Silicon Valley.” I have been involved in the visioning and planning for several of these efforts abroad. I believe Cornell’s new university campus on the southern half of Roosevelt Island, focused on technology, will complete the island’s identity and have a positive impact on the surrounding boroughs, Manhattan and Queens. Roosevelt Island’s new developments will surely encourage, as Alvin Toffler once suggested, the “great growling engine of change—technology.” New York City has all the ingredients to spawn creative thinking and innovation. Roosevelt Island has seven miles of esplanade for contemplation at the water’s edge, the Island’s residents provide a sense of community and humanity, and the restored landmarks imbue a sense of history, with the FDR Four Freedoms park being a particular site of inspiration. In the early 1970s, under the direction of the visionary Edward J. Logue, the NYS Urban Development Corporation created a model for a high-density, mixed-income urban community. Innovative housing, a car-free environment, electric buses and an accessible environment were completed by the 1970s, fast realizing the Johnson-Burgee vision for a “New Town in Town”. Two additional achievements of these early years make Roosevelt Island a uniquely special place: the Tram to Manhattan, made necessary because of the F-subway stop construction delay; and the FDR Memorial Park by Louis I. Kahn, the recent realization of which I consider to be a miracle. Now is the right time to add a major new element to the southern half of Roosevelt Island. The Island has struggled to define its ultimate identity, and I applaud and welcome its partner Technion to the island. An educational and research institution will bring great energy to the island. The concept plan by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill immediately recognizes the island’s two faces, one to Manhattan and one to Queens, taking full advantage of the water’s edge. In its further development, I hope the institution will relate well to the residential community to the north and better define the pathway to the FDR Four Freedoms Park to the south. The pedestrian bridge to Manhattan in the Cornell plan will be a gift to the residents and the university. A second pedestrian bridge extending towards Queens could enhance the waterfront’s development and help Long Island City become an incubator for new businesses. Finally, I would encourage the University and the City to consider the Manhattan site at the landing of the Tram as a renewed gateway to the island, and develop a distinctive architectural identity and program for the underutilized site. Commit to Participatory Planning Posted on February 9, 2012 The idea of a planned community is not new. Many have tried it; some have even achieved great success. It appears that architects and planners like to tell people how and where they should live. As an architect and urban planner myself, I applaud some of these bold visions. Ambitious ideas are necessary to inspire and create much needed change. Yet, the promise of planned communities often contrasts their lived experience. The public only hears about the spectacular failures, but there is always a tension between the designer’s vision and practical realities. Much of the tension arises because designers tend to forget that while their buildings are static, our lives are ever-changing; people move, kids grow up, household compositions change. Our experiences are transformed as we adapt to new innovations, technologies, and employment cycles. And so it is with Roosevelt Island. The vision of a car-free community was ahead of its time and innovations like the AVAC (automated vacuum collection) system emphasized the designers’ celebration of modernist thinking. The buildings still excite architects (don’t architects always design for other architects?) but evoke negative reactions from some residents and visitors who find the environment sterile. And here we are again, thanks to Cornell’s winning bid for a new science campus… the opportunity to envision a new future for Roosevelt Island. Did the idea of a car-free, high-density modernist community really work? Will it work in the future, when the proposed changes actually take effect? Are we going to make it a showpiece campus for visitors, or are we going to focus on creating a vibrant environment for the needs of science education and research? When our Hunter College students conducted the 2009 Roosevelt Island Accessibility Study, they spent a lot of time talking to Roosevelt Islanders about their experiences. They learned that residents are not a passive lot by any means. Roosevelt Islanders are well-informed, articulate and care about the neighborhood and community they have nurtured over the years. Planners for the future would do well to learn from current residents who know what works well and what needs improvement. The Hunter College study identified a lack of coherence in planning for the Island’s development. Resident’s quality of life on the island could be improved by expanding the retail corridor, improving on-island urgent care services, providing fresh food options, creating a bike share program, and protecting access to public spaces. Finally, the transportation networks for getting on and off the island were limited and unreliable, given the complexities of the island’s geography and demographics. While the engineers consider the infrastructure issues and the designers propose visually and technologically sophisticated buildings, I am concerned about whether we are adequately considering the needs of current and future residents. Does the creation of a university campus mean that Roosevelt Island will become a playground for young urban professionals? Will residents have a voice in shaping the scale and character of the developments or will these visions be imposed from the outside? Answering this question will go a long way in creating a design program that works, not just in the short term, but one that will endure for decades to come. A simple way to begin is to make a commitment to participatory planning principles: fairness, by ensuring that all participants have equal opportunity to offer ideas and advice; respect, by recognizing participation of individuals and groups regardless of their particular views; inclusion, by including voices of those directly affected by the planning process as well as who were not able to participate; relevance, by focusing citizens’ testimony, advice, and deliberation on substantive issues; and competence, by using the skills and knowledge of participants to improve the creation of plans. Participatory planning as described above is not easy. It requires a deep political commitment that emphasizes planning with people, rather than planning for people."
79,Rurbanism: A New Model for African Development,https://urbandesignforum.org/7521-2/,"December 19, 2011","It is projected that by 2025, 200 million Africans will migrate to urban areas due to political neglect and changing global economic patterns. Colonial-era policies have dismantled functioning agricultural systems of access and land ownership, while rampant environmental degradation caused by erosion, loss of biodiversity, pollution, and poor water management have diminished the productivity of farming. This failing agriculture sector means that many African countries now import vast quantities of staples such as fish, rice, wheat, and corn at the detriment to local enterprise. Scholars, most interested in the African megacity, often neglect a key feature of African societies: migration has resulted in a highly mobile rural society with increasingly urbanized relationships, rather than a strict urban/rural dichotomy. Despite an overwhelming focus on the megacity, some scholars, including Director of the African Centre for Cities Professor Edgar Pieterse, project that in the next wave of African development “relatively small settlements of less than half a million people will dominate the urban landscape.” McKinsey Global Institute also recently issued a report that promises a similar evolution in global economic growth patterns; approximately 400 mid-size cities in emerging markets – mainly sub-Saharan Africa – are posed to generate nearly 40% of global economic growth over the next 15 years. It is still unknown how this shift in regional economics will formalize spatially, since much of African growth over the last 50 years is informal development. While the biggest cities, such as Lagos, Kinshasa, and Cairo, struggle with reputations short on livable qualities, smaller cities with moderate populations show reduced pressures on housing and infrastructure and can offer less congestion and improved health to their residents. These moderately-sized urban areas maintain social and economic density with efficient land uses, but have smaller ecological footprints and increased ability to sustain themselves with regional crops and self-managed water supplies. It is the point of intersection with urban and rural that has captured my own imagination as an urban designer and as a project team member with the Chife Foundation. Working in partnership with community groups, we have designed a system that uses form-making to harmonize traditionally distinct operations and maximize land use efficiency, social enterprise, environmental integrity and ultimately economic sustainability. Our team’s urban design strategy is “rurban;” a hybridization of the best of urban and rural sectors in which a dense, linear composition of synergistic and ecological interventions are mixed with farms, wetlands, and agro-industry. We use existing mobile technologies to bring information and traditionally ‘urban’ opportunities to remote locations outside of the physical urban center. Rather than waiting for the government to arrive with roads or power plants, the Anam people have embraced a DIY attitude and are aiming to create a sustainable city from the local resources they have within the bounds of their land. The Anam people of eastern Nigeria are one such community that is actively defining this new rurban paradigm for modern Africa without the help of government. While classified amongst the world’s poorest, the Anam are highly organized with several tiers of councils, unions and forums. These community groups have been engaged in a discussion of how to improve the lives of their families, provide jobs for their youth and create a “rebirth” of their community. Building a new settlement is not new concept to the Anam; since the 19th century the Anam have established new towns as they grew in population. Because these small towns are not classified as urban or rural by the government, they are overlooked and never receive any formal development or infrastructure. The Anam Development Council has raised resources within the community for a planned new town known as “Anam City” for 30,000 people. This project is being developed in partnership with the Dr. Aloy & Gesare Chife Foundation, a Nigerian NGO. A unique model of development, largely influenced by the Anam’s livelihood as farmers is defined in the Anam City Master Plan: an off-grid, decentralized, locally-sourced, culturally-dense settlement that is also agriculturally intense. The development process is also unconventional. Rather than waiting for the government to arrive with roads or power plants, the Anam people have embraced a DIY attitude and are aiming to create a sustainable city from the local resources they have within the bounds of their land. We at the Chife Foundation are working with a local development group to design business models for an earth block factory, a fish farm, hospital, school, affordable housing, a market place and an illo (plaza). This way, workers can have an “urban” lifestyle and access while cultivating farmland. The long-term vision is a constellation of similar mid-sized dense cities that are interconnected by waterways and economic relations. Implementation of the Anam New City project began in early 2011.

Editor’s Note: Urban design was charged with elevated responsibility as the towers tragically fell on September 11, 2001. Among the conflicts of rebuilding New York’s reputation and economy after the catastrophe, the most urgent question that emerged concerned the organization of urban space: how to respect the memory of the towers and those victimized that day through the relationships of open spaces, building footprints, and street traffic. Urbanists would eventually carve through the superblocks that eschewed the city’s historic grid, soften the mid-century modernism championed by Minoru Yamasaki but beloved by few, and pierce through former footprints to build a memorial worthy of the occasion. For this month’s Roll Call, we consider: Did urban design live up to its newfound expectations? Were the greatest accomplishments at Ground Zero economic, architectural, or urban? What were the blunders we might have avoided? We approached three Fellows of the Forum who were intimately involved in rebuilding Ground Zero—Peter Walker, Alex Garvin, and Vishaan Chakrabarti—to reflect on decision-making over a decade of reconstruction in Lower Manhattan. –DM Vishaan Chakrabarti ▷ 														 Vishaan Chakrabarti is a registered architect and the founder of PAU.

Of the book, the Toronto Globe and Mail wrote: “In the world of urbanism and planning, there’s been a barrage of recent books on similar themes…but Mr. Chakrabarti has written maybe the most useful one, a polemic in favor of city living that makes the stakes clear.” Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradlee named A Country of Cities one of the top ten books of 2013 in the Huffington Post. 												 	 It's the streets! Posted on December 5, 2011 Progress at WTC? It’s the streets! Without question, the most successful decision in the urban design process for the World Trade Center site was the most difficult to achieve—the re-introduction of the street grid. Standing today on Greenwich Street between Fulton and Liberty, at the nexus of TriBeCa and the burgeoning residential neighborhood to the south, one is reminded of the resonance of the most fundamental building block we have as a physical city, our streets. It is a powerful experience, and it is thrilling to know it will soon be a public experience. The fight to create the streets was long and untoward, led by a brilliantly coordinated move by the City, LMDC, SOM, and Silverstein Properties to reconfigure 7 WTC – downtown’s most beautiful recent office building – to allow for Greenwich to reconnect. The fight continued with east-west streets, particularly Fulton, to bring a newly residential financial district westward, ultimately to the Hudson. The character of Dey and Cortlandt Streets remains uncertain… while agreements exist to keep them open, and I among many fought to keep them so, it’s unclear what their experience will yield as they slope furiously towards the water, and form the new canyons of Lower Manhattan between soaring new buildings. Problems at WTC? It’s the camel! It is famously said that a camel is a horse designed by committee. The examples of this at the site are all too prevalent, but the most glaring is the visitors’ center designed by Snohetta. This normally brilliant architecture firm was put in an impossible position, designing a building with the wrong program in the wrong location for the wrong time. The only true purpose this building serves is to shield all the magnetometers from the rain, as visitors troop through the center and must have their bags and bodies examined. But even this mundane program could have been better located, in a building to the southwest of the site, which could have engulfed the mammoth concrete PATH ventilation structures that now loom over West St. (The much-trumpted “Champs Elysees” of Lower Manhattan!) Instead, the folly dominates the corner of Fulton and Greenwich, declaring itself where silence would have been the better sound. It’s presence almost robs Arad’s memorial of its power, allowing views of the footprints that it shouldn’t, while using the architectural vocabulary of 90’s Libeskind no less literally than Gehry does of Utzon. The examples of design by committee are omnipresent: the replacement of inexpensive but beautiful jet mist stone at the base of the footprints with concrete; the inclusion of a cooling system behind the bronze plaques of the victim’s names, all so some lawyer could sleep easy in an expensive bed; the cheapening of the base of One World Trade Center. All of these moves make us question whether we, as a society, can achieve greatness at scale. But in the end, there will be the streets. And with the streets, come the City, and with the City comes its ultimate promise, the unknown. Alexander Garvin ▷ Greenwich Street Posted on December 5, 2011 The most significant achievement in the reconstruction of the World Trade Center has been the re-creation of Greenwich Street as an artery running through the site, re-connecting Tribeca directly with the financial district. Security considerations may initially restrict vehicular traffic passing through this rebuilt World Trade Center. A century from now, however, all the buildings on the redevelopment site will have become fully integrated with the rest of lowerManhattan and Greenwich Street and its main artery will be filled with the trucks, buses, taxis, private automobiles and pedestrians that were once excluded from the site. The most regrettable decision over the past decade has been the expenditure of over $21 billion in public funds without any public accounting or public participation in the decision-making process since the adoption of the Libeskind Plan in February 2003.

Vents, water, power and sustainability Posted on December 5, 2011 We had to make many difficult decisions about the Memorial, difficult because the project has been so complicated and so contentious. On the positive side three issues come to mind, all of which have resulted in improvements that a visitor to the memorial will probably never be aware of. Vents: The memorial sits on top of the equivalent of a seven-story building that includes a parking garage, a chiller plant, a shopping center, and a museum. Calatrava’s station sits under the northeast corner, connected to eleven subway lines. All of these uses require air intakes and exhaust vents. At first the engineers said they required seventeen vents, and the vents had to be forty-feet high—up in the trees—because someone might throw a bomb down them. We tried to negotiate, but the engineers and the security people were adamant. So we made a model in our office, and we put all the vents in the proposed positions, and we painted them orange. This is what we now call the “awful model.” We took this to Governor Pataki, and I told him what was happening, and he said, “That looks awful.” He turned to the engineers from the Port Authority, and he said that we couldn’t have any of those things, that they were not acceptable. The engineers said that maybe they could eliminate one or two and maybe we could “decorate” the rest. And the governor said no, we couldn’t have any of them at all. This decision required rerouting exhaust- and intake-systems across the seven-story area below the plaza and putting them all into two structures over on the west side. And so the vent structures on the west side of the park were born, and the flat plaza of the memorial was preserved. Water and power: The fountains in the voids posed a greater design problem than expected. For an even flow across the weir a waterfall requires about a half inch to an inch of water. This means that the huge fountains of the voids would require many gallons of water to fall across the weir. Of course when it was falling, the water would use no energy, but it would have to be pumped back up to go across the weir again, and the electricity to pump this enormous amount of water would cost many millions of dollars a year, really an incredible amount. We had done a number of waterfalls and we had always worked with our fountain consultant Dan Euser. Now Dan figured out that you could put a series of tooth elements on the memorial weir, like a comb, so that as the water fell it would change from a sheet of water to a series of small water falls, thousands of small water streams that would look very much like a regular waterfall, but use less than half the amount of water and therefore reduce the operating cost by a substantial amount. This was a huge contribution. It kept the waterfalls from being economically unfeasible. Dan was really a hero. He built a full-scale mock-up in his backyard in Toronto and proved that this system would work. Sustainability: Another reason trees last such a short time in New York City is that they are usually planted in a hole in hard-packed soil. For trees this is like putting down roots in a concrete box. Even if they don’t fall over and die or defoliate, they don’t grow very well. We wanted to make a setting for the trees that would encourage their growth and health. Trees not only take in food through their roots; they also take in air. So we designed a engineered soil with thousands of small air spaces that help the roots grow. And we planted the trees not just in boxes but in long trenches that run across the memorial from east to west and give the trees enough soil to grow and to thrive within the City. We also designed a series of drains that go completely across the memorial east to west. Those drains catch every drop of rain water and snow melt that falls on the plaza. The water is taken down below the seven stories and stored in two 150,000-gallon tanks, one for the north void, one for the south. Collection takes place in the rainy season; then in the dry season that water is pumped back up and used for irrigation of the trees, grass, and ground cover. This system creates a sustainable cycle, probably the largest mechanical sustainable system ever built in New York City. If I have one regret it is the removal of the liquidambar trees. They were to surround the glade where people will gather to read the names every September 11. Unlike the swamp white oaks in the rest of the plaza, the liquidambars would have turned red by that date every year, suggesting a natural parallel to human emotion. They were removed because the architect felt that they competed for attention with the voids that mark the locations of the World Trade Center towers. We thought they were entirely different, natural elements reminding us of the cycles of death and rebirth."
