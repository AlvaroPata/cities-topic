Across the world practitioners are evaluating how this global goal might be locally realised. In high rise, high density, sub-tropical cities like Hong Kong it’s already clear that we will need to use a highly integrated set of design interventions and new practices. Arup has used a recent design competition to see what a net zero approach might involve. For solutions to scale and have a tangible effect on cities as a whole, we need to think broadly about how architecture, landscape and public realm design elements can contribute to net zero in an integrated fashion. Our award winning 2021 submission for Hong Kong’s Advancing Net Zero Ideas competition, is a scheme called ‘Taikoo Green Ribbon’ which embodies green design, human experience, ecology and sustainability within a coherent and bold net zero architectural design approach. To view this video, you must enable cookies. This project’s ambitious sustainability credentials and use of emerging technology also poses tangible challenges to developers’ traditional assumptions – particularly about cost, risk and the form of buildings the world will need. Regulation - the innovative design tool? In geographically constrained cities like Hong Kong, space is costly, and building is always about density and vertical potential. To date, developers have understandably found it hard to achieve commercially viable, environmentally focused designs, within these constraints. To make the leap to the environmental outcomes and performance we want to see, we will need to see government regulation evolve to make less emissions intensive building typologies commercially viable. Regulators and policy makers can make this change more appealing by communicating that net zero buildings’ inherent focus on nature and greenery mean they’re a new way to improve the urban experience for everyone. And suppliers across the building sector need to demand and develop innovative, cost-effective, carbon-neutral construction processes and products. This is an agenda Arup and its partners are pushing. As an industry we must be honest, net zero means shifting expectations to new, unfamiliar norms for building design and operation. There are new considerations for users too. On Taikoo Green Ribbon we concluded early on that natural ventilation must replace powered air conditioning and temperature control as far as possible, with implications for the physical design and human experience. Eight principles guided our thinking on the design of Taikoo Green Ribbon – by tightly integrating them Taikoo could become net zero within 8 years of operation. These key principles are like the DNA of a net zero building scheme, and like DNA they rely on unity – we won’t achieve net zero if we only concentrate on the easy or inexpensive parts. As a goal, net zero requires that we bring together low-energy technology, waste reduction, material reuse and recycling, to design a scheme that is socially inclusive, flexible and adaptable for tenants. Taikoo Green Ribbon is ultimately informed by social, ecological and biodiversity objectives drawn from the UN Sustainable Development Goals, from its surrounding landscape to its façade. Net zero is a chance to do everything better. Innovations at every level With the design of Taikoo Green Ribbon complete, we drew a number of conclusions. First, ideas like ‘biophilic design’, where nature plays a meaningful role in the design and experience of the built environments, is likely to become a hallmark of truly net zero projects. The ethos offers so many benefits, in terms of visitor/user experience and human health and wellbeing, that the approach symbolises much of the net zero agenda’s true meaning. Our second lesson is the building should be a generator not just a consumer of energy. The opportunity to generate the building’s own energy from its façade in algae-powered cells or from rooftop solar/wind turbines, are core design attributes, not ‘nice-to-have’ options. Taikoo Green Ribbon’s use of new curved solar panels, means it can generate more power, for longer each day – leading to energy self-sufficiency within the building. Third, the focus on the surrounding landscape is about paying attention to the human experience of architecture, and a recognition that it can encourage more sustainable, healthy and socially inclusive outcomes among the public. At Taikoo Green Ribbon the building’s green design extends out into landscaped public gardens beyond – giving the building a more inclusive role in the neighbourhood immediately around it. These are enlightened opportunities we should almost always be making the most of. “ For solutions to scale and have a tangible effect on cities as a whole, we need to think broadly about how architecture, landscape and public realm design elements can contribute to net zero in an integrated fashion. ” Dennis Ho Director and East Asia Architecture and Urban Design Leader Responding to 'the everything problem' This is because climate change itself is a set of integrated and always developing problems, leading to related risks and threats. As a force reshaping our thinking, it requires that we respond in kind, finding ways to maximise the reductions in emissions, encouraging new and more sustainable public behaviours and preferences, making more thoughtful bets about the form of built and natural environment we want to live and work in. On Taikoo Green Ribbon, the new technologies themselves, the design and materials choices made are all valid, relevant responses to the ways climate change challenges traditional assumptions. But perhaps the greatest lesson of our work designing the scheme, is the commitment we must make to integrate all these factors – the social, natural, economic, material, commercial and environmental – within a proposed design. Sustainable and social – new roles for development Net zero challenges every aspect of human civilisation, requiring new behaviours and changed preferences that in turn require new forms of physical infrastructure (or radical retrofitting). Exemplar projects can help us to make these changes manifest and real for the world to learn from. But there’s a bigger goal too. For Taikoo Green Ribbon, our workplace design put the users’ wellbeing at its heart, addressing the work environment and comfort. We can already see that the net zero ethos could lead to improved social interaction, better wellbeing and health outcomes, enhanced biodiversity and ecology and spur many other beneficial technical innovations. The recent pandemic has shown us that, faced with a common threat, people are actually far more amenable to change than many thought. There’s a new open-mindedness among clients about what a building is for, how flexible it needs to be and a growing awareness that it must be experience-driven if it’s to retain value long-term.

1,"Planting an idea: Tirana's radical, orbital green vision",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/planting-an-idea-tiranas-radical-orbital-green-vision,,"Becoming a more sustainable city means many different things, depending on which city and country you’re talking about. In Tirana, Albania, a city that has seen rapid development since the early 1990s, there’s a clear need for a green reboot. Traffic congestion and pollution, poor air quality, flood resilience, urban heat, low green space per capita, and the effects of urban sprawl have come to challenge life in the capital. In a bold and forward-looking move, the Mayor of Tirana, Erion Veliaj, working with Stefano Boeri Architects, has put forward a new green, orbital forest as a solution to these issues. The forest - a proposed ring around the urban perimeter of the city with a mix of forests, shrubland, agricultural land and recreational areas – is a nature-based solution that is intended to put a brake on urban sprawl, reconnect the citizens with nature, clean the air, address urban heat effects, and is just one part of a wider plan for the city’s future. “ Greening our city is a clear priority. As recently as five years ago, Tirana had zero playgrounds. We examined unused spaces across the city, listening to parents, children, teachers, to understand what was needed and where. Today, we have 70 playgrounds. ” Anuela Ristani, Deputy Mayor, City of Tirana Making the case for a forest Arup is supporting Tirana to build both the economic and technical case for the Tirana Orbital Forest, bringing landscape architects, ecologists, climate change specialists and economists together to assess the whole value case for our clients: Tirana and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is considering a loan to support the project. Arup’s work includes quantifying the wider environmental and economic benefits that the forest will bring such as improved resilience to floods, human health benefits from improved air quality to increased local economic activity and tax revenues stimulated by the provision of new recreational facilities. The project is a follow-on investment from Tirana’s Green City Action Plan (GCAP), developed through the city’s participation in the EBRD Green Cities programme. Tirana was one of the first cities to join the programme, with Arup selected as the experts to help the city develop their GCAP. The GCAP identified the Orbital Forest as a critical investment for Tirana to address its challenges relating to climate resilience, mitigation, urban sprawl and access to green space. Arup has developed an approach for quantifying the Orbital Forest’s benefits at scale supported by machine-learning tools that help establish the feasibility and commercial viability of such major green infrastructure projects. Our Land Use Machine Learning tool can carry out detailed classifications of nature and land uses from satellite images. It is so powerful it can distinguish between a tree nursery and a forest. Digital tools like this are enabling us to make investments in nature more practical and credible to funders and clients alike. Planting the infrastructure Tirana Orbital Forest is an important milestone in the EBRD’s mission to support investments in nature-based solutions. The Bank recognises the economic benefits green infrastructure can have in comparison to traditional, grey interventions. As a part of EBRD Green Cities, and as acknowledgement of these benefits, the project will receive support from the Green Climate Fund’s concessional resources made available to Green Cities like Tirana. It’s a remarkable development, one that demonstrates how the EBRD supported GCAPs can translate into implementing green infrastructure at scale. Our work to date has been to assess the benefits of different forest options and scenarios the city could adopt. Our approach centres around four key principles: to protect existing landscapes, connect people and ecology to and through the Orbital Forest, restore degraded landscapes and habitats, and provide places for people. 1 of 2 The forest is a proposed ring around the urban perimeter of the city with a mix of forests, shrubland, agricultural land and recreational areas Prioritising nature-based solutions and ‘green infrastructure’ We believe that the Tirana Orbital Forest could be the poster project that makes the wider financial case for green infrastructure, bringing vital new funding and investment sources to this nature-based approach. This is important, because as the world attempts to develop climate change adaptation measures, it’s vital to avoid overreliance on traditional grey infrastructure for issues like flooding. Further, the emissions involved in building more physical barriers mean we would simply be compounding the problem of climate change. Nature-based solutions offer so many different benefits, from storm water mitigation, to improved air quality, promoting biodiversity, and reducing the urban heat island effect. Greenery has a powerfully positive effect on quality of life for people too and adds in this way to the resilience of a city and its people. As a project, Tirana Orbital Forest is still at an early, but exciting stage. We plan to shape the project’s future phases and are keen to share what we learn with other cities that are ready to embrace green infrastructure. “ Nature based solutions like the Tirana Orbital Forest are effective climate measures that address both global and local environmental challenges. We hope that this project can set an important precedent for EBRD and other financial institutions to demonstrate the economic incentives of such investments, and will spur further investment in this space. ” Dr. Nigel Jollands, co-lead of EBRD Green Cities Find out more Expertise Sustainable development advisory Sustainable development and the growing impact of climate change are now priorities for every kind of business.

2,Relighting and rewilding our environment,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/relighting-and-rewilding-our-environment,,"In the global sweep of urbanisation over the last 150 years, the presence of reliable public lighting has been a brilliantly visible sign of human society’s mastery of its environment. Not for nothing do commentators comparing the relative developmental fortunes of North and South Korea usually display aerial photos, a blaze of light in the South, continuous darkness in the North. However, in the last twenty years, concern has been rising about the secondary and negative effects of our ability to relentlessly light the environment we share. We have begun to grasp that ‘light pollution’ has wider and more significant impacts on the natural world and is beginning to undermine our other goals. With understandable calls to protect precious biodiversity and even initiatives to ‘re-wild’ areas where human development has upset the balance between humans and nature, lighting is beginning to be recognised as a key factor deserving a reappraisal. Brightness grows Light pollution is reckoned to be growing at about 2% per year across the developing world. Increasing light pollution produces change in ways analogous to climate change, causing fundamental damage to flora, fauna and ecosystems. Under increased levels of artificial light, night-time pollinators are 62% less likely to visit flowers (moths specifically), marine animals such as sea turtles struggle to breed and birds’ migratory patterns are disrupted. Artificial lighting’s pernicious effects on animal development and population levels brings the issue into conflict with emerging regulatory requirements that new developments must protect and promote biodiversity. Light is no longer an issue that can be ignored and from France and Germany, to Australia and New Zealand, environmental regulators are starting to respond, gaining insights from activists and scientists, and drawing conclusions. Take the French government’s 2018 decree on light pollution, which looks to regulate “excessive disturbance to persons, fauna, flora or ecosystems, causing energy wastage or preventing observation of the night sky.” The decree sets an impressively comprehensive definition of acceptable levels of artificial lighting across the urban and natural environment. Perhaps more importantly, it’s a clear indication of how regulation can be applied in a thoughtful and effective manner, setting standards for other nations to emulate. As ever, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide further stimulus to action on the issue. Light pollution falls squarely under the SDGs 14 and 15 with their focus on the protection of ecosystems on land and in the water. A solvable problem Unlike climate change issues, light pollution is relatively easy to minimise, as if by ‘a flick of a switch’. The causes are all within our control and once we recognise the problem, it’s possible to take a more measured and thoughtful approach to the artificial lighting of our world. We can find a workable way of championing ecology and protecting biodiversity while providing comfortable urban lighting and feeling of safety at night. Furthermore, efforts on this issue will also reduce energy use, lower the harmful effects of light pollution on human health and promote our connection with the natural world. So, how do we achieve this new balance? The short answer is that we need to take a more nuanced and inclusive initial approach to the way lighting is designed into development schemes, where a range of natural and environmental considerations shape the specification from the very start. 1 of 2 In Sydney a staircase integrates lighting at a low level and within paths, providing functional use but not overlighting Rule one: let the night happen One of the most direct impacts on nature is that continuous urban lighting effectively undermines the differentiation between day and night. The design fix for this is to build greater control and flexibility into the way urban lighting is operated, seen in the Kemeralti Masterplan. Clearly we need to balance the need for public safety with the existing overuse of lighting according to a fixed schedule. We could easily decide to become more forensic about how lighting is implemented. In more social areas of a town or city, you might opt to make sure Friday night lighting operates later, but not in the rest of the week. The ultimate goal is to change cultural perceptions of lighting, encouraging a more critical approach in the general population. Actually, we can see how this can take hold. A 2021 study showed that 95% of Parisians polled felt that the city centre was over-lit. A French parkour group has even made turning off urban lighting part of its nightly activities. Perhaps a hunger for change is building. Rule two: carry out a truly holistic assessment Initial assessments should align architecture, lighting design with biodiversity analysis, such as the road lighting at Centrale As. Every location’s ecology is particular and different and those needs must be understood. The central change in thinking here is that we don’t need to see urban development and championing biodiversity as being essentially in conflict. The growing interest in ‘rewilding’ initiatives have set in motion a reassessment of the impacts of urbanisation on the natural world. Commitments to biodiversity net gain will mean encouraging nature to flourish in new places too, something we won’t achieve if artificial light is allowed to disrupt natural rhythms for plants and animals. A more enlightened approach to lighting fits within this same narrative of finding new harmony between human development efforts and protecting the natural world. Making it happen As ever, the challenge is to somehow change norms from within our industry and establish a new definition of what good urban lighting is – it means establishing a new ethos, one that’s shared by the public, commercial operators, suppliers and regulators alike. Incentives do exist, and we believe that the approach offers reputational rewards to organisations that proudly embrace it, helping to build an organisation’s ethical bottom line. As we discussed at the start, regulators are beginning to have lighting in their sights. Here in the UK the government has recently debated updates to the Environmental Bill, looking at potential light pollution reduction targets. An All Party Parliamentary Group has formed to investigate the issue further. With biodiversity net gain increasingly a legal requirement on major schemes, it feels inevitable that light pollution will soon be in the spotlight.

3,What if the client was everyone? How social value can transform urban development,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/what-if-the-client-was-everyone-how-social-value-can-transform-urban-development,,"As we walk around our cities, we often pass building sites with bright, breezy hoardings, announcing a new development, a mix of residential, retail, offices or restaurants. We often see these new developments as symbols of growth and progress, and more often than not we overlook the more complex implications they might have for the communities and neighbourhoods that surround them. Fortunately, urban development in the UK has begun taking a more systematic approach to the social value dimensions of new schemes, a change being driven by a combination of factors. The Social Value Act of 2012, and later the UK Government’s Procurement Policy Note in 2020 (PPN06/20), have redefined what contractors and developers must consider, include and produce. With other global issues like inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, pandemic recovery, the switch to net zero development, and the enduring need to tackle growing wealth inequality, there has never been a more important time to focus on social value. Learning by trying In reality, social value isn’t some intangible new agenda for the built environment industry to consider, just a more joined up way of approaching dimensions of their work they were always shaping (for good or ill). To prioritise social value in scheme design and planning is simply a recognition that a place is always its people and that they all have a stake and a voice. While legislation and procurement policies have started to include social value considerations into development, there is a danger that we focus on responding to the procurement questions in front of us and not on the people and communities that the development will ultimately impact. At Arup we have been reflecting on what we think social value really means, looking beyond procurement implications. The pandemic has provided many useful insights. The sudden rediscovery of localism, of our reliance on our neighbours, green spaces and public conversations underscore the attention we should pay to the inherently interconnected nature of individuals’ lives, the communities they form, the services they use, the employment opportunities they gain, and the infrastructure that makes it all possible. In short, we should never ‘build in isolation’. Our own projects have shown us how important the voice of the community can be. Sometimes the assumptions both we and our clients make about the local benefits of a scheme, will miss the mark. When we listen more closely to members of that community, they tell us something different. In a given setting, the inclusion of balconies facing each other facilitating neighbourly chats to combat loneliness can be more important than delivering STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workshops at a local school. In another setting, offers of apprenticeships for future construction jobs to a community with low levels skills and employment, remain vacant because they’d actually prefer access to apprenticeships with high tech firms around the corner. And ideas like bringing in new local restaurants and cafes can actually have a negative overall impact on a neighbourhood, if they don’t also cater to local cultures, tastes and incomes. These examples make clear how the process must be community-led. If social value outcomes are to genuinely be achieved, we must ask the right questions of the right people at the right time. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Social value means… a focus on people’s quality of life. That means health and wellbeing, education, opportunity, housing, social connections, civic engagement, and other beneficial outcomes that a scheme might support or produce. Shaping social value thinking So, how do we stay focused on what matters? How do we avoid one-size-doesn’t-fit-anyone initiatives? At Arup, we believe there are a few obvious guiding principles: 1. End short-termism Much of what has traditionally undermined social value in development is a lack of endurance to initiatives, leading to a kind of tokenism. We won’t have achieved genuine social value by offering a few short-term construction jobs for local people during a scheme’s development. A better approach, for example, would be for a project team to set up a new local contractor, one that could find other projects for its employees when the current one completes. Another idea is to develop a long-term social value agreement with the community and build it into the lease, to ensure that the community has a voice long after the development is complete. A community land trust – such as The Knowle West Media Centre project called ‘We Can Make’ – can be established to set up a Community Design Code to ensure the design and planning of housing is in line with community requirements, but also so that the new housing gets transferred to community ownership for long-term community oversight and management. The crucial distinction is to view the project as a powerful social lever, not just an opportunity for charitable gestures. Procurement practices and regeneration plans can help set new standards here; cities, local authorities, governments, and the private sector have the ability to push for longer term outcomes in their specifications. For example, the city of Boston has created a Community Benefits Agreement with a developer, as part of the extension of Boston’s light rail and associated real estate development. This enabled them to include agreements on affordable housing, local jobs, workers’ rights, small business initiatives, community resources, open space, arts and culture, public safety, and participatory planning in the redevelopment. It shows how ambitious we could and should be. 2. Move from box ticking ‘engagement’ to genuine co-creation Traditionally, most projects carry out some stakeholder engagement, before moving into the design and development phase, then follow-up with a final check-in, late in the programme. A more socially valuable approach would be to ask the community what they actually need and would like to see. It also means bringing community leaders into the governance structure of a scheme, to ensure their voices aren’t lost as the project progresses. A number of cities – starting with Belo Horizonte in Brazil and then Mexico City and New York – have embraced this kind of approach through participatory budgeting, enabling more deprived communities to have a say in where and how city budgets are spent. This type of approach might sound a fanciful leap for commercial developers to take, but there are benefits to an enlightened approach. Bringing the community onside more fundamentally and continuously lowers the level of objections and planning headaches for developers. It’s a process that builds local understanding and engagement within the community, strengthening social resilience as a result. For developers, reputational gains are huge when projects succeed in a more enlightened way. 3. Social value can't be an offset To count as ‘socially valuable’, it’s not enough for developers to engage in divisive designs, while offering disconnected financial remedies or investments to compensate for a lack of social value inherent within the design itself. The focus on social value must lead to solutions that recognise the existing fabric of the community, not drive further isolation and separation, and ensures that social value is intrinsic to the project itself. For example, adding in social housing to secure planning approval, but failing to consider and collaborate on how to integrate the social housing with the privately owned properties, misses the real opportunity to foster and deepen a shared sense of community. 4. Focus on quality of life If social value is all about real improvements in real lives, planners and developers must work with communities to understand the relevant quality of life issues impacting people. At Arup, we think social value is really just a way of focusing on the quality of life outcomes a scheme’s design might produce. That means, health and wellbeing, civic engagement, education and employment opportunities, social connections, access to housing/energy/clean water and so on. By focusing on quality of life for everyone we will hopefully be making progress to a more inclusive, equitable and just society. The human factor With these four rules in mind, and with a social value framework to help shape projects at the earliest stages, we can arrive at schemes that work for everyone. This has never been more important, now that our cities and towns are struggling to maintain social cohesion in the face of economic headwinds like automation, post-Covid employment practices, a cost-of-living crisis, budgetary constraints and ageing populations. By focusing on social value through the lens of quality of life we can keep the dream of urbanism alive and thriving. Embracing its ethos will lead to a stronger foundation for our communities, society, economies and ecology.

5,How can lighting make our cities more inclusive?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-can-lighting-make-our-cities-more-inclusive,,"Our physical abilities, appearance, and past experiences can affect how we move around a city. It influences whether we avoid a certain part of the city, feel comfortable using social amenities like public transport or even leave the house after dark. Unfortunately, not all city designs provide equal access to encourage full, multi-modal participation in hours of darkness. Being marginalised in society, whether through gender, ethnicity, class, age, sexuality, or ability, can limit and hinder one’s ability to feel safe and comfortably navigate public spaces at night. A lively setting in a town square to one person can be daunting and exclusionary to another. The latest OECD Better Life Index found that a third of people do not feel safe when walking alone at night, while half of all female-identifying people do not. While this experience is universal and well known, there has not been a formalised way to address these lived experiences within the design process for cities. Systemic issues that significantly contribute to understanding public spaces, such as harassment, assault, and unease from state-sanctioned surveillance, often go unreported. This has flow on effects on the true value of using official crime statistics for designers to understand whether a space is truly safe or not, let alone come up with designs to address how safe it feels. Night-time lighting has the power to transform spatial equity. Providing the appropriate atmospheres from light and increased visibility in public spaces facilitates more crowds and regular use of the space. It also encourages engaged users who are more willing to care for the space and the people around it, fostering a naturally safer community. This process starts with listening to the voices and needs of the community. Night-time lighting has the power to transform spatial equity. Contending with lighting standards The experiences of safety and comfort in urban spaces are affected by many psychological, social and environmental layers. At night, the presence of electric light ties all these layers together through the provision of sight. In creating spaces for everyone to enjoy and feel safe, the consideration and design of how we experience the night are just as important as designing for the daytime. Too often, designing for the night-time experience is reduced to a simple on/off approach with little consideration to the different people, activities, materiality, built forms and connecting pathways through and around the space. While we spend 50% of our time in darkness, lighting standards rarely address or consider how technical specifications of lighting interact with the urban environment to create atmospheres of fear and comfort for the people who use the space. Instead, traditional lighting standards focus only on numbers – the evenness (uniformity) and intensity (lux) of light landing on the ground. Our research has found that understanding local marginalised groups’ needs through a holistic lens of the wider urban context is crucial in developing inherently inclusive urban spaces. If not appropriately considered, this can significantly impact people’s mobility habits and feelings of personal amenity – compounding economic and social impacts for communities. The time is now for us to contend with and challenge the current design methods for the built environment. Our design decisions can facilitate the change that we seek to see in social attitudes, which can often take decades, if not longer, to shift. To create truly inclusive night-time environments, the design of our cities needs to start from a 24 hour and context-based response founded on listening to the lived experiences and needs of everyone in the local community. We hosted a night-time walk through Melbourne's city streets to workshop lighting design principles to see the impact on feeling comfortable in dark spaces. Case study: a new lighting narrative for women and girls  In 2018, we embarked on a research project with XYX Lab at Monash University to understand how technical expertise can change designs to address the negative experiences of the city from women and girls in Melbourne, Australia. We leveraged crowdsourced data from the Free to Be campaign based on over 900 safe and unsafe night-time experiences from women and girls in Melbourne, which found lighting to be the most important built environment factor in creating perceptions of safety at night. This crowdsourced data has allowed us to investigate the technical requirements for lighting to facilitate perceptions of safety in cities, fundamentally changing how we practice urban lighting design – moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach to lighting our streets. As a result, we have developed a unique methodology – the Night-time Vulnerability Assessment (NVA) – which we embed at the beginning of our urban design processes to address night-time spatial inequity. The NVA is an evidence-based methodology leveraging analytics to measure and diagnose the social, physical and atmospheric qualities that work together to affect perceptions of safety and design for positive experiences after dark. Developed in collaboration with our Risk, Security & Resilience, and Urban Design colleagues, the NVA formalises a quantification of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), and weaves in the Prospect and Refuge, and Broken Windows Theories alongside best practice urban lighting principles. The methodology inherently involves marginalised voices at the beginning of the design process, bringing together qualitative and quantitative datasets to holistically understand the environmental, economic, and social aspects of a space. We embed the Night-time Vulnerability Assessment (NVA) at the beginning of our urban design processes to address night-time spatial inequity. Applying the NVA to an external urban project allows us to diagnose site-specific, technical design requirements to implement impactful design outcomes to address social inclusivity in night-time environments. We then validate these issues through direct engagement with the local community in night-time workshops that create awareness and empower to bring about positive social change. The outcome of the NVA process provides asset owners and operators with a holistic overview of the practical and technical lighting infrastructure and design requirements to prioritise when developing a future proof night-time strategy or masterplan.

6,Science is Not Enough. We Also Need Imagination.,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/science-is-not-enough-we-also-need-imagination,,"Isaac Asimov, the late American science fiction writer, left us, among many things, with this thought-provoking quote: “The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” There are a number of truths to this. The first is that science has empowered us with an ever deeper and broader understanding of the world around us. We are living in an Internet and science-fuelled “age of enlightenment” where almost everything can be known with the touch of a button. The second is that it is still incredibly difficult for individuals and organisations to make effective use of this knowledge. Incomplete access to knowledge, competing priorities and a lack of integrated thinking often make it impossible to translate all the scientific evidence we have into actionable insights for decision making. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing this in some domains, but they still only reach areas where data is plentiful, accessible and useable. What does this new “age of enlightenment” mean in the context of cities? From my experience, Asimov’s view also applies to current thinking in urban design, planning and policy. When it comes to designing urban spaces, there is so much we could and should know, but fail to make structured sense of. Our discipline often rushes into projects, without first taking a step back and trying to understand the wider context. Imagine being asked to design a new district in a large city. You start to gather all the evidence to make choices on the provision of transport, the size and typologies of spaces, civil engineering requirements, public services, etc. Before you know it, you find yourself overwhelmed—a modern district must now be age-friendly, carbon neutral, climate resilient, designed using circular principles, and so forth. It is often simply impossible for asset owners/ operators, individuals, or project teams to adequately take account of all these priorities and integrate them in a structured and meaningful way. To address this complexity, urban design professionals tend to allocate responsibility to siloed experts with distinct specialisms and miss out on the opportunity for a truly integrated and holistic approach. As Asimov argues, a lack of information and evidence is no longer the problem. Rather, it is that we often fail to integrate evidence into a coherent picture and a common vision when working on urban design. More information does not equate to better decisions. The idea is to start big, think holistically and slowly zoom into priorities right from the start of a project. This approach helps to set better foundations from which everything else can grow and ensures that we look into the future whenever we can. The other key ingredient urban design professionals often overlook is the forward view: a look into the future, where we ask ourselves how the world could be different, and what this would mean for our design and decision making today. So how can we address this challenge? We need to recognise the complexity and systemic nature of everything we do. It does not matter if you are designing a single building or an entire city: all projects exist within a complex ecosystem, and this ecosystem is subject to constant change. What does this mean in practice? I like to use the simple “STEEP framework” that captures the Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental and Political factors driving change within a “system”. Teams can do this at the start of every project to help identify priorities and set a common vision. For example, if you were designing a new district in Singapore, you could use the STEEP framework while considering issues such as the following: Social: an ageing population, shifting household patterns Technological: energy system transformation, expansion of robotic and autonomous systems Economic: future growth industries, scaling up to a circular economy Environmental: impact of climate change, biodiversity loss Political: changing environmental policy, housing strategy. Our discipline often rushes into projects, without first taking a step back and trying to understand the wider context. It is important to identify and discuss these factors with the whole project team, bringing together all stakeholders as part of a single future-focused process and dialogue. This approach immediately brings about a much more diverse and holistic view of everything that matters to a project. It also enables an early conversation on outcomes. What do we really want to achieve in terms of positive social, economic and environmental effects in the future? How do different disciplines work together to maximise benefits? We build bridges across disciplines, generate clarity on priorities and start to generate a common vision of what we are trying to achieve. Analysis of the system, factors and trends driving change can then be supplemented with scientific evidence and the best available knowledge. Collectively, this is utilised to inform the priorities for a future programme, architectural brief, or wider masterplan. The idea is to start big, think holistically and slowly zoom into priorities right from the start of a project. This approach helps to set better foundations from which everything else can grow and ensures that we look into the future whenever we can. Starting with imagination and setting a strong and ambitious vision allows us to contextualise change, understand future trends, align all relevant project stakeholders and ultimately make better decisions today. It is our attempt to bring together the best of our scientific knowledge and apply it with wisdom.

Walking policy, plans and delivery should be designed to help reduce the health, economic and societal inequities many people encounter throughout their lives. However, a lack of data often exists on who is walking or wheeling. In addition, for many people walking and wheeling is not a choice but a necessity. We need to improve safety, accessibility, and comfort, as opposed to just focusing on walking and wheeling participation. In collaboration with Sustrans and Living Streets, this guidance aims to help make walking and wheeling attractive and accessible to everyone. Using an intersectional approach, we consider the experiences of eight groups and how the barriers they encounter may be shared or compounded between groups. Our recommendations seek to make walking and wheeling more inclusive for everyone, acknowledging that some people face greater disadvantage and require tailored support. Walking for Everyone sets out an ambitious and inclusive agenda for the future of walking and wheeling across diverse communities.

8,Relighting and rewilding our environment ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/relighting-and-rewilding-our-environment,,"In the global sweep of urbanisation over the last 150 years, the presence of reliable public lighting has been a brilliantly visible sign of human society’s mastery of its environment. Not for nothing do commentators comparing the relative developmental fortunes of North and South Korea usually display aerial photos, a blaze of light in the South, continuous darkness in the North. However, in the last twenty years, concern has been rising about the secondary and negative effects of our ability to relentlessly light the environment we share. We have begun to grasp that ‘light pollution’ has wider and more significant impacts on the natural world and is beginning to undermine our other goals. With understandable calls to protect precious biodiversity and even initiatives to ‘re-wild’ areas where human development has upset the balance between humans and nature, lighting is beginning to be recognised as a key factor deserving a reappraisal. Brightness grows Light pollution is reckoned to be growing at about 2% per year across the developing world. Increasing light pollution produces change in ways analogous to climate change, causing fundamental damage to flora, fauna and ecosystems. Under increased levels of artificial light, night-time pollinators are 62% less likely to visit flowers (moths specifically), marine animals such as sea turtles struggle to breed and birds’ migratory patterns are disrupted. Artificial lighting’s pernicious effects on animal development and population levels brings the issue into conflict with emerging regulatory requirements that new developments must protect and promote biodiversity. Light is no longer an issue that can be ignored and from France and Germany, to Australia and New Zealand, environmental regulators are starting to respond, gaining insights from activists and scientists, and drawing conclusions. Take the French government’s 2018 decree on light pollution, which looks to regulate “excessive disturbance to persons, fauna, flora or ecosystems, causing energy wastage or preventing observation of the night sky.” The decree sets an impressively comprehensive definition of acceptable levels of artificial lighting across the urban and natural environment. Perhaps more importantly, it’s a clear indication of how regulation can be applied in a thoughtful and effective manner, setting standards for other nations to emulate. As ever, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide further stimulus to action on the issue. Light pollution falls squarely under the SDGs 14 and 15 with their focus on the protection of ecosystems on land and in the water. A solvable problem Unlike climate change issues, light pollution is relatively easy to minimise, as if by ‘a flick of a switch’. The causes are all within our control and once we recognise the problem, it’s possible to take a more measured and thoughtful approach to the artificial lighting of our world. We can find a workable way of championing ecology and protecting biodiversity while providing comfortable urban lighting and feeling of safety at night. Furthermore, efforts on this issue will also reduce energy use, lower the harmful effects of light pollution on human health and promote our connection with the natural world. So, how do we achieve this new balance? The short answer is that we need to take a more nuanced and inclusive initial approach to the way lighting is designed into development schemes, where a range of natural and environmental considerations shape the specification from the very start. 1 of 2 In Sydney a staircase integrates lighting at a low level and within paths, providing functional use but not overlighting Rule one: let the night happen One of the most direct impacts on nature is that continuous urban lighting effectively undermines the differentiation between day and night. The design fix for this is to build greater control and flexibility into the way urban lighting is operated, seen in the Kemeralti Masterplan. Clearly we need to balance the need for public safety with the existing overuse of lighting according to a fixed schedule. We could easily decide to become more forensic about how lighting is implemented. In more social areas of a town or city, you might opt to make sure Friday night lighting operates later, but not in the rest of the week. The ultimate goal is to change cultural perceptions of lighting, encouraging a more critical approach in the general population. Actually, we can see how this can take hold. A 2021 study showed that 95% of Parisians polled felt that the city centre was over-lit. A French parkour group has even made turning off urban lighting part of its nightly activities. Perhaps a hunger for change is building. Rule two: carry out a truly holistic assessment Initial assessments should align architecture, lighting design with biodiversity analysis, such as the road lighting at Centrale As. Every location’s ecology is particular and different and those needs must be understood. The central change in thinking here is that we don’t need to see urban development and championing biodiversity as being essentially in conflict. The growing interest in ‘rewilding’ initiatives have set in motion a reassessment of the impacts of urbanisation on the natural world. Commitments to biodiversity net gain will mean encouraging nature to flourish in new places too, something we won’t achieve if artificial light is allowed to disrupt natural rhythms for plants and animals. A more enlightened approach to lighting fits within this same narrative of finding new harmony between human development efforts and protecting the natural world. Making it happen As ever, the challenge is to somehow change norms from within our industry and establish a new definition of what good urban lighting is – it means establishing a new ethos, one that’s shared by the public, commercial operators, suppliers and regulators alike. Incentives do exist, and we believe that the approach offers reputational rewards to organisations that proudly embrace it, helping to build an organisation’s ethical bottom line. As we discussed at the start, regulators are beginning to have lighting in their sights. Here in the UK the government has recently debated updates to the Environmental Bill, looking at potential light pollution reduction targets. An All Party Parliamentary Group has formed to investigate the issue further. With biodiversity net gain increasingly a legal requirement on major schemes, it feels inevitable that light pollution will soon be in the spotlight.

9,The laboratory on your street: how science can bring discovery back to our cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-laboratory-on-your-street-how-science-can-bring-discovery-back-to-our-cities,,"When we picture typical laboratories or research facilities, the image tends to be of large, pristine white buildings set in rolling hills, or dedicated ‘knowledge parks’, usually located some distance from a town, near a handy motorway exit. But a range of converging trends are beginning to challenge this practice, bringing a new generation of scientific buildings right into the heart of our towns and cities. It’s a slightly surprising story of creative post-pandemic repurposing, of considerable commercial opportunity and a way to drive effective recruitment. As a 2021 Urban Land Institute report on the life sciences property market makes clear, location is an increasingly key factor for scientific businesses and organisations. A new generation of researchers and scientists have emerged, who wish to live the same urban lives as their peers, meaning the era of the out of town science park is dwindling in appeal. Tech firms have been wrestling with this same challenge, perhaps for longer, leading to vibrant tech clusters in city centre locations, like London’s King’s Cross Knowledge Quarter (dominated by Google’s new HQ) or Berlin’s Silicon Allee. Inspiration starts with environment The theory is that these new hubs of highly skilled, highly motivated and collaborative people, make sense located near investors, social opportunities, access to government and that the city itself adds prestige and brand value. What is true here of ‘tech’, is equally true of the science sector. Arup contributed to the Francis Crick Institute, which opened in 2016 and which has led to a host of science companies located around its campus in the Kings Cross Knowledge Quarter. Universities and research institutions are now increasingly looking to urban locations to accommodate and attract global talent. Scientists and researchers are looking for roles in more central locations with access to amenities, travel links and affordable accommodation. So, how can science sector bodies embrace this new urbanism? So if we know the idea will attract talent, ensure a growing and thriving community of experts, isn’t the main barrier – urban development costs – still in the way? While it’s true that the land under most major cities is a country’s most expensive, other recent trends present an opportunity. With bricks and mortar retailers retreating from town and city centres, out-competed by ecommerce giants, and the post-pandemic phase encouraging developers and landlords to think creatively about how their estates might be used in future, there is an opening for new uses and new ideas. Retrofit – reuse that drives sustainability Retrofitting existing buildings is becoming more physically viable and commercially attractive. It addresses the embodied carbon issues inherent in building new, and is a way for organisations to ‘walk the walk’ on their wider climate commitments. In the UK, all buildings must be net zero carbon by 2050 and at the same time it is estimated by the UK Green Buildings Council that 80% of 2050’s building stock already exists. That means meeting embodied carbon targets through repurposing buildings wherever we can. While not every building will be suitable for repurposing to scientific or laboratory uses, those that are (and which are located close to an existing life science or academic research hub) should be considered for conversion for science. Conversion in practice Bringing science into the existing fabric of a city presents challenges, but not insurmountable ones. It’s a puzzle that involves overcoming technical, engineering and planning constraints, backed by insights into life science trends. Successful retrofit assessments require resolution of issues within a dedicated multidisciplinary framework. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Evaluation and assessment The process begins with an evaluation of the likely tenant profile, including the number of people that will use the facility, the division between offices and laboratories and a potential mix of laboratory types (wet, dry, digital) on a typical floor. Historically, the laboratory sector has used an informal set of criteria for design, including elements like typical air change rate, additional services and split between office and laboratory spaces. We are currently exploring ways to carry out classification of the different levels of possible facility for different tenancy types (small, medium or large). Define operations in practice Operating a life science facility is completely different from operating an office. There is an additional requirement for specific deliveries (gasses, cryogenics, etc.), waste removal and associated delivery routes throughout the building. The requirement for external delivery access point and a goods / dedicate lift is critical to safe operations. Early identification of the limits of an office to pass this type of inspection will be a crucial consideration to enable the repurposing of a structure. Design and implement relevant building services Space for services is often one of the most challenging aspects of repurposing an office into a science facility. Higher air change rates give rise to an increased demand on the heating and cooling systems. Specific laboratory services including fume hood extract systems and gas storage might result in previously lettable space being given over to plant and equipment. While shopping centres and retail units benefit from additional space to accommodate these services, it may prove more challenging for traditional office environments.

Specific laboratory services including fume hood extract systems and gas storage might result in previously lettable space being given over to plant and equipment. While shopping centres and retail units benefit from additional space to accommodate these services, it may prove more challenging for traditional office environments. Sites ripe for change Many developed cities are discovering traditional real estate assumptions no longer hold true, from the waning popularity of large mid-price hotels in the era of AirBnB to the continuing troubles facing major retail chains. For those looking at science conversion opportunities, shopping centres and retail units often look the most promising, whereas offices can prove more challenging but still have great potential. In reality, different solutions can be applied even within the most challenging constraints, and these solutions are closely related to the type and size of tenants and level of service provision that is targeted for a specific building. There are of course a huge range of structural factors to consider, and understanding building performance will be another crucial aspect to enabling a building’s use for science work. The vibration performance of the existing structure may need enhancing for specific operations and previously installed systems are unlikely to withstand the performance demands that life sciences impose to guarantee safety, quality and operability. Validating the performance of the structure and installed services is key to inform suitability for science conversion, to address ongoing issues and reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. An integrated design will need to be worked out – there are no off-the-shelf solutions for this challenge. A place for new ideas If you look with fresh eyes, you’ll see the signs of endless building conversion in almost every street of your city – churches become housing, pubs become offices, public conveniences become trendy bars – cities are always a petri-dish for new building uses and new ideas. So with a renewed love for city life evident in so many countries, and with a growing commitment to reuse as much of our already-built environment as we can, it’s an exciting time to bring science back into the city.

10,What if the client was everyone? How social value can transform urban development,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/what-if-the-client-was-everyone-how-social-value-can-transform-urban-development,,"As we walk around our cities, we often pass building sites with bright, breezy hoardings, announcing a new development, a mix of residential, retail, offices or restaurants. We often see these new developments as symbols of growth and progress, and more often than not we overlook the more complex implications they might have for the communities and neighbourhoods that surround them. Fortunately, urban development in the UK has begun taking a more systematic approach to the social value dimensions of new schemes, a change being driven by a combination of factors. The Social Value Act of 2012, and later the UK Government’s Procurement Policy Note in 2020 (PPN06/20), have redefined what contractors and developers must consider, include and produce. With other global issues like inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, pandemic recovery, the switch to net zero development, and the enduring need to tackle growing wealth inequality, there has never been a more important time to focus on social value. Learning by trying In reality, social value isn’t some intangible new agenda for the built environment industry to consider, just a more joined up way of approaching dimensions of their work they were always shaping (for good or ill). To prioritise social value in scheme design and planning is simply a recognition that a place is always its people and that they all have a stake and a voice. While legislation and procurement policies have started to include social value considerations into development, there is a danger that we focus on responding to the procurement questions in front of us and not on the people and communities that the development will ultimately impact. At Arup we have been reflecting on what we think social value really means, looking beyond procurement implications. The pandemic has provided many useful insights. The sudden rediscovery of localism, of our reliance on our neighbours, green spaces and public conversations underscore the attention we should pay to the inherently interconnected nature of individuals’ lives, the communities they form, the services they use, the employment opportunities they gain, and the infrastructure that makes it all possible. In short, we should never ‘build in isolation’. Our own projects have shown us how important the voice of the community can be. Sometimes the assumptions both we and our clients make about the local benefits of a scheme, will miss the mark. When we listen more closely to members of that community, they tell us something different. In a given setting, the inclusion of balconies facing each other facilitating neighbourly chats to combat loneliness can be more important than delivering STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workshops at a local school. In another setting, offers of apprenticeships for future construction jobs to a community with low levels skills and employment, remain vacant because they’d actually prefer access to apprenticeships with high tech firms around the corner. And ideas like bringing in new local restaurants and cafes can actually have a negative overall impact on a neighbourhood, if they don’t also cater to local cultures, tastes and incomes. These examples make clear how the process must be community-led. If social value outcomes are to genuinely be achieved, we must ask the right questions of the right people at the right time. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Social value means… a focus on people’s quality of life. That means health and wellbeing, education, opportunity, housing, social connections, civic engagement, and other beneficial outcomes that a scheme might support or produce. Shaping social value thinking So, how do we stay focused on what matters? How do we avoid one-size-doesn’t-fit-anyone initiatives? At Arup, we believe there are a few obvious guiding principles: 1. End short-termism Much of what has traditionally undermined social value in development is a lack of endurance to initiatives, leading to a kind of tokenism. We won’t have achieved genuine social value by offering a few short-term construction jobs for local people during a scheme’s development. A better approach, for example, would be for a project team to set up a new local contractor, one that could find other projects for its employees when the current one completes. Another idea is to develop a long-term social value agreement with the community and build it into the lease, to ensure that the community has a voice long after the development is complete. A community land trust – such as The Knowle West Media Centre project called ‘We Can Make’ – can be established to set up a Community Design Code to ensure the design and planning of housing is in line with community requirements, but also so that the new housing gets transferred to community ownership for long-term community oversight and management. The crucial distinction is to view the project as a powerful social lever, not just an opportunity for charitable gestures. Procurement practices and regeneration plans can help set new standards here; cities, local authorities, governments, and the private sector have the ability to push for longer term outcomes in their specifications. For example, the city of Boston has created a Community Benefits Agreement with a developer, as part of the extension of Boston’s light rail and associated real estate development. This enabled them to include agreements on affordable housing, local jobs, workers’ rights, small business initiatives, community resources, open space, arts and culture, public safety, and participatory planning in the redevelopment. It shows how ambitious we could and should be. 2. Move from box ticking ‘engagement’ to genuine co-creation Traditionally, most projects carry out some stakeholder engagement, before moving into the design and development phase, then follow-up with a final check-in, late in the programme. A more socially valuable approach would be to ask the community what they actually need and would like to see. It also means bringing community leaders into the governance structure of a scheme, to ensure their voices aren’t lost as the project progresses. A number of cities – starting with Belo Horizonte in Brazil and then Mexico City and New York – have embraced this kind of approach through participatory budgeting, enabling more deprived communities to have a say in where and how city budgets are spent. This type of approach might sound a fanciful leap for commercial developers to take, but there are benefits to an enlightened approach. Bringing the community onside more fundamentally and continuously lowers the level of objections and planning headaches for developers. It’s a process that builds local understanding and engagement within the community, strengthening social resilience as a result. For developers, reputational gains are huge when projects succeed in a more enlightened way. 3. Social value can't be an offset To count as ‘socially valuable’, it’s not enough for developers to engage in divisive designs, while offering disconnected financial remedies or investments to compensate for a lack of social value inherent within the design itself. The focus on social value must lead to solutions that recognise the existing fabric of the community, not drive further isolation and separation, and ensures that social value is intrinsic to the project itself. For example, adding in social housing to secure planning approval, but failing to consider and collaborate on how to integrate the social housing with the privately owned properties, misses the real opportunity to foster and deepen a shared sense of community. 4. Focus on quality of life If social value is all about real improvements in real lives, planners and developers must work with communities to understand the relevant quality of life issues impacting people. At Arup, we think social value is really just a way of focusing on the quality of life outcomes a scheme’s design might produce. That means, health and wellbeing, civic engagement, education and employment opportunities, social connections, access to housing/energy/clean water and so on. By focusing on quality of life for everyone we will hopefully be making progress to a more inclusive, equitable and just society. The human factor With these four rules in mind, and with a social value framework to help shape projects at the earliest stages, we can arrive at schemes that work for everyone. This has never been more important, now that our cities and towns are struggling to maintain social cohesion in the face of economic headwinds like automation, post-Covid employment practices, a cost-of-living crisis, budgetary constraints and ageing populations. By focusing on social value through the lens of quality of life we can keep the dream of urbanism alive and thriving. Embracing its ethos will lead to a stronger foundation for our communities, society, economies and ecology.

11,How recycling concrete could accelerate sustainable construction ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-recycling-concrete-could-accelerate-sustainable-construction,,"With the world’s population still growing, so continues the development of humans’ physical environment. As things stand we still rely on newly cast concrete as an efficient, strong and relatively low cost building material, emitting unsustainable amounts of CO2 as a result (reckoned to be 4 billion tonnes of cement annually, equating to 8% of global emissions). The process of demolition when an asset reaches its end of life mostly results in piles of rubble. The scale of waste here is significant. Cembureau, the European cement organisation, calculates that 450-500 million tonnes of construction waste is generated in Europe annually. In the USA, experts reckon concrete could be up to 85% of construction waste. Whatever the precise number, as long as the industry isn’t being forced to price in the externalities of climate change, it’s simply cheaper, quicker and easier to knock things down and start over. This rubble masks unseen costs. Concrete production is a one-way transaction with nature, producing valuable structural strength at considerable cost in CO2 emissions. Demolition amounts to a careless disposal of that investment, without accounting for the natural capital it has taken to produce. The era of reuse It’s clear that in a post-COP26 world, a convergence of global trends, new regulation, public demand and other market factors are going to force a reappraisal of long-held assumptions. And as designers and engineers of every kind of structure, we at Arup are increasingly concerned with finding a more sustainable way of producing the built environment. In recent years we’ve seen some truly ambitious and innovative reuse/adaptation projects to avoid demolition. LocHal, a former rail depot in Holland or Coal Drops Yard, once a derelict industrial site in London, both demonstrate how old structures can be imaginatively repurposed. But there are of course some constraints and limitations at play here, and not all structures can (or should) be conserved. The increasing deployment of circular economy principles where current building components are designed for future reuses is good to see, but this still nascent and it remains the case that only certain existing structures are likely to be adaptable to new uses. For many, demolition still looms. Don’t demolish, deconstruct! Perhaps the most obvious, yet largely unrealised option, is recycling concrete at the component level. We are getting better at doing this with steel and timber, so why not apply this familiar principle to concrete, the material where so many emissions are produced? This is where things get interesting. Obviously deconstructing a building, a kind of reverse construction process, is considerably more costly and time consuming than simply knocking it down with a massive metal ball. But viewed with a clear sense of urgency from the net zero goal that every organisation must now face up to, the incentives to adopt a new approach become quite persuasive. Broadly, they can be summarised as: Immediate CO2 savings. Every cubic metre of reused concrete can theoretically prevent a new cubic metre from being cast, saving over 250kg of carbon dioxide. We may never be able to reach this limit, but the difference between theoretical and realised reuse ratios will only close as digital fabrication methods become more capable, bringing more reused material back into the construction process. Greater stability. Reused concrete has the advantage of greater volume stability than brand new concrete, having endured creep and shrinkage when fitted within its original structure. Proven strengths. The inability to test concrete (before it is cast) means structures are built with onerous strength reduction factors that allow for material variability. With ‘stock’ components, the performance can be assurance tested, so this is another opportunity to improve on normal practice. Readiness for off-site construction. Governments and the industry are already advocating more offsite construction which, for concrete, means precast. Once more, reused concrete has an advantage, it just needs to be cut to the new shape as ready-made components before being delivered for assembly on site. Where do we start? As ever with major change, it can be hard to see where the revolution will begin. As it stands, reused concrete components aren’t top of architects or engineers’ minds, nor are clients or building owners demanding them. So how do we incentivise this change of mindset and practice, such that it scales and becomes a norm? My colleague Kristian Winther has written recently about how digital tools are beginning to embrace recycled material within their standardised view of components and structures, enabling a significant shift to more ‘circular economy’ principles. This would equally apply to concrete. Designers must be able to specify used components if the practice is to become normalised, accepted and widespread. The possibilities for reused concrete are also considerable. We don’t have to settle for the conservative idea that an old column must become a new column, as clearly plausible as that is. Our goal is to reduce the production of new virgin material as widely and quickly as possible, not to make like-for-like. That concrete column that was once holding up a banking headquarters could become a column, a pile, a series of building blocks, or unassuming kerb stones. A recent concrete footbridge in Fribourg, Switzerland by the EPFL’s Structural Exploration Lab has demonstrated how this idea could take off. Exemplar projects like this are incredibly valuable, helping to establish that the risks aren’t real, and that this is a resource whose value we’re simply ignoring. A rewarding idea In business, there’s an old adage about never wanting to leave ‘money on the table’. In our sector, I can see that ethos taking its own form, with building owners viewing the shell of their existing old structure as valuable, financially and reputationally. And who doesn’t want to make money or build a brand while doing the right thing? Our cities are rich with concrete, often in a condition as good if not better than the day it was cast. With just a small change in mindset among practitioners across the sector, from investors and developers to architects and engineers, can finally start to apply the ‘make once, use many’ ethos to concrete. Our commitment to net zero goals demands nothing less.

12,Climate change: More bold action needed to move needle after COP26,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/more-bold-action-needed-to-move-needle-after-cop26,,"The recent sharp pricing increase in EU carbon markets, with carbon soaring to almost 90 euro a tonne, up threefold from the start of last year, is a stark reminder of the long road ahead in the journey to net zero. Pricing of Europe’s Emission Trading Systems (ETS), which ensure polluters pay for carbon dioxide emissions, has risen as energy producers switch to cheaper coal amid a gas supply crunch. The mechanism, the world’s largest carbon market, is a key tool to combat climate change, and highlights the complexities many economies face in their bid to drastically cut CO2 emissions over the next three decades. Despite the celebratory tone at COP26, and some of the undeniable achievements including significant enhancements to nationally determined contributions (NDCs) from many developed economies, and the scaling down of fossil fuels and commitments to end deforestation; more bold action will be needed to move the needle in the fight to climate neutrality. Some 136 developed economies have announced significant enhancements to their national decarbonisation and resilience plans, including built environment emissions as part of their NDCs - which outlines a country’s climate plan in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. This will be work in progress in large trading blocs like the EU, charting a path forward under the stewardship of the EU Green Deal and the Fit for 55 policy package. But some of the world’s largest developing economies like China and Russia only slightly adjusted their targets. Indonesia – the largest economy in South Asia- did not modify them, and Brazil and Mexico slightly weakened theirs. Glasgow has kept the prospect of achieving 1.5°C alive by calling on governments to come back next year with Paris-aligned near-term targets. While COP26 commitments are a positive step in the decarbonisation journey, the scale of the job will require investments to be accelerated and clear pathways to reduce emissions gaps and deliver actionable progress. Climate: from commitment to impactful action Achieving these goals will require that both governments and the private sector establish comprehensive decarbonisation plans on a sector-by-sector basis, embedding resilience and sustainability risk pricing within business models. Follow through will be essential to make sure commitments are operational. As well as continuing to work with all the parties to achieve more progressive consensus in Sharm El-Sheikh, focus must zero in on how to translate pledges into near term plans and enhance transparency through better tracking of progress and impact. Country targets are nationally determined and there is currently no process for guiding a country’s adequate or fair contribution, and no wider negotiation of targets. Beyond the public sector, there is a swell of finance houses, industry, environmental NGOs and civil society all strengthening their calls for climate and sustainability leadership. More than 450 firms from across 45 countries have come together through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, with the commitment to set robust, near-term science-based targets to halve their fair share of emissions by 2030. EU: boldly moving forward In Europe, financial markets are already pricing sustainability risk and divesting carbon assets. Under the EU’s ETS, carbon prices are soaring in response, pricing the current spike in demand for coal amid an ongoing supply crunch and the future market direction. More opportunities will arise as these markets connect internationally as the Article 6 accounting frameworks are delivered. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement establishes a voluntary framework for countries to cooperate and enhance the transparency and accountability of carbon trading. Overall industry is aligned with where the markets are going, investing in mitigating aspects and embracing the public transparency and disclosure under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). But to allow this great ‘reallocation’ to blossom, EU policymakers must be bolder and create an enabling environment that encourages a greater flow of investment into mitigation and adaptation action. More financial flows into sustainable R&D and greater regulatory clarity and policy intervention can help the development of exemplary, bankable projects that deliver the right rate of return. The Fit for 55 package specifically targets the EU’s legally binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. This will be the legislative response to the bloc’s Climate Law, which entered into force in July 2021 to embed the EU Green Deal climate neutrality goals into law. It will address the EU’s current policy gap and provide a blueprint to achieve the 2030 goals through 13 policy proposals including pricing, targets and standards.

13,After the green light: building capacity to level up ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/after-the-green-light-building-capacity-to-level-up,,"The eagerly anticipated White Paper setting out the UK Government’s plans to address regional inequalities and to ‘level up opportunity’ is now due later this month. In advance of its publication, we are sharing our perspective that to be effective, levelling up must be driven at a local level. However, local and city authorities need sufficient capacity to deliver the complex, transformational change required to tackle this issue in a meaningful and sustainable way. Building local capacity is a prerequisite for achieving the more equitable and prosperous society we all want to see. Addressing inequalities The UK has among the most extreme disparities in wealth and economic performance between regions of any developed country.1 These inequalities may have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Left behind by social, economic and technological change, people and places are disillusioned and the UK’s economic potential is being held back. From the Humber, the Thames Estuary, the East Midlands, Yorkshire and the West of England, we have worked with local authorities across the UK on the issues at the heart of levelling-up: on economic development, governance, regeneration and placemaking. Local issues, local answers Arup has been working on these issues for many decades – in the UK and across the world. Our experience suggests that ‘levelling up’ needs to be locally led, designed and driven. Our towns and cities need to be able to plan more strategically, developing a coherent and evidence-based vision and strategy for a place over longer time horizons. To do so, they need greater certainty around their long-term funding and decision-making powers – but they also need capacity: the skills and resources that will drive and deliver levelling up initiatives. Constrained capacity: the causes Our discussions with clients reveal that the causes of resource shortages in local authorities are multi-faceted and complex. In essence, though, they boil down to three core issues that, if not addressed, will hinder our ability to deliver meaningful change. 1. Staffing pressures: Local authorities have an average 30% less staff than in 2012.2 This depleted pool of talent required to deliver change – programme managers, regeneration officers, finance specialists, procurement teams – is occupied with immediate issues, from the ‘day job’ of delivering public services to responding to the pandemic. 2. Complex funding: The funding landscape for local authorities is complicated. Multiple sources are available, but they often have conflicting objectives, misaligned timescales and bespoke delivery requirements. Bidding for these funds is complex, involving numerous submissions pre- and post-award, all draining resource. The competitive nature of many funds acts as a block to knowledge and resource-sharing across authorities. 3. Restrictive spending requirements: Many funding sources are highly restrictive on how money is spent. Programmes are often focused exclusively on capital projects with short delivery timescales, leaving authorities without sufficient funding to cover the sizable management and delivery costs of these complex schemes, or to cover ongoing operational costs. Charting a way forward There are, however, practical and deliverable actions for addressing this challenge. We believe that local authorities, central government and businesses like ours all have a role to play. Local authorities New approaches to implementation: Councils everywhere should consider creating dedicated, strategically focused teams to lead on levelling up initiatives. In some places, it might make sense to make these ‘arms-length’, for example as development trusts or regeneration companies, so long as this works for the council. Doing this can facilitate access to secondees from businesses and to funding from third parties. In addition, they can provide more agile procurement routes and greater flexibility around sharing commercial risk to help speed up local delivery. Leveraged spending power: Local authorities know can have a positive impact disproportionate to their powers and resources by working with and through others. They should build broad-based coalitions for change across business, community organisations, and other public sector bodies, seeking to align their spending plans to support local delivery. They can use their procurement power to secure supplier commitments on investment in skills and apprenticeships, secondments and inclusion of local enterprises in supply chains. Pooled knowledge and resources: Collaboration with neighbouring authorities is an effective and efficient way to augment resources and knowledge – as recommended by the National Infrastructure Commission. On the Towns Fund, for example, officers from towns across the country have a network to share advice on handling the conditions of the fund, saving duplicated effort and freeing up resources. A clear and widely understood case for change across different projects in a place, along with a common framework for evaluation, will create efficiencies in developing business cases and monitoring the impact of investment. Central government A new integrated funding approach: Simplifying the number of funding pots, streamlining the application and award process and allowing funding to be spent on delivery and operations costs – as well as capital – will significantly reduce resource burdens for accessing and wisely spending cash on levelling up initiatives. Better data, better decisions: Rapid, evidence-based reviews of barriers to private sector investment, education, skills, and transport will help make new local policy and interventions more targeted and effective. Government can refine its approach to data collection and analysis across all of these areas – measuring the right things at the right scales – and use new data analytics to evaluate the impact of initiatives. This will help towns and cities better understand their needs and opportunities and prioritise efforts. Supporting the development of local leaders: A ‘Local Leaders Academy’ programme – like a large-scale version of the Homes England capacity centre – would supercharge excellence and knowledge sharing across local authorities and institutions. Our experience designing and running the Place Leadership Programme for the Towns Fund highlights the value of this exchange between independent experts and the participants themselves. Private sector Leadership: Businesses have a major role to play in relation to their commitment to maximising social value, deploying their time and skills to public sector causes can help address the challenges faced by local authorities – as clients and partners. It can also allow for knowledge transfer and skills sharing, as well as delivering meaningful change for communities. Local presence and skills: Businesses involved with levelling up related initiatives should lead from the front and think about where their people and offices are located – and the role they themselves might play in the process of promoting local opportunity and prosperity. Having a physical presence in the communities with which we work enables a much greater degree of local understanding, civic engagement and skills development. We have an office in Whitehaven with 75 high skilled jobs, where we are helping to link national industrial decarbonisation ambitions with local social value strategies to ensure the community is more prosperous and resilient in the future. Delivery partnerships: Traditional consultancy engagements rarely have sustained impact on local capacity once projects are completed and the consultants move on. Firms (and procuring authorities) should place greater focus on the legacy they leave behind in terms of skills and resources so that local authorities can build their own in-house capacity over time. Whatever the details contained in the White Paper, delivering the political, economic and social imperatives that inspired it will take imagination and commitment. Above all, local authorities must be in the driving seat so they can get on with delivering for their people and communities – and the change we all want to see.

Climate change and environmental restoration are top priority for countries and cities around the world. The damaging consequences of rising temperatures and the increased frequency of extreme weather events are impacting on social, economic and environmental systems. Cities account for 70% of global carbon emissions, 60% of resource use and produce 50% of global waste and in this context, they are a part of the problem. Cities, however, are also playing a key role in addressing the effects of climate change and can be a significant element of the solution, largely achieved through climate protection and adaptation measures to become net zero – but this transition is a complex and challenging one. Adopting circular economy principles – like designing for recycling and reuse, or adapting existing buildings and assets – could allow cities to accelerate decarbonisation, while also addressing longstanding issues like resilience and quality of life. Working with Enel, and the University of Genoa, Bocconi University and Universidad de Los Andes, Arup has created a report exploring these timely themes.

15,A city on two wheels: how to encourage inclusive active travel ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-city-on-two-wheels-how-to-encourage-inclusive-active-travel,,"For the last decade, it’s been clear that improving city transport can and should mean more than simply adding metro or bus capacity. As cities also grapple with the challenges of meeting net zero goals, the focus is increasingly on measures that will encourage both public transport and expand the popularity of ‘active travel’ – cycling, scooters, walking, jogging. In this way travel is an issue that addresses multiple priorities: health and wellbeing, economic opportunity, public safety, traffic congestion, air quality and social inclusion. With budgets always under pressure, the goal is to develop active travel programmes that are genuinely inclusive, for all age groups, genders, and that command real public support and engagement. How does active travel respond to a city’s historical transport decisions and priorities? Often the status quo includes wide congested roads, triple lane highways, a preference for cars and trucks and buses. In this scenario the public are often understandably hesitant to shift away from their cars, despite the traffic, citing safety, difficult routes or poorly lit pathways. As our recent work on an inclusive active travel plan for Ankara, Turkey demonstrates it’s not simply a case of building cycle paths and expecting people to leave their cars at home. While the initial pilot scheme extends to 4.75km, the longer-term ambition for this project in Ankara is to realise 210km of new cycle lanes – a major step forward, assuming cycling gains acceptance in the city. So, what principles guided our work? Listen and learn To produce real local interest in active travel options, particularly where this involves overcoming entrenched patterns of behaviour, you have to conduct local research and focus groups. A listening exercise will reveal both general and particular barriers to overcome. In our Ankara work, we discovered that the lack of physical barriers between cycles and other vehicles and pedestrians was seen as a major issue to overcome. This would go on to shape our thinking about how cycling could go from ‘unfamiliar/unsafe’ to ‘obvious choice’ in the shortest time. We also identified key motivators to weave into the overall narrative. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Craft messages for different user groups In the case of Ankara, we knew we were facing the city with the highest level of car ownership and usage in the entire country. It would not be enough to provide some cycle hire points and expect instant change. We realised that to ensure engagement with what is a new way to travel, we need to understand the consumer and their motivations, address their concerns, convince them, and correctly position our cycling proposition. It also means tailoring the message to different user groups. Children and young people can be encouraged to see cycling as something that improves their leisure and freedom. For adults and older groups, cycling can make more sense as a healthy choice and as a cheap, inclusive form of transport to work. Safety is the first story to tell In that communications strategy, the research with local people was clear on the reasons for scepticism or concern: the city in its current form didn’t seem at all safe for cyclists; there was a belief that you wouldn’t be able to go point-to-point by bike, without giving up or switching back to powered transport at some point. In the background of these concerns are Turkey’s road fatality rate, running at around three times that of the UK (2019 figures). To guarantee the safety of cyclists, we designed the cycle network to minimise interactions between cyclists and motorised traffic, especially on roads with higher speeds and traffic volumes. We also considered physical criteria to determine which streets have the potential to be cyclable; gradient, surfacing, speed, parking, street width. Significant sections of the local street network in Ankara can be considered inherently cyclable for all population groups of the city. These streets are characterised by narrow carriageways, low speeds, and the absence of through traffic. These cyclable streets will play a key role in building the cycling culture of Ankara and will act as feeders to the more formal infrastructure. Active travel is multi-modal Part of our approach to encouraging the adoption of cycling and active travel measures, was to make explicit their connection to other forms of public transport. Once users grasp how cycling or walking integrates with other affordable, regular and safe transport options, there’s greater possibility that they will make the switch. This is particularly important for older, more frail or disabled travellers, who need to have confidence they will be able to complete their journeys safely. A climate change roll for the public In poll after poll, the public are ahead of politicians in wanting to see urgent progress on net zero, decarbonisation and climate change. This indicates a clear opportunity to position active and inclusive travel programmes as a means by which the public can play their part in this local and global agenda. Related issues like air pollution, clearly caused in part by fossil fuel vehicle emissions, are more tangible to city populations than the more distant and complex idea of climate change. Everyone shares the same oxygen, so everyone can play their part in improving its quality by changing their travel behaviour. Keep selling the benefits Among the many negative impacts of the 2020-21 coronavirus pandemic has been the fall in use of public transport networks, often after years of vital investment and development. To prevent the spread of the disease, populations were encouraged not to use them, and in places that behaviour has stuck. While this will hopefully prove temporary as the vaccine rollouts continue to take effect, it’s a reminder that active travel programmes will require a continuous sales pitch to the public at large. Ultimately, we believe that active and inclusive travel has enough merits that it will begin to sell itself. Post-pandemic there has been a resurgence of interest in ideas like the 15-minute neighbourhood, where life, work and leisure coexist in a contained neighbourhood – a scale where active travel makes the most sense. For city authorities, it is these lifestyle improving elements that will be most valuable as they attempt to encourage this more sustainable model of travel across our cities.

Play is essential for children’s well-being and happiness, as well as for their healthy physical and emotional growth. The built environment is a critical play and learning resource for children: in cities, there is constant opportunity to realise the potential of playful learning experiences. The city scape invites and nurtures children’s innate curiosity during play, whilst providing the interactions necessary for children to practice the relational skills that enable our communities and society to be adaptable, sustainable and flourishing. But to date there has been limited guidance on how to design neighbourhoods that encourage play beyond playgrounds, and that consider all of the environments in which children spend their time, including public spaces.

Traffic congestion and pollution, poor air quality, flood resilience, urban heat, low green space per capita, and the effects of urban sprawl have come to challenge life in the capital. In a bold and forward-looking move, the Mayor of Tirana, Erion Veliaj, working with Stefano Boeri Architects, has put forward a new green, orbital forest as a solution to these issues. The forest - a proposed ring around the urban perimeter of the city with a mix of forests, shrubland, agricultural land and recreational areas – is a nature-based solution that is intended to put a brake on urban sprawl, reconnect the citizens with nature, clean the air, address urban heat effects, and is just one part of a wider plan for the city’s future. “ Greening our city is a clear priority. As recently as five years ago, Tirana had zero playgrounds. We examined unused spaces across the city, listening to parents, children, teachers, to understand what was needed and where. Today, we have 70 playgrounds. ” Anuela Ristani, Deputy Mayor, City of Tirana Making the case for a forest Arup is supporting Tirana to build both the economic and technical case for the Tirana Orbital Forest, bringing landscape architects, ecologists, climate change specialists and economists together to assess the whole value case for our clients: Tirana and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is considering a loan to support the project. Arup’s work includes quantifying the wider environmental and economic benefits that the forest will bring such as improved resilience to floods, human health benefits from improved air quality to increased local economic activity and tax revenues stimulated by the provision of new recreational facilities. The project is a follow-on investment from Tirana’s Green City Action Plan (GCAP), developed through the city’s participation in the EBRD Green Cities programme. Tirana was one of the first cities to join the programme, with Arup selected as the experts to help the city develop their GCAP. The GCAP identified the Orbital Forest as a critical investment for Tirana to address its challenges relating to climate resilience, mitigation, urban sprawl and access to green space. Arup has developed an approach for quantifying the Orbital Forest’s benefits at scale supported by machine-learning tools that help establish the feasibility and commercial viability of such major green infrastructure projects. Our Land Use Machine Learning tool can carry out detailed classifications of nature and land uses from satellite images. It is so powerful it can distinguish between a tree nursery and a forest. Digital tools like this are enabling us to make investments in nature more practical and credible to funders and clients alike. Planting the infrastructure Tirana Orbital Forest is an important milestone in the EBRD’s mission to support investments in nature-based solutions. The Bank recognises the economic benefits green infrastructure can have in comparison to traditional, grey interventions. As a part of EBRD Green Cities, and as acknowledgement of these benefits, the project will receive support from the Green Climate Fund’s concessional resources made available to Green Cities like Tirana. It’s a remarkable development, one that demonstrates how the EBRD supported GCAPs can translate into implementing green infrastructure at scale. Our work to date has been to assess the benefits of different forest options and scenarios the city could adopt. Our approach centres around four key principles: to protect existing landscapes, connect people and ecology to and through the Orbital Forest, restore degraded landscapes and habitats, and provide places for people. 1 of 2 The forest is a proposed ring around the urban perimeter of the city with a mix of forests, shrubland, agricultural land and recreational areas Prioritising nature-based solutions and ‘green infrastructure’ We believe that the Tirana Orbital Forest could be the poster project that makes the wider financial case for green infrastructure, bringing vital new funding and investment sources to this nature-based approach. This is important, because as the world attempts to develop climate change adaptation measures, it’s vital to avoid overreliance on traditional grey infrastructure for issues like flooding. Further, the emissions involved in building more physical barriers mean we would simply be compounding the problem of climate change. Nature-based solutions offer so many different benefits, from storm water mitigation, to improved air quality, promoting biodiversity, and reducing the urban heat island effect. Greenery has a powerfully positive effect on quality of life for people too and adds in this way to the resilience of a city and its people. As a project, Tirana Orbital Forest is still at an early, but exciting stage. We plan to shape the project’s future phases and are keen to share what we learn with other cities that are ready to embrace green infrastructure. “ Nature based solutions like the Tirana Orbital Forest are effective climate measures that address both global and local environmental challenges. We hope that this project can set an important precedent for EBRD and other financial institutions to demonstrate the economic incentives of such investments, and will spur further investment in this space. ” Dr. Nigel Jollands, co-lead of EBRD Green Cities Find out more Expertise Sustainable development advisory Sustainable development and the growing impact of climate change are now priorities for every kind of business.

21,The circular economy can decarbonise our cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-circular-economy-can-decarbonise-our-cities,,"With global deadlines looming, and given that the built environment is responsible for almost 50% of raw materials’ consumption, it’s becoming imperative that we shift to a re-use, recycle, remake ethos as rapidly as possible. These circular economy principles can help cities to meet emissions reduction targets and decarbonisation goals. Circular economy principles, pioneered by our partners and collaborators at Enel Energy and organisations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, represent a fundamental shift in productive, design and operational thinking. By designing for reuse and recycling we can radically reduce emissions, enabling asset owners and operators across every element of city life, to use resources more efficiently. A forthcoming report from Arup and Enel will explore how this much needed revolution can be kickstarted. Taking on decarbonisation By taking a new and less tolerant approach to waste, we don’t just have an opportunity to decarbonise the built environment, energy and transport networks – the circular economy can also drive other beneficial social and market outcomes. Circular principles underpin a more resilient city, in measures that simplify or localise supply chains, protecting populations from some of the risks of globalisation. In the urban context, implementing circular economy approach would represent a progressive shift that has considerable implications for urban factors like transport networks, energy systems and the wider built environment. Arup Chairman Alan Belfield commented on the scale of change this represents, speaking at Enel’s October 2021 Circular Cities event. “We’ve got to adapt and we need everybody to do this. Whether it’s developers, investors, architects, manufacturers, contractors, governments, regulators or consumers, no single group can lead the change alone.” Time for uncommon collaborations 	Transitioning to ‘circular cities’, where waste is almost totally unheard of, will require the forging of new links between organisations, developing collaborations that can drive new business models and generate profits delinked from wasteful practices. Data will play an increasing role too, underpinning materials passports, enabling easier and less costly reuse of materials. City administrators, as Alan Belfield points out, can also play a role – they have responsibility for thousands of buildings and can play an influential role in developing the ‘circular city’. 				 As part of Italy’s official pre-COP26 events, the Enel Group and Arup presented their report at a conference in Milan on “Circular cities: impacts on decarbonization and beyond.” It illustrates how cities can be redesigned based on circular economy principles in order to achieve global decarbonization targets while improving resilience and the quality of life.

22,How do we transition to a food system that supports both human and planetary health?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-do-we-transition-to-a-food-system-that-supports-both-human-and-planetary-health,,"In much of our work here at Arup, we explore how systems work, and if they don’t work well, how to improve or fix them. We’ve come to realise the central importance of the food system in delivering a sustainable future and as a sector we should apply our thinking to. In their 2019 report, the Eat-Lancet commission asked a stark question: will we be able to feed a future population of 10 billion people a healthy diet without destroying the planet? As they noted, “food is the single strongest lever to optimize human health and environmental sustainability on Earth. However, food is currently threatening both people and planet.” The environmental threat on your plate Scientists and policy makers now recognise that up to a third of global CO2 emissions are food related. If we’re honest, this shouldn’t be surprising. How else does a supermarket half a mile away from me here in London offer fresh mange touts from Kenya? Globalisation has brought us incredible choice all year round, but as a series of productive systems it has evolved unchecked, become resource intensive and unsustainable. Apart from fuelling global warming, food production also accounts for 70% of freshwater withdrawal and is a major factor behind biodiversity loss. The industry is, of course, aware of these issues. International bodies like the EU are committed to Green New Deal programmes and working on farm-to-fork policies aimed at reforming how farming operates, to reduce waste and make agriculture a key plank in protecting the environment. For producers and processors, the expectation of growing emissions regulation is also a given. So if everyone knows change must follow, the question remains: which systemic improvements are most effective and commercially viable? More broadly, the very centrality of food production and consumption to all human life actually gifts us an enormous opportunity: by transforming the way we farm, process and distribute our food we can accelerate along the path to a sustainable way of life within the means of our planet. A sustainable food sector will protect the planet’s biodiversity, sequester more CO2 than it emits, lower the risk of flooding, bring rural and urban communities closer together and stimulate a more equitable economy. So, how can we transform this system we depend on? Let’s see how a systems-thinking approach might tackle common issues in the food sector. Climate-positive food production A first step would be to move away from using the soil like dead substrate, with all the harmful effects of pesticides and artificial fertilizers, to a practice known as ‘regenerative farming’. This commits farmers to focusing on soil health, leaving the land improved by the agricultural process year on year. Companies like Nestlé – the world’s largest single food producer – have started to see the value of this approach, especially given that the vast majority of their greenhouse gas emissions are in the farming process itself. There is a huge prize here, a transformation of farming into a soil-focused system that improves biodiversity, manages the water system more effectively, reduces flooding, lowers pollution and above all sequesters carbon. This is how food could become climate positive. An end to waste? Staggeringly, a third of all food is wasted. In developing countries the level of waste is taking place post-harvest, usually thanks to lack of effective storage. In developed nations, the waste is consumer-led, part of a food production system that artificially maximises supply by relying on pesticides and fertiliser (from oil and phosphates), generating considerable emissions, only for us to throw the food away. We can and must eliminate waste from the food system, entirely. We need to revisit the creation/consumption relationship, the use of plastics and of sell by dates. This would take a new level of collaboration between farmers, processing companies, regional governments, waste managers, supermarkets and consumers – to produce new behaviours and productive practices that replace the concept of “waste” with the idea of resource and value creation. If food was viewed as core element of the urban infrastructure, if it could also work as an energy source with all organic waste used to generate new energy and fertiliser into the bargain. Think more holistically Our globalised, just-in-time supply chains are a marvel, but maximising supply and all year around availability comes at the cost of low sustainability. Here in the UK, many of our tomatoes are imported from Spain, from an area with far more sunshine but little water. This might make sense in carbon emission terms. But given a tomato is essentially 70% water, we are effectively importing water from a region that needs it, to one that doesn’t. It’s also removing nutrients from the soil of one country to another, with limited means of recycling them back to grow our food, and thus baking in reliance on non-renewable artificial fertiliser. This makes no sense and is not sustainable. The food sector has an opportunity here, to collaborate with another industry in transition: energy. Farmers and landowners could share land under regenerative land management with renewables generators like on-shore wind or solar. Organic waste could go to anaerobic digestion to generate biogas as well as fertiliser gaining additional income and producing climate positive food for local communities. New business models may become possible, meaning food has to travel far shorter distances, and nutrient cycles can be closed and making food a more integral part of the country’s infrastructure.

23,Designing for a climate-changed built environment,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/designing-for-a-climate-changed-built-environment,,"As the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) convenes this fall in Glasgow, delegates, attendees, and industry practitioners agree that attempts to prevent our global warming from reaching 1.5 degrees warmer than preindustrial levels are falling short. With rising temperatures fueling devastating weather events from fires to flooding, this year’s climate summit goals bring a progressively sharper focus to mitigating the worst effects of these events and adapting to our changing climate. With the continued climate crisis stretching ahead, Arup’s resilience experts are working to build up the resilience that our built environment needs now. Below, Associate Principal Vincent Lee, Americas Energy Business Leader Cole Roberts, Climate Change Risk and Resilience Engineer Jack Hogan, and Arup Fellow Melissa Burton share the tools and approaches that can help futureproof our climate-changed and changing world, in tandem with the best efforts of world leaders, and all of us, to ensure that the worst of climate change is mitigated. Future-focused stormwater solutions Vincent: With record-breaking rain this summer, climate change is already here, and stormwater resilience is a critical focus area across the US. Tennessee saw record rain this past summer with areas seeing 17 inches of rain in less than 24 hours. The Northeastern US had nearly five times wetter than average rainfall for July. Hurricane Ida was the worst natural disaster to strike New York City since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, where at least 45 people were killed, streets became streams, and thousands of inland homes were flooded. On September 1st, 3.15 inches of rain fell in Central Park in one hour, eclipsing the record of 1.94 inches set only days before on August 21st. Even portions of the hot and dry Death Valley desert in California saw record rain in July. In our cities, there is no single stormwater solution that will solve this climatic issue. Arup’s Design with Water approach integrates the water cycle with sustainable planning, design, and delivery to achieve wider benefits such as decarbonization, improved health and wellbeing, and biodiversity enhancements, among others. Bay Meadows in San Mateo, California In the Americas, we have applied this approach for New York City’s green infrastructure program, the Bradley Plaza Green Alley transformation in Los Angeles, the Bay Meadows redevelopment project in the California Bay Area, and the University of Pennsylvania Penn Park. Moreover, our regional experts on implementing green infrastructure in cities were a part of a global Arup team in developing the Shanghai urban drainage masterplan. When designing infrastructure and buildings for the long term, in many climate zones it is no longer reasonable to only look to weather statistics and storm return periods derived from historical weather records without taking account of projected climate change effects. Improved access to locally focused climate predictions can enable engineers and planners to ensure that buildings and infrastructure are designed to accommodate anticipated changes in climate. One tool we have used to deliver our Design with Water approach is WeatherShift™. Arup, in partnership with Integrated Environmental Solutions and Argos Analytics, developed this online, interactive, publicly accessible tool that generates predicted future climate weather data from climate simulations based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. It’s essential that our infrastructure designs account for the record-breaking stormwater statistics we’re seeing now, while paying keen attention to predicted data to futureproof our communities and critical infrastructure and protect our most vulnerable populations. Solar energy resilience in the face of disruption Cole: While there is a continued need to curb our planet’s rising climate by meeting the decarbonization goals established in the Paris Agreement, climate-change related hazards have created a distinct demand for improved energy resilience. Large-scale cities and small communities alike are better trying to gauge their energy needs and build up resilience in the face of wildfires, extreme weather, sea-level rise, and other disasters. Arup can help meet these dual demands by taking a whole-systems approach to renewable energy, storage, and critical facilities in our communities. Solar photovoltaics, when paired with efficient battery storage systems and implemented through smart grid technology, can both meet the demand for energy resilience during a disruptive event while advancing our decarbonization efforts through renewable energy storage and generation. In collaboration with our clients and partners, Arup designed the publicly available SolarResilient™ toolset, which provides recommendations for solar PV plus battery storage systems. Funded by a United States Department of Energy grant, the toolset estimates the necessary rating and physical size of grid-integrated PV and battery storage that would provide power for extended periods of large-scale grid power outage — for single facilities up to entire portfolios. From there, Arup’s consultants help cities and building owners understand that data and map out a holistic urban energy resilience strategy. Working with leading cities in California, Arup analyzed over 700 critical facilities in 26 cities, including the financial, economic, and technical assessment of battery and PV systems for a prioritized group of shelters and libraries, scored based on exposure to hazards, walkability, as well as their proximity to disadvantaged and low-income communities. Arup’s program showed that implementing a SolarResilient portfolio investment would safeguard 5-8% of city populations overnight and enable day use for roughly 25% of residents during a multi-day outage. Implementing solar photovoltaic energy generation plus storage across a multitude of buildings can simultaneously lower costs, safeguard lives including our most at risk groups, and advance our climate action goals. Flexible Adaptation Pathways Jack: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently reported that global mean sea level (GMSL) rise is likely to reach between 0.5 to 1 meter by 2100. Evidence in peer-reviewed publications also support a physically plausible GMSL rise exceeding 2.0m within the design life of contemporary infrastructure projects. The question for infrastructure planners and policymakers is whether we should resist, restore, or retreat. Deciding between these strategies represents the crux of sea level rise adaptation planning, which underpins our work on a wide range of coastal resilience projects. To tackle this problem, Arup’s approach is to face future climate change uncertainty head-on with dynamic or adaptive planning. The Flexible Adaption Pathways approach is a type of dynamic planning well-suited for the uncertainty of projected sea level rise. The Kapalama Canal in Honolulu, Hawaii For a recent project on the island of Oahu, our Risk and Resilience team formulated a demonstration of the Flexible Adaptation Pathways method for the State of Hawaii Office of Planning. In this effort, we developed several adaptation “pathways,” from tidal barriers to wetland restoration to retreat options, which Honolulu could then take into account on its journey to mitigate flooding and defend against sea level rise long-term. Future extreme heat was also addressed in this project and proved to be equally applicable within the Flexible Adaptation Pathways framework. In this approach, we illustrated how to identify “no regrets” or “low regrets” pathways, which are strategies that lead to the fewest number of dead ends when considering a long-term planning horizon and multiple climate change scenarios. Adaptation plans are tied to an evolving knowledge base, which includes changing development economics as well as updated sea level rise projections. With pathways mapped across various futures with evolving knowledge, this method creates tipping points for actions, telling decision-makers when key investments can be made with the fewest potential regrets. Ultimately, climate change adaptation is a dynamic process, not an outcome. When planning flood protection infrastructure in areas vulnerable to sea level rise, the dynamic Flexible Adaptation Pathways process has helped our work with city planners by identifying paths of least regret and avoiding undesirable lock-in decisions as we plan for an uncertain future. Asset resilience across scales Melissa: When I was in second grade, a tornado whipped through my hometown. My dad was home from work early having bought a new car that day and my sister and I had just finished our school day and were playing a board game in the front room of our house. My mom saw the tornado forming in the distance and shouted for all of us to run for cover. My house that day was spared, but many on my street were not. My elementary school was levelled. This is my personal story, but as we see changing weather patterns and increasing intensities of violent storms like hurricanes, thunder events, and winter storms, there are more and more people who have their own personal stories. Here in Ontario where I live, the impact of climate change on public infrastructure and private assets is of significant economic importance. Costly damage over the past decade due to extreme weather events has become common. Toronto, Ontario Though our approach may differ depending on the client, our role at Arup is focused on supporting our clients in achieving resilience for their assets. That may mean supporting a global financial institution in better understanding climate risk across their +3,000-asset portfolio. Or it may mean engaging with City clients to develop climate action plans and benchmarking for resilience dividends. Or our approach may include supporting public and private clients in adapting designs to enhance resilience against the next big storm. If a collective agreement is reached to take immediate and unprecedented action, the 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscores that it remains possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. With this critical summit for global climate action approaching, we have an opportunity to change the magnitude and reduce the multitude of future stories."
24,COP26: Taking action on our climate commitments,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cop26-taking-action-on-our-climate-commitments,,"Following the UN Climate Change Conference in 2015, climate actors across governing bodies, businesses, nonprofits, and research institutions came together to commit to a carbon-neutral world by 2050. Five years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, individuals, jurisdictions, and organizations of all scales have worked to begin the transformation necessary to check climate change and its worst impacts — but we have a long way to go to achieve our net-zero-carbon economy vision. As the COP26 summit commences, Arup Fellows Fiona Cousins and Erin McConahey and Arup Americas Director of Cities and Sustainable Real Estate Brian Swett together reflect on the role of the AEC industry in achieving net zero, the next practicable steps for climate action, and how we can ensure our carbon-neutral future is equitable and just. How has the AEC industry stepped up to deliver on the commitments made in the Paris Agreement toward a net-zero future? Brian: Since Paris, I think the AEC industry has shown that engineering is not going to be the barrier to decarbonizing the built environment. By and large, the technology is there or about to be there. The challenge lies in transforming our energy supply to be carbon neutral. Our success in decarbonizing the built environment is going to involve a whole lot of electrification of our existing building stock and infrastructure, and our transmission and distribution systems are not set up for that modification of the grid at an unprecedented scale. And green power may not be ready to supply that electricity in a cost-effective way fast enough to meet the demands of electrification. Erin: Our industry has been an early leader of the formalized codes and standards that emphasize decarbonization in earnest. Architecture 2030, ASHRAE, and the New Buildings Institute have each pushed both the research on and advocacy for new energy standards for practitioners to adopt. In the last three to four years, we’ve also seen a rise in embodied carbon awareness in the United States. In the past, we’ve been focused on energy efficiency, which is directly related to operational carbon. Now we’re paying attention to the other half of the carbon equation. Structural engineers, through platforms like SE2050, have come forward to own the effects and emissions of cement and the embodied carbon in our supply chains. Low-carbon concrete codes have already been adopted in some Bay Area counties in California and I expect other areas to follow. Advancing our climate action goals Cornell Tech Emma and Georgina Bloomberg Center A cutting-edge research facility as part of the regeneration of New York City's Roosevelt Island The Bloomberg Center builds on Cornell University’s tradition of being a forward-thinking technology institution. The client and design team both embraced the importance of creating a net-zero building that would serve as an exemplar for future development on the campus. 1 of 3 Charge4All Scaling curbside EV charging infrastructure using a digital enabled and equitable approach Over the span of a year, Arup reviewed the experiences that utility companies, municipalities, and agencies faced when deploying public curbside EV charging infrastructure and translated that experience into opportunities for faster, more cost-effective, and equitable deployment. Arup was then able to develop a geospatial site suitability software, Charge4AllTM, which will ultimately streamline the deployment of public charging points. 2 of 3 Carbon Free Boston Leveraging advanced energy modelling to help make Boston buildings carbon neutral by 2050 Buildings currently account for roughly 75% of Boston’s GHG emissions profile, making reductions in this sector critical to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The goal of Carbon Free Boston was to help the GRC identify practical, data-driven policies and pathways capable of achieving carbon neutrality by the deadline. 3 of 3 Advancing our climate action goals Cornell Tech Emma and Georgina Bloomberg Center A cutting-edge research facility as part of the regeneration of New York City's Roosevelt Island The Bloomberg Center builds on Cornell University’s tradition of being a forward-thinking technology institution.

The goal of Carbon Free Boston was to help the GRC identify practical, data-driven policies and pathways capable of achieving carbon neutrality by the deadline. 3 of 3 What does the next phase of climate action look like? Fiona: As we move to the next phase for the AEC industry, I think we are going to see three main changes. Firstly, as Erin says, there will be more emphasis on embodied carbon and the circular economy; secondly, we will see a shift to policy and legislation that mandates changes in existing buildings because that’s where most of the impact is, especially around electrification; and thirdly, we will see social and environmental justice become strong drivers of climate action. Brian: We’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of progressive policies at the state and local level. I think more and more people are realizing that the hope and optimism around incentive-based programs bump against the challenges of rollout and adoption. We’ve set commitments, jurisdictions have their interim deadlines, now the programs need to catch up. All the delivery actors, from large firms like Arup to small mom-and-pop HVAC shops, need to know that every time they’re replacing a piece of equipment, there's an opportunity for greater efficiency or electrification. We’re going to have to take fossil fuel-based technologies and equipment out of the distribution and replacement supply chain over time. As fossil fuel-free alternatives become available, we will have to steadily remove the availability of fossil fuel-based equipment that has no future in a decarbonized built environment. Another policy change I think we’re going to see over the next decade is moving away from measuring kilowatt-hours and instead measuring tons of carbon emissions. Traditionally, building codes regulated energy, and this became a proxy for measuring progress on emissions reduction. The reality is they’re sometimes in alignment, but not always. Now, we need to set buildings up for success from the get-go. We don’t have time for multiple conversions to electrification. Emissions have to be what we’re prioritizing now, and more and more buildings codes and regulatory policies are starting to get that. Erin: In California and a dozen other states, we are seeing property-assessed clean energy (PACE) loans for energy improvements, which could be expanded to cover electrification. The loan is attached to the mortgage and the property itself as opposed to the person who is applying for it, so the cost burden is spread out over time and from owner to owner. At least for smaller-scale, residential owners these loans could support quicker conversion without a huge cost hit. We do have a tendency when creating policies to pair one-time cash incentives that cover first costs with annualized penalties if you don’t convert. For residential properties, I think we need to look at broader tax and insurance structures to find ways to reduce the overall cost of ownership of your building if you’ve taken the first step on behalf of the common good to decarbonize your property. What hurdles arise as cities and other entities aim to shoulder the weight of building decarbonization? Brian: Cities and real estate players have been predominantly focused on the demand side of energy efficiency and electrification — how energy is being used. But cities and large-scale owners are going to have to use their market and political power on the supply side — ensuring that enough green electricity supply is available to meet their future energy demand. In speaking with our clients, their concerns aren’t necessarily in electrifying their buildings, but in being able to buy green power at scale and for a reasonable cost. That piece of the puzzle isn’t in place yet in many parts of the country. Fiona: We’ve heard a similar theme in New York. Real estate players are saying, “I’m happy to reduce my emissions by electrifying, but I don’t believe the electricity is going to be there.” If they electrify and there’s no green power available, that’s not helping anyone. At least in New York, plans to decarbonize the grid are robust and well-advanced, but it’s a still a concern we hear again and again. And different cities have different levers for change: some cities control their local utilities while others do not, which means that some cities are much more able to act on the supply side. Erin: A parallel issue can be found in the supply chain. I can tell you right now that there are not enough heat pumps produced in the United States to support this conversion. In order to have a wide-scale transformation of our supply chain, we need to make it beneficial to convert the technology being produced through the guarantee of bulk purchasing contracts from cities. With the guarantee of knowing where the supply chain is going over the next 15 years, there will be enough impetus within the supply chain’s organizations to make the change. If we don’t start having these conversations with the supply chain, we won’t have enough equipment to actually pull off a net-zero carbon future. Like Brian said, we have to take a system-wide point of view because changing any single element is insufficient. Alignment and collaboration across sectors is the only path forward. Brian: The federal government has been a productive actor in incentivizing technology improvements as both a large-scale purchaser and setter of energy standards. To do something similar from an emissions standpoint seems like a natural extension for the Biden Administration. If you set an emissions-performance standard for buildings, you can define what success looks like including at the equipment scale. Then, to compete for these large-scale government contracts, you have to comply with their progressive standards. It would create a marketplace for that investment, not only in the technology sector but in manufacturing as well. Advancing our climate action goals SolarResilient SolarResilient toolkit links resilience with decarbonization In California, natural and climate related hazards have created a demand for action to improve energy resilience. Cities, counties, and communities are now trying to better understand their resilience to risks like fires and earthquakes, identify their critical energy needs, and build up their capacity to weather disasters. To help meet this demand, Arup designed the SolarResilient toolset in collaboration with our clients and partners. SolarResilient provides recommendations for solar PV plus battery storage systems to simultaneously answer the need for energy resilience during a grid disruption while also decarbonizing the community by providing renewable energy storage and generation. 1 of 3 Santa Monica Microgrid Developing a multi-user microgrid to provide clean and reliable power to the City of Santa Monica Arup is the lead consultant to the City of Santa Monica in the development of the microgrid project, which will provide clean, reliable power to the City Yards municipal facility and potentially incorporate adjacent sites, including commercial development, transit use, and museums.

Bradley Plaza Green Alley 3 of 3 As designers in the built environment, how can we ensure the pathways to a net-zero future are equitable? Fiona: We have to first be aware of where the unevenness lies. For a while, it was “green bling.” Basically, you could be zero net carbon if you had enough money to get there. It was a way to establish your position in the market. Now, as renewables get integrated into the infrastructure grid, we’re getting to a place where everyone can benefit, not just those who can afford to install solar power at their buildings. It's also essential to establish why decarbonization is so critical for everyone. There are always competing priorities: Why are we focusing on changing the grid when people don’t have enough to eat? We have to lead with, and then maximize, the co-benefits of decarbonizing — air quality and safety considerations — otherwise our net-zero future won’t be equitable. Brian: Part of the solution is to make economic and racial justice a lens on 100% of our decarbonization and energy efficiency programs. For example, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) subsidizes those still using oil heat in the Northeast, because if you can’t pay for the oil truck to fill your tank, then you don’t have heat, which is untenable. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars on that program every year, often supporting the same households annually, but don’t ask ourselves if we should be converting them to cleaner natural gas or electric heat pumps. By doing so, we’d make progress from both a public health and emissions standpoint. Instead, we put Band-Aids on social justice issues without addressing the root cause or spending money wisely. As we’ve learned through our conversations about equity, justice, and the environment , engaging with our local communities directly is also critical for success. By partnering with community-based organizations, we can better understand what’s feasible and co-develop implementable solutions that address energy efficiency and decarbonization in conjunction with economic and racial justice. Erin: It’s important to bear in mind that changing our energy sourcing infrastructure is costly. Up until the point that we’re 100% renewable, operating with a free sun as opposed to costly fuel, we have to pay off the capital cost of that transition. That means that as we make this transition, we need to invest in our vulnerable communities. Electricity can’t be so costly that the elderly or those with low mobility can’t afford their air conditioning. And as Brian mentioned, the reverse is true in the winter. As demonstrated by the New York City Housing Authority’s 2021 Sustainability Agenda update, we have opportunities to embed equity in our sustainability commitments and funding options are available to enable balanced access. It’s up to us as designers, policymakers, and city leaders to address this investment interplay and meet our long-term adaptation goals."
25,A city for women (not just the 'default male'),https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-city-for-women-not-just-the-default-male,,"Most of us live in twentieth century cities, largely reflecting twentieth century ideas and beliefs. While the mayors, owners, and designers of our cities are increasingly diverse (although not diverse enough), the ideals to which they create the city are still patterned by twentieth century beliefs. Given that cities are an expression of those who designed and developed them, it is mostly the ‘default male’ gaze – and with it male needs – that have been hardwired into the spaces, services and systems that we occupy and experience today. Once you start looking, you find persistent inequalities are set into the very concrete of the physical world, embedded within its governance and increasingly amplified through digital overlays. Hidden within the design of the system, we see public transport fare structures often give preference to the traditional commuter, and disadvantage those making many consecutive journeys (referred to as trip-chaining). Today, as women are still disproportionately responsible for household and care responsibilities, they make a greater number of these journeys and therefore tend to pay higher prices. Despite their ubiquity, digital technologies aren’t inherently inclusive either. Today, facial recognition algorithms misidentify non-white and non-male faces, leaving black women particularly exposed to their use. A study of facial recognition software found an error rate of 0.8 percent for light-skinned men and 34.7 percent for dark-skinned women. The use of such technology is both potentially troubling in the way it attempts to ‘control’ spaces, and is also likely to include socially discriminating features either by design or flaw. Designing a more inclusive ‘normal’ It is not only women who are impacted by these issues, but everyone who exists outside of this narrow definition of normal. Often these people find themselves navigating a city that doesn’t quite work for them. It is women, children, the elderly, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, people of colour and many others who often must adapt themselves, their routines and ambitions to fit. When their needs are acknowledged, they are often accompanied by the implication that these are only for the minority, and somehow optional considerations. These people are, instead, the majority. To design the contemporary city, we must understand their lived experiences. As city-makers, we can be part of challenging the falsehood of ‘normalness’ and create more inclusive cities. By applying ethnographic and user research to design and policy, we can shift beyond assumptions and begin to gather meaningful data about what people need from the urban experience. Starting with people, their needs, values and behaviours circumvents existing opinions; it’s a way of grounding the conversation in clearly defined opportunities for transformation. To do so, we must speak to people. There is no substitute for listening, observing and designing with communities through thoughtful and collaborative qualitative and quantitative research. We cannot presume to understand people without this. Publications Travelling in a Woman’s Shoes Find out more about the needs and travel behaviours of women in a study commissioned by Transport Infrastructure Ireland. Download Gender and the transport experience Public transport is a key context for this approach. Last year, on the precipice of the pandemic, we worked with Transport Infrastructure Ireland on a study about women and their needs in transport. Responding to a globally glaring gap in gender-disaggregated data and the urgent need to decarbonise transport, we set out to understand how transport could be designed to also cater for the needs of women. Through one-to-one interviews in people’s homes and ride-alongs on transport, behavioural observations on the network and a 1,000-person representative survey, the research has led to some sharply defined research insights, presenting timely challenges for designers and policy-makers. The findings respond to the following questions: Modes of transport: how can sustainable transport modes compete with the car? Family roles: how can an understanding of the family unit influence sustainable mode choices? Being safe: how can transport feel safe for women? Being inclusive: how can transport consider the diverse needs and contexts of all women? Driving change: how can we accelerate sustainable behavioural change? The report is alive with stories of women we spoke to (although their identities have been protected), whose personal experiences resonated with many female stakeholders, producing surprise and horror from many male audiences. We learn about Alice who feels vulnerable waiting at the bus stop after finishing an early evening shift at a café and waits until the last moment to run and catch the bus. Or, Amanda, an aspiring psychologist, who spends much of her day driving around in traffic, ferrying her son and the children she cares for around, leaving little time for much else. It is only by pinpointing the critical issues and unmet needs of women that we can enable sustainable behaviour change and make transport gender neutral. We owe it to each other to make the urban experience more inclusive. The huge challenges to cities caused by the pandemic have illustrated the need to continuously analyse what people really need and expect from their cities. People-centred design, strategic design and user research methods set out a blueprint for us to do so. So, let’s course-correct, challenge long-outdated (and over-gendered) assumptions, and create cities that work for everyone.

26,Converting commitments into canceling carbon,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/converting-commitments-into-canceling-carbon,,"In the run up to COP26, it seemed like net-zero-carbon commitments were everywhere, even on the commercials of my favorite TV show. With so many stakeholder, investor, governmental, and corporate good intentions at play, the newly found fervor here in the US runs the risk of eager misalignment. Nevertheless, I choose to hope that we’re finally rising to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s call: “Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net-zero CO2 emissions.” With building operations, materials, and construction contributing almost 40% of global annual CO2 emissions, we who create the built environment are at the heart of taming the emissions of its legacy and future. Architecture 2030 has long preached a three-part formula for net-zero-carbon buildings: Energy efficiency + electrification + renewable energy = net-zero (operational) carbon With electricity companies now committing (or mandated) to full decarbonization, reducing embodied carbon within the material supply chain is the next focus. We know the path; we have the technology and now we finally appear to have the collective will. So the only question is: how fast can we turn our “new decade resolutions” into sustainable carbon diets? What we’ve learned from working with early adopters is that making progress, while challenging, is also surprisingly simple. It simply takes insight and ingenuity to position yourself for implementation. Insight – “You can’t manage what you can’t measure.” (Peter Drucker) Prior to this age of carbon accountability, many building operators judged their success on improving energy efficiency and stabilizing utility costs. In a few jurisdictions, if the buildings were large enough, perhaps they were required to report annual energy use. But decarbonization requires the diagnostic skills of a forensic analyst: outcomes must be disaggregated to find root causes of excessive emissions so that they can be fixed. For instance, when the City of Boston wanted to understand pathways to achieve its 2050 carbon neutral goal, the buildings sector was its top priority. Using digital analytics, Arup’s analysis helped the City understand the problem better and focus attention on the decarbonization of existing buildings, which is 80% of the City’s building stock, by 2050. Our work on Carbon Free Boston work served as the foundation for the law now known as BERDO 2.0. When navigating significant transitions, data-driven strategy development helps to build influence, credibility, and confidence in the decision makers to better equip them to negotiate support for critical stakeholders. The State of Massachusetts’s development of its 2050 Decarbonization Roadmap provides a similar example. Again, data analysis was used to discover that the residential sector was not only the second largest contributor of greenhouse gases, but that 27% of the entire State’s emissions came from residential direct-fired fossil fuel use. Insights like these lead to focus, and focus allows for problem-solving. Perhaps the greatest problems to solve in decarbonization are the cost and speed of change. When NYSERDA was looking to test various electrification policies for the New York State Carbon Neutral Buildings Roadmap, granular hourly analyses demonstrated the cost effectiveness of technology packages in widespread application and the associated impacts on the electrical grid, leading to the development of policy and incentive mechanisms to support market adoption of newer technologies. Ingenuity – “Vulnerability is the birthplace of ingenuity, creativity, and change.” (Brené Brown) While it would be easy to take a technocratic approach to society’s decarbonization, it is surely not preferred. What we have learned from city-scale climate action planning is that equity demands that we approach any problem by first respecting the wisdom of those closest to it and crowdsourcing their creativity. For example, a facilitated conversation with over 40 stakeholders at the San Francisco International Airport about the benefits and obstacles to pursuing decarbonization aspirations under the existing capital improvement processes ultimately led to SFO’s ten-year plan that reflects not only the details of the capital improvement plan but also the augmented staffing to support it. The Bay Area Low-Carbon Concrete Code is another instance of engaging practitioners in an industry, this time to reduce the embodied carbon of their almost ubiquitously used product. By reframing concrete’s embodied carbon problem as one shared among designer, contractor, and mix provider, all parties were able to share just how far they could afford to deviate from business as usual and still meet standard budgets and schedules. With this information, the team was able to identify the key drivers for the over-specification of cement, test five sample low-carbon mix designs, and develop template specification language acceptable to all parties. There is a level of ingenuity found in multidisciplinary excellence. Integrating the practicalities of mutually beneficial solutions requires that the cost and benefit to each party over time is tested against the full diversity of stakeholder perspectives. In short, we all need to trust that we are all experts in the ways of the past and together are on a journey to become advocates for the future. But what happens when the past offers no model of success? We must lean even more heavily on ingenuity. With no option to strengthen the existing structure and a desire to maximize prime leasable area, the solution to heightening the building at 80 M Street while remaining within the older loading limits was a mass timber overbuild. Once the fire-rating equivalency of the timber was proven, even the weight of finishes could be eliminated. The solution to a structural capacity problem became the best performing option overall due to its lower cost, lower disruption, and lower embodied carbon as compared to standard construction methods. Innovation so often finds us in our moments of greatest challenge. Bloomberg Center at Cornell Tech - the anchor educational building for a net-zero-energy campus on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Implementation – “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” (attributed to Voltaire) Yet with all this insight and ingenuity, it still feels like we’ve just started to scratch the surface of decarbonization in the industry. Even the most enthusiastic team will arrive at a crossroads where a single difficulty could determine whether the initiative will travel the path of organizational apathy or the path of promise. The reality is that carbon management requires change management and a certain willingness to commit to action even in the face of continued unknowns. Just take the notion of a net-zero energy building itself. It might well conjure up visions of small buildings covered in solar panels, but compare this to the 160,000ft2 Bloomberg Center at Cornell Tech, the anchor educational building for a net-zero-energy campus on Roosevelt Island. Having applied almost every best practice design method available, the innovation hub’s process loads remained so high that it took the roofs of two buildings to host the one acre photovoltaic array by “scale-jumping” beyond the project’s boundary. The 65,000ft2 Wilkes Elementary School similarly pivoted towards future proofing with its “net-zero ready” status. Designed to provide a very low 35 kBtu/ft2/year energy use intensity, this all-electric building runs on Washington state’s very-low-carbon power until 100% clean energy is truly available. The district’s strategy of getting to low (even if not quite “no”) net-zero carbon back in 2012 allowed the project’s small capital budget to fund more student-focused sustainability features by foregoing the first cost burden of on-site generation. Ultimately, the success of decarbonization is realized not through intention but through verification. As part of the MarketZero pilot project funded by the California Energy Commission, Whole Foods Market agreed to adopt as many low-carbon solutions as could fit within the $2m grant, a four-month construction period, and its high traffic 25,000ft2 San Francisco grocery store. With 100 human-generated starter ideas, machine learning unlocked the potential for up to 74% energy cost savings available to stores of this type. Measurements for the completed retrofit have confirmed what the algorithm projected for the subset of packages incorporated, namely 44% operational energy reduction and 60% annual energy cost savings. With deep savings like these, enough on-site renewable energy can be produced on the roof to offset annual energy use, making the site “net-zero ready” until photovoltaic panels are installed. While there are still many questions and work to be done to make our industry more sustainable, the time to act is now. Momentum for net-zero carbon implementation is growing, drawing upon all the insight and ingenuity we can muster as the creators and caretakers of the built environment.

27,Rethinking urban roadways: Post-pandemic prioritization of space,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/rethinking-urban-roadways-post-pandemic-prioritization-of-space,,"Our virtual Arup Live Event, “Rethinking urban roadways: Post-pandemic prioritization of space,” on July 29, 2021 assembled a panel to step back and reflect on the role of our urban roadways on equity, justice, and the environment. Many roadways in urban areas have fragmented communities of color, physically reinforcing historic injustices. The panel explored redesigns that redress these wrongs and prioritize livability, especially as it relates to the use and influence of our streets and public places. Arup’s subject matter experts were joined by Stephanie Pollack, the Acting Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), as well as the following esteemed panelists: Keith Baker, Executive Director of Reconnect Rondo; Tilly Chang, Executive Director of the San Francisco County Transit Authority; Vineet Gupta, Director of Planning for the Boston Transportation Department; and Jeffrey LeFrancois, Executive Director of the Meatpacking District. Arup’s Director of Cities and Sustainable Real Estate Brian Swett, Senior Planner Megan Gee, and Senior Urban Designer and Planner James Francisco continue the panel’s conversation about where and how to start rethinking our urban roadways. Administrator Pollack tells how the Federal Highway Administration started as the Bureau of Public Roads, and she retains this multimodal vision of the FHWA. Why is this shift to a more expansive perspective on our roads so significant? Megan: Stephanie’s broad definition of what infrastructure can be is so important. Roads have never been just for cars, they are a thoroughfare, a place for people to gather, an economic enabler — they drive all kinds of things beyond just vehicles on pavement. We need to think about these projects holistically. On and off ramps for freeways and highways in urban environments cause significant disruption to the urban fabric underneath them, dangerous conditions, high speeds, poor visibility, not to mention blight. When we examine lifecycle costs and benefits, we don't tend to consider the human costs, such as safety issues, and community disruption including the incredibly high asthma and cancer rates of people living adjacent to these polluted places. Despite what people expect from adding a ramp or a lane, it almost never reduces congestion or adds enough capacity to justify the overall cost. James: Unfortunately, processes to prioritize and upgrade city infrastructure often occur in isolation. Many times, highways are designed with only traffic performance in mind, and coupled with very real financial and political pressures, highway expansion is often opted for as the default solution. The fact that over 475,000 households and a million people were displaced for our highway system, which fundamentally prioritizes car mobility over everything else, highlights the importance of inter-agency collaboration and a multidisciplinary approach involving city planners, strategic advisors, engineers, and transportation planners. Engaging the community through a thoughtful, context-based approach, we can start innovating and providing feasible solutions that increase opportunity, promote affordable access, and reconnect our neighborhoods. There was a lot of discussion about the key role of community members in rethinking our roadways. Why is this so critical and how might it best be achieved? Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area Brian: The Arup Live Event conversation focused on shifting the power of the stakeholder by saying, “You're not a stakeholder in my project, you are the owner of the project. The outcome is yours, and the success is yours to define.” Keith Baker explained that for Reconnect Rondo — it isn’t a Minnesota Department of Transportation project, or a St. Paul Department of Transportation project — this is a Rondo project, and the agencies are supporters in implementing community-driven ideas regarding their defined needs and vision for success. The urban roadway infrastructure we have today is largely the result of the programmatic goals and criteria of the funding and financing structures at the time it was built. And we have clearly prioritized moving cars and trucks quickly for many decades in these programs. We need to create robust funding and financing programs that truly support multimodal and human-centered approaches to urban roadways. State, federal, and local governments can make sure that we're investing in community voices, so that they can lead planning exercises, build their own organizational structures, and then identify for themselves issues of concern, how they want to address their priorities, and define success. It’s a much better process. You have a community that is prepared and ready to engage with solving urban roadway issues at various scales. Equitable community engagement also demands a holistic conversation about compensation and support so that voices are heard and elevated. So, in addition to direct compensation for people’s time, we have to talk about childcare, the timing of meetings and other outreach, and investing in language translation. It's the whole package that empowers a just and racially and socially diverse approach and outcome. The webinar revealed several experimental strategies induced by the pandemic era to improve the public realm. What might we learn from those pilots and how they might scale up to advance transformation for our infrastructure? Megan: I love Vineet’s metaphor of “planting seeds.” Piloting small projects can provide immediate feedback and they also allow us to plant seeds of change in people's minds, giving them an experience of what that future could be. We can get a better sense of community attitudes by trialing interventions rather than building big and permanent, seeing how they work, and adjusting our approach. We can use these projects as an opportunity for behavior change in the minds of both the community and practitioners like us. That said, it’s so important that these quick builds are designed with sensitivity to all users, which doesn’t always happen, for example, accommodating the needs of someone who is blind or in a wheelchair. We must design for all ages and abilities. James: A great example of piloting is NYC Open Streets in the Meatpacking District, where we worked closely with the Business Improvement District, and were able to quickly respond to the various challenges throughout the pandemic. Working directly with the community, we were able to pilot innovative streetscape solutions that layered complimentarily with City agency standards. Additionally, we were able to immediately quantify the increase in footfall and sales related to the pedestrian-priority pilots, which really resonated, because everyone was focused on economic recovery at the time. We were able to prove that stores next to the pedestrianized street had a 30% increase in sales directly due to our intervention. We are going above and beyond to understand the broader impacts such as the carbon emissions savings, how a decrease in noise immediately relates to health benefits, and how access to exercise, walkable environments, and having safe places for people to socialize has positive outcomes for mental wellbeing. This experience is entirely transferable and scalable. Working with the Meatpacking District, we have the opportunity to create a feasible a model for neighborhoods across the city to follow. With their blessing, we have been able to disseminate our knowledge and advocate for better public space in three additional neighborhoods with vulnerable populations. We are providing pro-bono services in these historic neighborhoods of color through Arup’s community engagement fund. Bike lanes in Barcelona Brian: There was a lot of conversation during the event around the importance of programs. Transformational change around how we use our urban public realm and our roadways requires a full-scale strategy including policy, projects, and programs. Projects are the physical infrastructure, and policy dictates the guidelines around how we define success for these projects. Programs support the equitable use of this public infrastructure. For example, it’s not enough to just build bike lanes. You need programs that provide citizens of all economic means with access to bikes in order to utilize these bike lanes equitably. That may mean providing subsidies, or a means-adjusted bike-share program, or any number of alternatives but you have to think it through holistically. The pandemic provided this unique forced experiment in rethinking urban public spaces, in particular, our roadways. Now, with the leadership and ambition that’s out there, not only at the FHWA but, as we saw in the Arup Live Event, also in key cities and community groups around the country, I am tremendously optimistic. The public is now more open than ever to rethinking the urban public realm in ways that they wouldn’t have considered two or three years ago. We are at a moment of inflection where we can redefine what success means for our urban roadways for decades to come."
28,Profiles in Design: Cities Leader Katherine Perez,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/profiles-in-design-cities-leader-katherine-perez,,"Starchitects aside, we hear little about the individuals whose cumulative decisions shape the built environment. In our Profiles in Design series, we chat with engineers, architects, policymakers, and designers about their lives, careers, and daily aspirations. Katherine, an associate principal at Arup, integrates strategy, economics, planning, and finance to deliver projects and initiatives that directly and dramatically shape our cities. Below, Katherine discusses the future needs of our cities from equity to zero emissions, the influence and inspiration she gathers from her students, and her values-driven ambition to change the ways we live, work, and interact for the better. Picture circa 1975, Coachella, California. Katherine with younger sister Marisol and younger brother Henry. What elements or anecdotes from your background inform the perspectives you have today? My grandparents were farm workers in the Coachella Valley of California and my mother was a lifelong schoolteacher. When I was a child, she would tell me, “If it was easy, everybody would do it.” She knew how to propel me forward. Ever since, that’s been one of my lifelong mottos — I’m not just like everybody else. I want to continually grow, evolve, and challenge myself. And that means continually seeking out and evaluating where I can make the most meaningful impacts for my community and my city. Prior to joining Arup in 2017, I served as Deputy Mayor, ran for State Senate, started my own company, led nonprofit organizations, and dedicated my time to numerous regional, state, and national initiatives. Now, as the Cities Leader in the Los Angeles office, I bring that historic perspective to exciting projects throughout Southern California and statewide. It’s an incredibly exciting opportunity to be able to influence the future of the city, particularly as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 LA Olympics. Katherine Perez as California High Speed Rail Commissioner in 2014, with California State Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins and HSR Team Michelle Boehm in Fresno, California. My background is in urban planning and I’ve had the privilege of being an adjunct professor for nearly 15 years, teaching land-use planning, transit-oriented development, and community engagement at USC and UCLA, and at organizations like the Ford Foundation. I hope that with my teaching experience and work as the LA Cities Leader, I bring a perspective of collaboration and inclusivity that offers a new paradigm for how and why decisions are made. How did you first become interested in urban planning? It was serendipity. My undergraduate degree was in political science with a minor in Russian. This was in 1988, right before the Berlin Wall came down. I wanted to become an international diplomat and communicate across many different groups. But I had a friend at UCLA who had just completed the urban planning program and she said, “Katherine, they’re building freeways through our neighborhoods.” New freeways and train lines were being planned straight through minority-rich, immigrant neighborhoods in LA, and at that time, there weren’t many people defending them or protecting their rights. So, I thought, “Here is a situation I can help my community and be a bridge between the decisionmakers and residents.” What has your experience been like as a person of color, and as a woman, in navigating the AEC industry? I’ve been in the industry for over 25 years and, at first, it was a very lonely place for women. I didn’t have many mentors. And being a woman of color and LGBT, it was difficult to be taken seriously. I often felt I was involved in certain projects only as a token. And when I was included, one of the first things I’d have to say is, “Hey, I’m the only woman in this room. I’m the only person of color in this room. We have to diversify the voices.” While the industry has been slow to evolve, I am no longer alone. Today, I have colleagues who will say, “This group isn’t reflective of the community we’re working in and we need to bring those perspectives into the process” and this is a huge step forward. With your background in planning and urban design, have you seen a shift in thinking about our cities, particularly around ownership and access? In the Los Angeles office, we’re working in partnership with community-based organizations to better understand issues around inclusion — because we know that urban design interventions don’t affect all Angelenos in the same way. Take the al fresco dining interventions amidst COVID-19, for instance. As an urban planner, my first thought was that it was a smarter way to use the street than creating parking spaces for cars. And, of course, these outdoor experiences are more inviting than hot asphalt while supporting the small businesses trying to survive a pandemic. Katherine Perez with Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia. However, what our BIPOC colleagues have pointed out is that this continues the privatization of the public realm. If you were someone who would ride your bike or walk through that lane to get to work, now you have to be aware of how you’re perceived in that space. And sometimes it can feel contentious and not welcoming. These conversations have made me more aware that design decisions can have unintended consequences. We make one decision to solve one problem but then it can create a negative impact on another group. Now we’re asking, “What does this mean for people who used this space before? How can we involve them on what they’d like to see?” What are the most pressing challenges, or most exciting opportunities, facing the built environment today? As the zero emissions leader for the LA office working with and across our energy, sustainability, buildings, and infrastructure practices, what I see ahead is a complete and transformational shift. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address our climate-changing behaviors. I feel fortunate to be in California where, in my opinion, we are pioneering the path forward for the rest of the country. But this revolution needs to be inclusive of all communities and not just benefit the affluent neighborhoods. All communities need access to improved infrastructure that will change the world for the better. We’re not going to get everything right and some folks see that as a glass half empty. But I see it as incredibly full. Future generations are going to look back and say, “They made some mistakes, but they shifted us in the right direction. Hard decisions were made to pivot when we needed to, together, to make permanent change.” Katherine’s children Lucia (23), Diego (25) and Antonia (23). What makes you hopeful for the future? The students graduating from our colleges and universities are so smart. They aren’t cynical or afraid of failure. They’re progressive and ambitious and it is powerful to see. Teaching them has been one of the most rewarding roles of my life. And for these students, equity isn’t just a word. It’s fundamental to how they think. It’s a critical challenge to our current systems. The students of today and tomorrow are going to accelerate the change we want to see because they’ll accept nothing less. They challenge me to reflect on old principles that aren’t working for everybody. Their energy accelerates my efforts to grow both as a colleague at Arup and in my community as a person."
29,Resilient cities are fit for many futures,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/resilient-cities-are-fit-for-many-futures,,"Our cities are changing, but they continue to be sought-after places for people to live, providing convenient access to jobs, education, entertainment, health care and community. However, our burgeoning cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to many shocks and stresses that can impact lives and the quality of life. How do we reduce these impacts? And how do we become more resilient? We need to plan differently and recognise that we don’t have only one future, but many possible futures. To be fit for many futures, there are three fundamental questions to ask. What disruptions do we need to plan for? Disruption is about changing the ‘everyday way of life’. We often think about negative disruptions, but a major event like the Olympic Games or a festival will disrupt the everyday city and have tremendously positive outcomes. Disruption can be short in time and narrow in impact – a sporting event or a storm – and very particular to a place, or it can be long in duration and wide in impact, like what many have experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. Longer disruptions, which affect a large population, challenges us to think about preparing for similar scenarios, such as sea level rise. If we are to plan for these events, recognising that we can’t plan for every possibility, we need to prioritise the disruptions that are particular to place. These are likely to be a combination of very local issues and wider, shared issues. Getting the priority of disruptions right at the outset is key, and for that we have tools like the City Resilience Index at our disposal. The City Resilience Index, developed by Arup with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, provides a comprehensive, technically robust, globally applicable basis for measuring city resilience. It is comprised of 52 indicators, which are assessed based on responses to 156 questions; through a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. The responses are aggregated and presented in relation to the 12 goals (or indices) in the Framework. How can we understand possible impacts and plan for appropriate actions? Unlike any other time in human existence, we have digital tools to understand and model complex interactions of variables that are common to disruption scenarios in a virtual environment. We are able to ‘twin’ our physical cities with virtual cities, mapping visible components of our city such as buildings and landscape, as well as the invisible – the quality of our air, the impact of heat and the movement of people and goods. We increasingly understand the inter-relationships of these components, and how one variable affects one or many other issues. With this model in hand, we can then test the impacts of the disruptions we have determined are appropriate for a particular city. Flood modelling for example, is well advanced, but increasingly we can do this for many other disruptions. Once twinned, we can propose and test possible solutions, to see what options are available and what is the best way to prepare to address such impacts. We often think about negative disruptions, but a major event like the Olympic Games or a festival will disrupt the everyday city and have tremendously positive outcomes. How can we prepare for responding to disruption? Organisations like our tremendous emergency services, both professional and volunteer, will remain at the foundation of our resilient cities when negative disruptions occur. But we also need to plan for the wider scenarios that could eventuate. To augment how we currently plan our cities, we develop ‘urban overlays’ – physical devices and organisational capacity that could be temporarily deployed in a particular scenario. Examples might be flood barriers or emergency water supplies, barriers for a cycle race, or as we see now, temporary health care facilities. Simply put, we use existing infrastructure and devices in unexpected ways to meet an urgent need, for example the interim repurposing of trains in France into hospitals. Disruptions, whether large or small, global or local, positive or negative, are affecting cities at an increasingly rapid frequency. To be ready and resilient, we need to understand the priorities of each place and recognise that there are shared challenges and local challenges. We need to embrace digital tools and systems that allow us to model impacts and test solutions, and empowered by this understanding, develop urban overlay strategies for our cities to be fit for many futures.

30,Three steps for cleaner air in cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/three-steps-for-cleaner-air-in-cities,,"Clean air is a crucial issue on our cities’ agenda, and it’s no surprise with almost 7 million air quality linked deaths globally and air pollution remaining constant in 2020’s strictest global lockdown measures. We have already started the clean air revolution with renewable energy, including zero-emission transport and energy plan initiatives in Australia and BreatheLife in Singapore; however, clean air in cities needs a renewed focus. While starting the conversation for cleaner air is essential, it can often lack clear objectives leaving leaders unsure about starting. Without clear steps toward improving air quality, cities risk losing their liveability standards and opportunities for change and investment. The good news is that cities can improve air quality before it becomes too late, and there are many ways leaders can act now while learning from cities around the globe grappling with an air quality crisis. Here are three essential steps leaders can take to make air quality real for their cities and how a Clean Air Programme can help them get started. 1. Embrace imperfection Waiting for a perfect solution for solving air quality and having cleaner air will delay progress. Too often, clean air action is stalled by discussions on failings, debating technology solutions, and prioritising resources. Visible effort and willingness to try new ideas and reinforce principles will have multiple benefits and should not await developing a flawless national strategy. Piloting a clean air or low emission zone can be a powerful way to frame air quality issues and make the benefits visible. Since introducing an Ultra Low Emission Zone in Central London in 2016, limiting the number of older high polluting vehicles travelling through the city has seen a 36% reduction in roadside NO2 and a 31% reduction in NOx emissions. If designed well, a pilot or trial can help cities build support and activate an evidence-based discussion. Near-term actions like this can help inform and build momentum toward a comprehensive response to the clean air challenge. 2. Establish a baseline Cities must rapidly generate more data about air quality to establish a starting point, and the easiest way to uncover a city’s air quality baseline is through increased monitoring. When air quality monitoring stations are sparse and located in limited settings, it’s impossible to understand the real cost of air pollution in a city, including in schools, hospitals, and precincts. Increased monitoring can be cost effective and get the community closer to air quality data. Low-cost sensors can complement data produced from advanced monitoring networks and help document activity changes in the community. The Breathe London community is a network of affordable and easy-to-install air quality sensors helping to produce the best possible data set and run by the London Air Quality Network. Citizen and community-led monitoring makes local air quality monitoring more accessible and improves the visibility of local air quality challenges. Monitoring improvements like this can help improve air quality visibility in cities and inform decision making for cleaner air options. 3. Make clean air personal Change requires a new narrative. Local data can create a story to help government perception of air quality shift in the right direction. But air quality isn’t just a city issue; pollution is personal, and air quality can be entirely different across a single city, suburb, or street. Humans experience the impact of air quality at a local scale in their communities, and as a result, the message needs to reflect this. The critical challenge is making the invisible visible. Australia’s bushfire crisis in early 2020 made air quality a news headline, and citizens shared a unique experience about the meaning of clean air. Citizens could see and feel the impacts of harmful particulates, and very quickly, air quality became personal. While this has helped shaped the narrative for one city, it needs to evolve. We can also solve the problem and shape the conversation from a city, precinct, and building level. Targeted solutions could include adopting green infrastructure in a city and introducing low emission zones in precincts. It is also clear that’s individuals value wellness with the momentum of green and well buildings in Australasia. Maximising the airtightness of buildings and then facilitating both active and passive ventilation solutions can help manage air quality and energy demand. Using local data, leaders can target messages that enable government and communities to connect with the challenge. It can also be a powerful tool for starting the conversation, driving collaboration, and unifying community perception. Get started with a Clean Air Programme Implementing a Clean Air Programme can help leaders put these steps into action with confidence and expertise. A Clean Air Programme is a suite of interventions, pilots, and trials to improve air quality in urban environments. It takes a chronological approach from baselining and monitoring air quality to implementing change and maintaining air quality in growing cities. As seen with the city-region of Greater Manchester, a Clean Air Programme can be a policy driver bringing all stakeholders together around a common agenda. Ahead of COP26, the UN calls leaders to support policy and programmes that drive action to protect communities and natural habitats. There is a clear imperative for cities to invest in clean air for better environmental, health and social outcomes. It’s time for cities to get ahead of a crisis and invest in a clean air future now.

31,"Transforming homes for decarbonisation, safety and wellbeing",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/transforming-homes-for-decarbonisation-safety-and-wellbeing,,"Decarbonising existing homes and improving building safety are massive but vital priorities. Local authorities and housing providers currently have a unique opportunity to combine multiple benefits in a single action that would accelerate progress to net zero carbon, make homes safer and improve people’s quality of life. A joint approach to tackling these issues will save money, reduce disruption to residents and increase the resilience of our housing stock. It’s a moment to think big and transform the way we live. A nationwide issue The UK’s housing stock is responsible for 20% of the country’s annual carbon emissions. Given that 80-85% of today’s homes are likely to still be in use in 2050, retrofitting buildings to reduce their energy consumption and remove fossil fuels needs to be carried out urgently and at scale. Beyond emissions, the health effects of poor quality housing are also clearer than ever. According to the Building Research Establishment, housing may have a similar impact on health as smoking or alcohol use. It’s clear that investment is needed, the key is to combine our response to these priorities in an efficient and effective way. The timing is right for new thinking. New regulation is about to reshape the equation for the UK’s housing industry. The Building Safety Bill 2021, and forthcoming Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund will enforce and promote safety and energy efficiency upgrades. The question is how to unlock economies of scale on such a major programme of housing improvements, finding ways to unlock funding and still provide people-led solutions for homes. Addressing wider social goals Energy efficiency upgrades don’t just lower emissions, they can improve people’s health. They can reduce childhood asthma, resulting in fewer lost school days, boosting educational performance and life chances. Improved housing can also cut levels of depression and anxiety in adults, reducing workplace absenteeism and supporting productivity for employers. Cost-effective retrofits to the poorest housing is a chance to help the most vulnerable in society. This can include lifting people out of fuel poverty and addressing health issues caused by poor ventilation, as recently outlined in the All Party Parliamentary Group White Paper for Healthy Homes and Buildings (supported by work from Arup). Additionally, as climate change drives more extreme temperatures, summer overheating problems are likely to rise. Energy efficiency improvements that take health and wellbeing into consideration can tackle this proactively, through measures such as shading and window designs that avoid the need for high carbon emission air conditioning units in the future. It’s clear that the traditional finance model is far too simplistic, focusing on direct costs and savings. When wider social benefits are considered, such as health, employment, regeneration and tax revenues, as well as asset value gains from higher EPC ratings, the economic case becomes even more compelling. Featured service Building retrofit The retrofit of existing buildings is crucial to support our path to meeting net-zero carbon targets. Our expertise enables us to transform and reuse buildings in exciting and sustainable ways. Discover our retrofit expertise Realising economies of scale while meeting individual needs With 29 million homes across the UK, there are economies of scale from approaching common housing typologies with a repeatable solution and large scale plan. Our use of data-analytics and modelling has helped to determine the scale and scope of retrofit interventions necessary to deliver net-zero heating most efficiently on a city-wide scale, developing business cases that capture some of the co-benefits. This approach enables cities to plan delivery and funding programmes at scale, but they will then require delivery sensitive to the local community and individual residents. Local dialogue provides opportunity to create social value by providing insights to improve residents’ lives, particularly in housing estate retrofit projects, for example through outdoor space enhancements or provision of community amenity. Finance and timing issues Finance is often a barrier to broadening a project’s scope – but given the convergence of these housing issues, we have to make the case for boldness and an integrated approach. Even where there are higher initial costs, packaging projects in innovative ways can open access to new finance opportunities. Working in partnership with local authorities and housing providers, it’s clear there’s a role for blended finance, combining public and private sector capital, grants and borrowing to fund different parts of a project. Defining and certifying decarbonisation as part of the works can also unlock green loans. Over the long term, a joined-up approach to retrofit is likely to generate financial savings on capital and operational costs, as well as increasing resilience of housing stock and improving quality of life. There might also be opportunities within these programmes, to unlock individual sites by sensitively adding housing density and facilities, providing much needed additional housing. Ultimately, we believe it will simplify life for local authorities and housing providers too, so they no longer face urgent issues separately and consecutively. So, how do we begin? First, the Government must invest in large scale retrofit of existing homes for decarbonisation, safety and well being and provide support for innovative private investment. Although funding is becoming available for social housing, more will be needed and all homes need addressing to meet climate targets and safety requirements. Second, local authorities, housing providers and the construction industry must define an efficient way to tackle all these issues in a joined-up fashion. All stakeholders will need to collaborate and think creatively to make sure investment is used to the greatest effect and the lowest disruption. And residents must be central to the process of upgrading their homes. We are keen to listen to local authorities and housing providers to understand the specific challenges they are facing and how we could help – from prioritising projects to opening access to finance. I really hope that property owners and the industry recognise this time for the unique opportunity it presents. It’s a moment to truly make a difference, to innovate, and to change lives for the better."
32,A new vision for urban highway infrastructure,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-new-vision-for-urban-highway-infrastructure,,"Constructed starting in the 1950s, the US Interstate Highway System, connecting the country with over 47,000 miles of state highways, was seen as the pathway to a prosperous economic future for the country. While the economic impact is undeniable, this growth came with social and environmental costs that endure today as urban highway segments cut through communities of color. Roughly one million people were displaced to make way for urban highway infrastructure. The post-WWII preeminence of the automobile justified carving through cities — often systematically bisecting already redlined neighborhoods in the name of urban renewal. Unlike some predominately white neighborhoods that were able to fight back, such as New York City’s Greenwich Village, many communities of color lacked the resources or political clout to resist these changes. Black neighborhoods disproportionately lost homes, businesses, churches, schools, and parks through eminent domain. For those who remained, the highway became, and continues to be, a redline in concrete, enabling vehicles but restricting human mobility and effectively creating a barrier to opportunity, community stability, and even good health with the asymmetrical impact of traffic-related air pollution and its correlated illnesses like asthma. Today, with many highway segments over 50 years old and in states of disrepair and obsolescence, we are at a critical juncture. We must rethink how our highways disrupt urban areas and how roadway redesign can be foundational to addressing historic injustices. To help right historical harms, American cities are actively reconceiving highway segments to better reconnect neighborhoods. And federal funding is further elevating community-building approaches with infrastructure rehabilitation such as removing, reducing, or redesigning highway segments. Brooklyn Bridge, New York: Arup, alongside BIG Architects, reconceived New York’s Brooklyn Bridge as a multimodal facility that reconnects the street grid, provides safe pedestrian and cycling paths, and unlocks 32 acres of potential new development and public space. Beyond moving cars Our transportation priorities no longer focus exclusively on vehicle performance. The value of reduced air and noise pollution and walkable, open streets became especially apparent when the pandemic ground city traffic to a halt. Innovative transportation design that considers the broader value to communities and our planet encompasses a wider set of outcomes including equity and justice, safe and accessible streets, clean air, and economic benefits for local communities. Climate change alone demands a recalibration of transit modes. Carbon emissions from vehicles in the US comprised 25.8% of GHG emissions in 2019. Yet now gasoline-powered car culture is beginning to give way to multiple modalities, requiring forward-thinking transportation planning to safely accommodate this diversity. Transit must also embrace access for all demographics and consider the nondriving elderly or those without a personal vehicle. Our priorities towards city life have also changed. Planners and developers recognize how urban public spaces that are aesthetically pleasing, uplifting, and celebrate cultural identities and community pride also deliver accrued value to adjacent development. As cities become more desirable places to live, however, many poor residents are being priced out, aggravating a new cycle of suburbanization of poverty. To protect and keep communities of color intact, some cities are employing a range of housing strategies along with the understanding that well-integrated transportation infrastructure in cities is critical for neighborhoods to thrive and create wealth. Lower Hudson Transit Link, New York: Arup developed the integrated corridor management system for New York’s I-287 corridor that mitigated a range of traffic issues and provides public health benefits without capital-intensive roadway expansions. Strategies for community outcomes Every location will have its unique challenges, contexts, and needs, calling for different combinations of solutions, but all present an opportunity for neighborhood roadways to be used to rebuild communities while managing traffic demand. Highways and spurs in metropolitan areas can be redesigned to be sunk underground, covered, converted to boulevards, redirected, or — in some cases — removed altogether, thereby knitting back together neighborhoods divided long ago. Presidio Parkway, San Francisco: For a segment of the Presidio Parkway, a section of US 101in San Francisco, Arup designed two tunnels to connect the National Park with the waterfront and create a new programmed parkland on top. ©Proehl Studios Tunneling roadways to allow for land reconnection is a strategy that can both improve traffic and public access to nature, as with the Presidio Parkway in San Francisco. Burying or converting elevated highways to street-level boulevards reconnects neighborhoods with active mobility pathways and open, daylit vistas. California provides design guidance for state highways that also serve as main streets to accommodate access for all travelers — a concept that has long been employed in Europe, such as in Belfast and London. Additionally, cities can use streets to create quality public spaces while addressing resiliency and climate change, like the Greener Grangetown “rain garden” drainage system in Cardiff, Wales. Greener Grangetown, Wales: For a drainage system in Cardiff, Wales, Arup’s scheme included “rain gardens” on roadway medians and borders to capture and redirect stormwater into a nearby river while also enhancing the environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Leading with impacted communities Whatever solutions are applied, transportation reinvestment should focus on equitable city-building and economic development policy tools to ensure historically impacted communities are key beneficiaries of newly connected, livable neighborhoods. For neighborhoods that have been fragmented, this work can include locating descendants of displaced residents and appointing these families with leadership roles in the rebuilding process. A wealth of community coalitions composed of dedicated residents, local government officials, and activists are advocating to “rightsize” urban highways in cities across the country. These groups are well-positioned to lead the process of rebuilding, owning, and reconnecting their neighborhoods. Planners, architects, engineers, and economists are supporting these non-profit and grassroots efforts through multidisciplinary and context-sensitive design solutions, which are making their way into state highway projects. Sacramento Waterfront, Sacramento: As plans for I-5 investments, Sacramento Valley Station, the Downtown Railyards, and the waterfronts along both sides of the Sacramento River progress, Arup convened a charette to imagine a more equitable, connected, and sustainable Sacramento. Ensuring progress for people Urban regeneration projects guided by such neighborhood interests will inevitably illuminate components critical to healthy neighborhoods beyond improved transportation like housing, economic opportunities, small business incubators, and community services such as parks and health clinics. It is imperative to have direct community participation and input in planning city transportation infrastructure. As part of the Rose Quarter Improvement Project of Portland, Oregon, the majority-Black community displaced by the construction of I-5 in the 1960s is guiding the vision for a cover over the buried highway, cultivating community wealth, health, and cohesion. I-5 Rose Quarter Improvement Project, Portland: Using community workshop results, Arup provided roadway engineering and cost-estimating technical advice to best support ten priorities for neighborhood highway cover solutions. To ensure the hard work of community input into transportation planning is honored, city, regional, and state transportation public officials must be engaged. Additionally, to holistically plan for desired community outcomes, involvement must expand to incorporate relevant departments such as housing and economic development agencies in addition to traditional transportation departments. This enables cross-sectors to leverage potential synergies, capture benefits, and maximize positive impact. To understand how past, present, and proposed systems might contribute to racial inequality and to guide decision-making, some federal, state, and local agencies are beginning to conduct racial equity impact studies. These governance frameworks provide guidelines for new development to include minority-owned business development, job creation and workforce enrichment, homeownership programs, wealth building initiatives, and cultural and community legacy initiatives. Salesforce Transit Center, San Francisco: Arup’s engineering and operations support advanced a holistic redesign to build a compact but more functional bus facility and future train station. As a result, 11 acres of downtown property was available for reuse, which allowed for the creation of an entirely new neighborhood, provided the site of the tallest building in downtown San Francisco, and also contributed more than $700 million in direct real estate sales to the project. Making improvements a reality Embracing community priorities, a holistic approach to urban regeneration can enable visionary solutions that are technically, financially, and practically feasible. Financing can be augmented by land value capture from removed or covered highway segments, as with the recessed interstate concept for an interstate section in downtown Indianapolis. A freed up 10 million square feet of developable land can potentially generate more than $2 billion in real estate investment and at least $55 million a year in additional property tax revenue. Traffic studies serve to reassess status quo approaches, opening up new solutions for enhanced vehicular flow while unlocking development potential and public health benefits. Through such an analysis, Arup determined that the planned costly tunneled section of I-5 in Portland’s Rose Quarter could be reduced in width to both reduce project costs and allow for improved development potential on and adjacent to the highway covers, while still accommodating projected traffic demand. Indianapolis, Indiana, Downtown Loop Study: Arup’s study for redeveloping I-65/I-70 in Indianapolis’s downtown transforms the roadway to address environmental justice challenges while allowing for significant land value capture. Image courtesy of ReThink Coalition. Our interstate system is still vital for transportation and goods movement between our cities and states. However, how highways interface with the human environment requires us to reevaluate its purpose and function within cities. The questions we should be asking ourselves as we reinvest in highway infrastructure include: What role should the urban sections of interstate highways perform today? Where are opportunities to tunnel, cover, cap, or redirect vehicle traffic away from people? How can last-mile deliveries be made by more sustainable modes? We need to reconceive how our cities’ roadways could and should work with an entirely new set of priorities that address historical harms, lower emissions, create healthier cities, and foster economic development, all while designing for the future of transit."

34,"National agenda, local opportunity: how should places 'level up'?",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/national-agenda-local-opportunity-how-should-places-level-up,,"As the UK government’s focus returns to domestic priorities, the administration’s levelling-up agenda appears to be both gaining definition and gathering momentum. Indeed, the policy is being talked-up in Whitehall as the central benchmark for how the government wishes to be judged. For places that have long dealt with structural challenges, like falling tourism or the loss of manufacturing or industrial employment, there is hope that this is finally an opportunity for these towns to find a new role, in an increasingly competitive global economy. An understandable first question facing local government leaders and metro Mayors, is how best to prepare, participate and benefit. In the last decade different administrations have launched a variety of funds – there is the Housing Infrastructure Fund, Future High Streets Fund, Towns Fund, Transforming Cities Fund and, most recently, the Levelling Up Fund itself. There has also been a raft of ‘deals’ – aimed at growth, devolution, sectors, freeports, cities and towns. To navigate this complex landscape, and drawing on our recent experience working with local leaders as part of England’s Towns Fund, we have identified three vital, initial phases to a successful programme: discover, organise, and plan. 1 – Discover: look locally and beyond Of course, every place faces different issues. Ramsgate has different needs to Rotherham. So it’s important to take a rigorous and tailored approach which will help leaders to define clear objectives and meet the varied challenges of, for example, decarbonisation and post-Covid recovery. To bring focus, it’s helpful to hone in on three or four really resonant local issues, and relevant metrics, as you begin to build your case for investment. But how do you do this properly? Listening to local leaders is key. In our work to make the case for the East Midlands Development Corporation, leaders told us that any new local growth had to produce opportunities for all. Our baseline study reinforced this need, finding that as many as a quarter of jobs in some local areas were vulnerable to automation, highlighting a pressing need to secure long-term jobs and skills for local people. This priority became the driving force behind subsequent work. You also need to understand the wider policy landscape and increasingly this means thinking at different scales. For instance, the government clearly wants its levelling-up agenda to dovetail with its national net zero carbon ambitions. That will favour certain interventions and may rule others out. At the most local scale, any plan still has to work within local planning priorities, business need and community preferences. In reality these are useful constraints; they help bring definition and rigour to the vision stage that will be at the base of any successful programme. Think big, think different, but think local at the same time. Helpfully, much of the insight that local leaders need already exists in the community – it’s just a case of reaching out and engaging in an effective way. This is hugely challenging during a pandemic, so new approaches have had to be developed rapidly, such as our virtual consultation rooms for Grimsby, which helped to bring a new dimension to community engagement. Effective engagement will not only ensure you bring people with you during will what will be a long journey, but taking a human-centred approach to the design of interventions provides a valuable way of deciding between what is likely to be a long local wish-list of projects. 2 – Organise: finding the right collaborators Clearly, the right mix of contributors and viewpoints is key. Existing initiatives like the Towns Fund require places to set up boards. Our experience in working with the Fund’s 101 towns suggests the partnerships between the private and public sector with community stakeholders have added a richness to towns’ visions and will support the development and delivery of transformational projects. Other places shouldn’t wait to see whether similar structures will be put in place as part of the levelling up agenda. Instead, it’s important to recognise that you need a mix of community, public, commercial and academic voices to shape the opportunity in a grounded way. High street regeneration projects tend to be most successful when a major anchor tenant is involved from the outset, both providing insight and providing a halo effect to attract new commercial partners, this pattern is replicated in the creation of innovation with collaboration between larger and smaller businesses. Getting those people round the table is one thing; getting the best out of them is the real challenge. For many of the most important players, initiatives like Town Fund will sit outside the day job. This makes their roles no less critical, but does mean there need to be clear expectations around ways of working, particularly for commercial partners. Local MPs are another important partner, and increasingly act as interpreters of central government’s funding agenda and preferences. With the right balance of people, competencies and goals, you can move forward. The places that have organised best have done it early. Trafford Council, for example, established an effective commercial partnership and made critical land acquisitions to start the process of revitalising Stretford town centre. This meant that when the Future High Streets Fund came along, the Council was already in prime position to submit a strong proposal which, with Arup’s support, was successful in securing £18m for enabling infrastructure works. 3 – Planning: an inspiring (and achievable) vision The next and biggest step, is to define the vision. All of the actual planning must be rooted in and flow from an agreed, practical yet inspiring shared vision. The vision scopes out all your interventions, it prioritises and sequences them, preparing you for the delivery phase, bringing stakeholders along for the ride, allowing projects to be owned by the ecosystem in which they sit. A well-articulated vision provides a bedrock under the programme, and it will help leaders to stay focused on the outcomes a place truly needs. It’s important to think hard and critically about the long list of interventions the vision phase generates – don’t make the perfect the enemy of the good, as the saying goes. Earlier analytical work will have established which ideas hold most value. Of course, the politics of this process have to be managed. Certain stakeholders will have long-held project goals, but it’s important not to water down the vision. A central principle should be ‘does this intervention cohere with what we know about the way people live and work?’ Indeed, the strength of your case with central government might depend on demonstration of that breadth of benefit and social value. Two examples among our work are instructive. First, Meridian Water in north London, where Enfield Council defined their vision with the required clarity: they wanted to deliver a new London district comprising 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs. The Council took an active role in delivering a new mainline station, recently opened, and acquiring strategic sites. This meant it was primed for investment from the Housing Infrastructure Fund, which with Arup support it duly secured to the tune of £156m. Second, Grimsby, where our work as part of the Towns Fund programme helped shape a town centre vision and masterplan. This provided a ‘guiding mind’ against which individual projects were identified and developed, ensuring measures related strongly to the specific funding opportunities and the outcomes being sought. Two very different places – but the same message of staying true to a strong vision. Whatever else you do, start now Amid all the unanswered questions surrounding the levelling-up agenda, one thing is clear: don’t wait. The scale of the opportunity is becoming clearer daily; being ready, organised and integrated with potential partners will lead to local advantage. For everyone involved there is an opportunity to transform ‘levelling up’ from a hopeful slogan into workable plans for much-needed change. _ Article written by Jack Stevens and Zach Wilcox Find out more Article Three ways to build back better in 2021 In the UK there is a clear political commitment to accelerate growth and increase opportunity beyond London and the South East.

35,Three steps for accelerating decarbonisation of road transport ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/three-steps-for-accelerating-decarbonisation-of-road-transport,,"Escaping the slow lane Road transport is one of the world’s biggest carbon emission challenges – it’s a sector with emissions that just keep on growing. After years of talking about sustainable transport, the time for decarbonising road transport has finally come. The EU has committed to becoming climate neutral by 2050 through the European Green Deal, which includes action to roll out cleaner, cheaper and healthier forms of transport and cities like Paris and Milan are competing to become the next Amsterdam and Copenhagen – places where cycling is the transport mode of choice. In the UK, last year’s announcement by central government that it will end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 has focused minds. The question remains: what will make the greatest and fastest difference? Here are three things that are top of our ‘do now’ list for transport decarbonisation: 1. Reinforce local power distribution systems For the first time in most geographies, local energy distributors face a major new customer type on a rapid growth trajectory: light vehicles. Most of our cars, vans and small trucks will be electric in the blink of an eye. This is the part of our road transport fleet that currently contributes the majority of road transport emissions, but not for much longer. A revolution in battery technology means that electric has 'won' the race over hydrogen for light vehicles, with market-dominant gains in battery density the deciding factor. At the same time, the buying public’s electric vehicle anxiety about battery range is fading and EVs’ market desirability is high and climbing further. All this means that the capacity and reliability of local power distribution systems matter in a way they never have. The private EV user who has access to at-home charging will increasingly – and unwittingly – pose a profound challenge for local electricity distributors. We estimate that if up to four in ten houses use EVs on a typical UK housing estate, and if they plug in at similar times after work, local electricity substations will reach capacity some of the time. This won't be the case everywhere, but we need to confront this risk now and act: business-as-usual local power distribution risks throttling our dreams of a rapid EV transition. Data-driven charging solutions that stagger the timing of vehicles 'taking the charge' can work around this demand issue, but only if we install such ‘smart’ systems now. Policymakers please take note – the market is unlikely to solve this one without being told to do so. Given how little time we have to transition light vehicles from fossil fuels to electric, it’s time to get our governance right. Who is responsible for which element of the EV transition and how can we prevent problems that have the potential to choke progress? For example, in many areas there is a ‘first come, first served’ policy from authorities as they respond to requests for connecting EV charging infrastructure. If you are the unlucky commercial customer who pushes local electricity demand above what the existing power infrastructure can cope with your connection costs suddenly include the upgrade of a local electricity substation. This approach effectively kills connection applications in specific locations, often for years. This exact policy failure undermined the onshore wind industry in many nations and regions, creating no-go zones for new wind development – it’s vital we don’t repeat this mistake with EVs. 2. Provide equitable EV charging access 2. Provide equitable EV charging access One of the biggest issues facing our local governments is how to provide access to EV charging for those who can’t charge at off-street at home. Around 30% of UK households are without access to off-street parking, with this problem affecting households of all socio-economic backgrounds. Public authorities and planners are unsure how to provide safe, reliable, affordable EV charging provision to all – and even more so in understanding what their responsibilities are. Are they the enabler, the owner, or the maintainer of this infrastructure? We urgently need clear national guidelines on the provision of EV charging infrastructure, clarity about the role each part of the supply chain will play, and new funding mechanisms to accelerate installation of EV infrastructure in areas we know will need it but where the market won’t provide. We will face a slower than necessary EV transition, unequal access to EV charging, and higher costs if the right national policies and funding don’t emerge quickly.

Take a closer look at hydrogen for heavier vehicles There are countless debates about the ‘right’ way to decarbonise transport. One focuses on the ‘best’ technology for decarbonising heavy vehicles. Solutions include hydrogen, battery, and even catenary systems - reminiscent of old trolly buses. Arguably, hydrogen shows the most promise. Production distribution costs are still high but will drop with efficiencies, and some governments have recognised that a viable hydrogen economy requires a healthy number of customers. In the UK, Industrial Cluster Funding for hydrogen is focussing on coastal areas like – Teeside, Humberside and Merseyside – with public and private money combined to support large-scale hydrogen production. The combination of low-carbon hydrogen production and transport is clearly becoming a technically and commercially viable proposition across the world. So what is stopping faster progress to develop an affordable green hydrogen product? Investors and equipment manufacturers are keen to realise the potential, but what’s clear is that the market can only do so much – and carry so much risk – on its own. This is a market that only becomes commercially viable once it has a stable of established, paying customers. This means that any nation or block of nations that wants hydrogen to be the future fuel for heavy vehicles will need to commit in the shape of clear policies and substantial public investment to pump prime and de-risk early private investment. Government support is also needed to set up scalable, future-looking value chains that allow for robust routes to market for investors. For example, identifying locations to develop dedicated hydrogen corridors where heavy vehicle routes are abundant. Regardless of how vehicles are powered, traffic congestion, severance and road safety are some of the biggest drags on productivity, placemaking and wellbeing in our cities. In many places we don’t need more motorised vehicles, we need smaller, lighter and ultimately fewer vehicles. Clearly, low emission vehicles are only part of the answer and strategies to help people travel less, to travel safely and conveniently by active modes such as walking and cycling, or by public mass transit are equally as crucial. We must find ways of decarbonising transport while keeping focus on improving air quality and creating cities where people can thrive.

36,Large compartment fire experiments: expanding knowledge of building safely with timber,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/large-compartment-fire-experiments-expanding-knowledge-of-building-safely-with-timber,,"This article was amended on the 7 June 2021 to reflect the inclusion of a second experiment. The environmental impact of construction is unsustainable in our warming world. Faced with the high carbon footprint of concrete and steel production, timber is becoming a compelling third option. Properly managed over its lifecycle, timber is a natural way to lock up carbon and unlock sustainable design. But as architects and engineers explore the speed, quality and human appeal of this sustainable material for larger and taller structures, fire safety standards and codes are yet to evolve to support low embodied carbon structures. We are contributing to the growing body of knowledge by testing the fire performance of timber and sharing our insights as we all work to develop a safe, low-carbon future for buildings. Testing resilience, at scale. Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) and glulam are the most affordable, efficient and flexible form of timber used for construction. Previous fire performance tests for these materials have focussed on structures under 90m2, the equivalent of an eight-person office. If timber is to make a full contribution to sustainable design for offices, educational and residential buildings, we need to consider its performance in much larger compartments. Our fire safety team has been working at CERIB – a professional fire test facility in France – on a series of full-scale fire experiments using a 380m2 combustible compartment, with input from Hazelab at Imperial College London. That size of compartment represents an office of approximately 40 people. Two experiments have now taken place, with the first occurring on 10 March and the second occurring on the 1 June. For both we were joined at CERIB by observers from the French Fire Prevention department and the Paris Fire Brigade. Based on previous large scale compartment experiments led by Imperial College, we designed our purpose-built test structure using masonry walls, an exposed 5-ply CLT ceiling and exposed glulam columns to mirror the aesthetic of modern timber office buildings. Early observations from the experiments To study how fires grow and develop in these larger spaces formed with exposed mass timber, we incorporated extensive instrumentation to measure temperatures and heat flux inside the building and within the CLT and glulam columns themselves. Together with cameras, this allowed us to monitor and measure fire spread, speed, duration and – with no firefighting intervention – the longterm fire decay and smouldering behaviour of CLT. The spread of fire across the exposed CLT ceiling was faster than current estimates would predict, an important insight for the design of evacuation options and fire-fighting response. Once the fuel in cribs on the floor had been consumed and only glowing embers remained, the flaming combustion on the surface of the CLT panels also reduced, though small pockets continued to smoulder for a significant number of hours. We are using these results to drive our numerical modelling of the fire behaviour of exposed timber. The use of a combustible CLT ceiling resulted in substantial external flame extension from the openings, something we will continue to study in our future experiments. Shared insight With the two experiments now completed and results yet to be peer reviewed, we are looking to this work to inform future evacuation, structural design and fire-fighting planning. The design of the building at CERIB will allow us to vary both fuel load and ventilation to more fully understand how timber performs in a fire as we deconstruct, rebuild and re-instrument the structure. Properly understood and incorporated into new codes, we hope this work will contribute to the robust use of sustainable mass timber in buildings around the world.

37,The future of mobility: Urban air,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-future-of-mobility-urban-air,,"Just as ride-sharing services transformed our transportation behaviors, advanced aerial mobility and urban air mobility (UAM) have the potential to reshape the future of our cities and the way we move through them. While helicopters have been in full-scale production since the 1940s, their widespread adoption as a scaled form of transportation has been limited by noise, cost, safety, and security considerations. Significant investment in new vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft technology to reduce noise and enhance safety and automation could result in UAM infrastructure moving people and goods at scale through our urban and regional environments within the next several years. As new aircraft solutions are developed; quieter, electric-powered vehicles come into service; and operators and developers start laying the foundation for a network of vertiports, cities must start defining their role and relationship to this new transportation modality before it’s too late. We brought together Arup’s transportation, urban planning, aviation, and acoustics experts to discuss how cities can prepare for a future UAM system that’s not only functional, but also flexible, equitable, and socially and environmentally responsible. Roundtable participants: Ryan Biziorek | Associate Principal, Acoustic, Audiovisual, and Theatre Consulting Leader in Chicago Nina Harvey | Former Senior Transportation and Urban Planner in Los Angeles Paul Moore | Principal, Consulting Practice Leader in Los Angeles Byron Thurber | Associate Principal, Aviation Leader in San Francisco Elizabeth Valmont | Associate Principal, Acoustic, Audiovisual, and Theatre Consulting Leader in Los Angeles What pitfalls are we facing if we don’t get ahead of UAM in terms of planning? Paul Moore: There are several pitfalls that need to be accounted for: noise effects, safety, congestion, community impact near vertiports, the carbon footprint of the current technology, and social equity issues around who has access to this form of transportation. Nina Harvey: Another key issue stems from flight paths. Existing helicopter flight paths, for instance, are often in line with freeways. That means all the communities already burdened by noise and air pollution might be faced with further impacts unless we create policies designed with equity and accessibility in mind now. LA traffic What are the opportunities? Byron Thurber: One obvious benefit is that urban air travel could be a much faster way to get across the city. While I don’t think the volume of UAM flights would be enough to make a dent in chronic road congestion, it will be a fun, quick way to get across town if you’re willing to pay a bit more. Economies of scale with three or four riders per trip should make the pricing not too unreasonable. Ryan Biziorek: Beyond transportation, we could also see increased access in terms of goods and services. In the United States, there are over 5,000 general aviation airports that serve as economic drivers for their communities. In locations where you may have limited express delivery options, the infrastructure to support advanced aerial mobility services is already in place. In urban environments, vertiports and drone ports can serve a similar function to help get your package delivered in a timely manner and reduce the congestion created by commercial vehicles. I actually think these types of use cases will be the backbone of any urban air network, more so than passenger air travel. Paul: We’re currently working with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) to help map out an urban air mobility framework, and for LA in particular, we want to find ways where UAM doesn’t just have to be a splurge, but a mode that serves different sectors of the community, not just those who can pay. Shared-vehicle services like Uber and Lyft, if left to their own market devices, would congregate in areas that have more disposable income. To get service throughout a city, city authorities make agreements with those companies to provide service where they might not otherwise. That’s something cities are starting to think about with UAM as well. Thinking holistically, air mobility infrastructure could offer other benefits to the community at large. For example, if you’re building a new vertiport, you could include scooter stations or make upgrades to the transit facilities in the area — things that benefit the community whether they’re using the vertiport itself or not. A lot of these ideas are incumbent upon cities getting out ahead of the private sector to make sure everything is considered systematically. Arup's SoundLab in Los Angeles What are some of the key considerations for Los Angeles’s urban air mobility framework? Elizabeth Valmont: At a high level, Los Angeles is looking to get ahead of what they know is coming so that they can respond to these issues of safety, security, equity, and liability. On top of that, we were able to give them an “aha” moment for how urban air mobility in the city will sound. Through our SoundLab, we’re able to auralize scenarios for our stakeholders, which gives them more context and a more immersive understanding of how we can design for our future. Byron: The ownership structure is another consideration. What role does Los Angeles, or any city, want to play in urban air mobility? For instance, if the private sector builds, owns, and operates vertiports, the city will need a policy for where they can and can’t be sited and their minimum proximity. If, on the other hand, the city develops vertiport infrastructure, it would follow along the lines of airports: a civic-owned piece of infrastructure that rents space and time to various airlines who operate the vehicles. Or it could be a hybrid model, like Amtrak or Greyhound, where a private company is partially subsidized by government as part of its transportation infrastructure. Paul: Another issue is that every city and every state has its own environmental permitting regulations and its own state guidance around current air mobility technologies. It’s crucial to get a grasp of any given regulatory frameworks to (a) take advantage of thinking that's already been done and (b) ensure that the city isn't getting crosswise with guidance they’re not aware of. Rendering of a vertiport © Pickard Chilton + Arup Nina: Building on that, any framework for urban air mobility that we develop now has to be flexible. The technology is changing rapidly, and we can’t be sure what it’s going to look like. So, any policy starting point has to be adaptable, whether in terms of noise impacts, vertiport uses, or flights paths. As aircrafts get quieter and more efficient, the vertiport safety radius might change or the design may be more streamlined. Public entities will need the flexibility to make those changes as the technology develops. What auralizations were we able to demo in the SoundLab? Elizabeth: For Los Angeles, we captured the sound and visuals of both an urban area and a suburban setting in the San Fernando Valley. Then we overlaid both scenarios with three simulated aircraft flyovers: a helicopter, which everyone is familiar with; a multicopter, or a passenger urban air vehicle, which we simulated as best we could; and then a small delivery drone. It’s incredibly helpful for us and our clients and partners to be able to connect the sounds to what we’re seeing. It sounds simple, but for something that doesn’t yet exist, it’s powerful to be able to demonstrate what the future of urban air will sound like. Byron: For me, I found I didn’t hear the vehicles as much as I thought I would. As a street-level observer, hearing something 150 to 200 feet up in the air blends in with the background noise of a busy LA street. The SoundLab demos have shown us that, yes, you will hear these vehicles, but you’ll get used to it as part of the urban soundscape. Nina: I noticed that the quality of the sound or the tone is very different from what a helicopter, airplane, or car sounds like. In places where there isn’t a lot of background, you will notice it more. But auralizing the sound in different settings can show more residents what the technology will sound like to them. Aerial view of Los Angeles What are the main planning and policy considerations that each city or space needs to think about? Nina: There’s a long list that, I think, starts with safety. How will the vehicles take off and land? What does the area around a vertiport look like, and what types of activities can be there? What paths must be clear to avoid any incidents? How tall can structures around vertiports be? Paul: Capacity and congestion are also key. In the early part of the last century, when people started buying cars, it didn't occur to anyone that there'd be so many cars that the system would just break down. I think, particularly as drone technology advances and the cost of labor to operate these vehicles goes down, there's going to be a really low barrier for people to put delivery drones up in the air and start filling up the airspace. So as a city, you need to think about how you intend to allocate that airspace between delivery, medical, and passenger movement. Ryan: In terms of the noise considerations, the Federal Aviation Administration recently released the Neighborhood Environmental Survey. The study evaluated the level of annoyance related to aircraft noise, and its findings suggest that our annoyance threshold is very different now than it was 20 or 30 years ago. So, we can’t rely on practices that have been used for the past 20 or 30 years. Looking ahead, understanding those thresholds and using additional noise metrics will be an important component for planning and policy. Elizabeth: For Los Angeles’s policy framework, we offered some research on disturbance and noise classifications. And as Ryan says, some of the existing community noise metrics may need to be reconsidered. Our suggestions accounted for a different future classification that speaks more to the physics of sound from the flight paths and the source, as well as the disturbance impacts on human behavior. What excites or interests you about continuing to work in the urban air mobility space? Paul: I'm personally always concerned about technology that may only be accessible to the wealthy and whose impacts fall on people who aren't benefiting from the system. Working with LADOT has been an exciting opportunity to examine the equity issues at play and find a way to make this technology part of a bigger, holistically functioning system that could benefit the many. Elizabeth: I agree with Paul. We have an opportunity to shape the technology, the buildings, our cities, and people’s lives by examining the impact at every layer. For LA specifically, there’s a lot ahead from the Olympics to the Super Bowl to the World Cup. With traffic and congestion already a concern, developers and designers are already thinking about how we can integrate this new system and new mobility modality. If well designed and well considered, what is the blue-sky potential of urban air mobility down the road? Byron: To me, it all leads back to the user experience. Who are we designing for? How will urban air mobility improve their lives? For many people, being able to get across town to an airport or sporting event from a nearby heliport is a huge benefit, though it costs more than a cab ride. If an urban air mobility system is successful and you can fit four people in a vehicle, then the cost comes down. And the more people use it, the lower the cost, due to economies of scale. Plus, if the vehicles are electric, that lowers our carbon footprint, assuming the electric power is sustainably sourced. Defibrillator delivery via drone Paul: I also see blue-sky potential through the lens of COVID. With autonomous delivery, there have been some pilot programs delivering personal protective equipment or prescriptions to senior communities in Florida to minimize face-to-face contact. If we think that, going forward, there will be other pandemics and other instances where face-to-face contact is a threat, autonomous urban air tech could be hugely beneficial. Nina: When I think about the use cases, I can't stop thinking about all of the ambulances that I've seen stuck in traffic in New York City. There's no space to go. No one's getting out of your way. How many people are impacted on a daily basis because there’s no other way to quickly get to and from a hospital around the city? An urban air solution could be pretty amazing. Ryan: In the long term, I think that UAM could enhance equity in many ways. The cost of infrastructure for ground transportation is significant. If we can responsibly design the UAM ecosystem to mitigate noise, enhance safety, and provide equitable access with partnerships between public and private sector, imagine how budgets could be rebalanced to improve other elements of the communities we live in."
38,Tones of the city: creating urban spaces that evoke the senses and energise cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/tones-of-the-city-creating-urban-spaces-that-evoke-the-senses-and-energise-cities,,"Cities cater for millions of people, engaging in diverse activities, for the 24 hours of every day. As cities grow, and precincts are regenerated, the challenges to meet the changing needs and expectations of people – residents, businesses and visitors – become more complex. Public spaces also have to address safety and security threats, to enhance safety – and perceived safety – to not only maximise but encourage the use of the space by all members of the public. What’s the ideal? Well-loved places are inclusive environments in which people not only feel safe, but can engage with others, feel part of a community, and relax and be inspired. They foster a strong sense of belonging which in turn, can help strengthen a city’s resilience and vibrancy. Designing urban spaces for people to share goes beyond practical considerations; it’s about creating those experiences which bring them alive and attract people, energising wider city precincts and ultimately cities themselves. As ‘urban living rooms’, they are dynamic, diverse and multi-functional – brought to life by the people who interact in, and with, them. The most memorable public spaces are experience-driven and evoke emotion – through sound, light, colour, texture and scent. And it’s through these multi-sensory experiences that we develop our understanding of and connections to particular places. However, the design of cities has traditionally focused solely on form, function and fairly static aesthetics. The human experience, sensory landscape, lighting, acoustics, safety and security are often only considered from a compliance perspective as part of the environmental assessment process or in the late-stage detailed design of the project. When designing public space it’s critical to involve those disciplines that design for the senses early-on. The best outcomes are shaped by integrated thinking and design, founded on an understanding of all users, uses and experiences, right from the start. Creating a space to feel safe and relaxed In creating spaces for everyone to enjoy, lighting, acoustics, safety and security design are key elements. By considering these elements in the planning and design of public spaces, small and low-cost – but context-driven – interventions can trigger more expansive and energising transformations for the local communities and businesses. ‘Lighting the urban night-time’ goes beyond providing a practical solution “to light an area”; it enhances and activates a space that can ultimately improve community and economic outcomes. How? When people do not feel safe walking at night, they are less likely to participate in outdoor activities or use public transport. Therefore, incorporating pedestrian-centric lighting interventions can enhance personal security and safety. Arup has also been working with Plan International, Monash University XYX Lab and the Committee for Sydney on research, strategies, designs and practical action plans to improve the city-life experience for women and girls. Darebin Council in Melbourne has engaged Arup’s specialists to deliver custom lighting to improve amenity and security in a village area identified by local women as unsafe. From a user’s point of view, if the lighting and design of public spaces are considered together to reduce shadows and contrasts between lit and unlit areas, the perception of safety at night improves. Lighting that is engaging and playful can also enliven the night-time atmosphere to encourage participation in the after-hours economy, maximising the use of public amenities like public transport, greenspaces and shopping and cultural precincts. 1 of 2 Pedestrian centric lighting includes a variety of layers and colours of lighting in public spaces, rather than just along the street, that encourage public to sit, dwell and relax Likewise, security design is no longer about sterile spaces with perceived fortified rings of steel or unattractive lighting. Today, we take a context-driven, multi-functional approach to security design and risk mitigation. For example, in Sydney, we are currently working with a Local Government Authority to embed safety into the design of a high-profile public space. By analysing numbers of people using the area and the site’s exposure and visibility, we are exploring a range of safety mitigation features that will be integrated into the landscape as play elements, mural walls inscribed with heritage interpretations and seating with planting that contributes to water sensitive urban design. In designing places that attract, engage and inspire people, smart acoustic design decisions are also critical. A soundscape – the acoustic environment as perceived or experienced by people in context – impacts how people hear and feel sound within a space. By incorporating music and water, for example, or planting to encourages wildlife, adds soundscapes that provide comfort and contribute to a sense of place and personal safety. However, acoustic engineering has traditionally focussed exclusively on controlling unwanted noise and acoustic effects by prioritising the potential impacts on residents of road traffic, industrial and entertainment noise. By building upon design to control unwanted ‘sound’ or noise and adopting a soundscape-centred design approach we can improve and manage the sound in our cities and civic spaces – evaluating the remaining sounds, and therefore preserving, reshaping or adding to them to create attractive, stimulating and healthy acoustic environments. 1 of 2 Pollinator friendly planting used at the Arup temporary public realm project ‘Fitzpark’ attracting attract birds, insects and other wildlife back into the urban landscape – positively contributing to the soundscape of a city space Creating a space that reflects its natural character and culture The orientation, scale and layout of the built environment also influences how a space feels and the behaviours it encourages and supports. Finishes and materials inform the tone of a place – its formality, acoustics, visual perception and character. How? Because each element works in unison to create different spaces with different purposes. Things to consider: Is it a destination space – a public place where social interactions are encouraged and supported? Is it a sheltered, private, intimate space – a quiet nook that encourages visitors to retreat and reflect? Or is it a throughfare – an in-between space for people to experience as they pass through it? What are its neighbouring spaces and uses and what kinds of urban characteristics do they share? Every space is unique and influenced by the natural and cultural character of the landscape, including the way people use and experience the space, now and through history. By integrating the surrounding terrain, land uses, views and cultural associations to public spaces, we provide multiple opportunities for users to engage their senses and interact with the space. Design decisions, such as tree and vegetation planting, coupled with water features and material selections, can provide diverse textures, colours and scents. And, they can also moderate temperatures, improve thermal comfort, and manage stormwater run-off. Impactful interventions Short-term initiatives with alignment to long-term visions for safe, enjoyable and activated urban spaces, can provide quick, cost-effective and tangible benefits for all – enabling community to contribute to the development of their future place, alongside public and private stakeholders. Community members should contribute to the development of their future place, alongside public and private stakeholders So, what are some of the short-term actions that can quickly contribute to a great ‘sense’ of place? Establish a cross government placemaking group with neighbouring Local Government Authorities, private and public stakeholders and tenants to determine quick and easy ways to improve public places. Create a vision, identify interventions, then rapidly prototype, test and iterate ideas to activate the senses. Encourage short-term social enterprise tenancies or ‘meanwhile uses’ on vacant plots or in under-utilised spaces while policy and plans are being developed These might include pop-up skate parks, a local produce market, local art installations, bicycle garaging or short-term food and beverage tenancies that help to activate spaces with a ‘sense of place’ and with enhanced personal security and safety. Install a ‘COVID safe’ parklet with modular furniture to occupy a former parking space, an area of public realm, or an unused space on an infrastructure corridor for a day, a week or six months. This will enable increased community interaction with open spaces. Prepare a pilot soundscape plan that defines the meaningful and wanted noise and acoustic effects to help activate the public space. Conduct a Lighting Vulnerability Assessment to understand the areas where people feel least safe. Use the findings to prioritise areas of human-scale lighting and activate the night-time. Illuminate bridges, sculptures, graffiti walls and natural assets, including trees, to define entry and connections to public spaces and enliven the night-time pedestrian atmosphere. Embed wayfinding to make it easy to find places where you can connect with nature and the history and culture of a place – share stories of people and events over-time, geological and landform information, bodies of water, identify local flora and fauna – to encourage visitors to engage their senses and interact with the spaces. Include ‘living labs’ to flexibly test new innovations, such as festoon lighting to trees or streets, soundscape elements and new digital technologies to enhance personal safety and security and create memorable experiences. Improve provision of high-speed wireless networks, charging points and digital displays embedded into public spaces to encourage digital-accessibility and promote a culture of opportunity and innovation. Develop a local public space wayfinding app that links points of interest and up-to-date accessibility information to raise awareness of providing inclusive, equitable and safe places 24-hours a day. The same platform could be to share temporal data on the number and types of people visiting the space, levels of activation, and longer term environmental data such as tree canopy cover, habitat diversity and climatic conditions to raise awareness of the role public realm plays in environmental performance. Publication Tactical Urbanism In recent times we have seen governments and communities reshaping street and road space to create more space for people to walk, cycle, live and play safely. But how can we lock-in some of this recent short-term change, to achieve longer-term gain? Our paper ‘Tactical Urbanism’ examines six key things to get right, to make sure tactical urbanism installations can effectively move from temporary concepts to permanent solutions. 1 July 2020 Publication Cities Alive: Rethinking the Shades of Night"
39,How cities can embrace nature and meet their net zero goals ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-cities-can-embrace-nature-and-meet-their-net-zero-goals,,"Planting a great idea Ever since Le Corbusier, many commentators have observed that cities are ‘machines for living in’. Extending the metaphor a little, we can all see how those machines have become profligate consumers of energy and emitters of CO2. As populations urbanise and cities densify, heat increases and with it the demand for air conditioning and thus production of emissions – a highly un-virtuous circle. Beyond some visionary (and expensive) new ‘BREEAM-rated outstanding’ buildings we see in a few places, the real challenge is how to make thousands of older, existing buildings more sustainable. The scale and extensive efforts often require technical retrofitting solutions which need to be clever and efficient to avoid impractical solutions which could produce still more emissions, if approached with a lack of consideration. If you look at most contemporary urban buildings, their envelopes feature a lot of metal and glass, which absorb and store energy from the sun all day, before releasing it out into the city after dark. When these buildings are in proximity they contribute to a microclimate that concentrates this heat, causing more reliance on energy hungry cooling and air conditioning systems. This leads to a situation where the temperature is artificially increased by 10-15 degrees above a building, and cities facing heat island effects that render areas increasingly unbearable with the temperature extremes produced by climate change. Watch: In collaboration with Mashable, Rudi discusses the relationship between nature and architecture in order to create a more sustainable city. To view this video, you must enable cookies. 20%… is bigger than you think All over the world city leaders are beginning to realise that greening our cities is one of the most effective, practical and realistic ways of reversing these trends, greatly improving the liveability of our urban environment and meeting net zero goals. It all starts with a simple piece of maths, something I call the 20% rule. Imagine you could bring nature to just one face of a building – a fifth of its total surface area – with plants allowed to grow on its envelope. You gain some immediate benefits at relatively low cost: the plants shade the building, lowering the need for cooling in the city and thus for the building. The substrate for the plants absorbs noise and the plants also clean the air of fine dust and particulates. It doesn’t stop there: green envelopes also reduce the effects of stronger rainfall (a growing climate change effect) meaning less occurrence of city flooding. And as we all know, human beings love being around greenery – it lowers stress and is fantastic for our mental health. Now imagine that you could apply this natural solution to 20% of the buildings in an entire city. We modelled the benefits in a number of different locations and the potential improvements are quite startling. In London we calculate that green envelopes would lower the air temperature by 3 degrees, in Berlin by 4 degrees, in Melbourne it’s 10 degrees and in the super dense environment of Hong Kong, an 11 degree drop is predicted by means of simulations. So, is this green vision practical? Watch: Greening the exteriors of existing buildings is a cost-effective way to reduce urban emissions To view this video, you must enable cookies. A natural design ethos Earlier generations of green envelopes have been criticised for being expensive or impractical to maintain, but the design ethos has matured and evolved. Our approach follows a few simple principles: it must be easy to maintain, easy to apply to a wide range of existing buildings, able to let nature do its thing without too much human intervention, taking our inspiration from the nature that thrives on cliffs. The systems we have prototyped, and currently on show at the Einfach Grün (Greening the city) exhibition at the Deutsche Architektur Museum in Frankfurt, are an intentionally affordable solution. By producing an extensive elevation system for plants, the maintenance costs for irrigation, fertilisation and drainage can to a large extent be eliminated. 1 of 2 Designing for nature: images from the DAM exhibition The green meme is coming I believe that this approach to greening and cooling the city has the potential to grow like a meme – such is the inherent appeal of greenery and nature, especially in rapidly and over-developed cities. City politicians have a valuable role to play here, as leaders and example-setters who control large amounts of urban real estate. In fact, Melbourne is already exploring how to make this a requirement on 20% of its buildings; Stuttgart is demanding it for 30% of its public stock; and Frankfurt is also investigating the potential. Ultimately, the battle against climate change cannot be won by simply bringing additional, new technology to bear on problems created by other existing technology. Greening our cities is a powerful reminder that if we learn from nature, we can develop passive, energy-neutral solutions, improve the urban experience and tackle a worldwide emergency – all at once.

40,3 ways Southeast Asian cities can use active mobility to bounce forward,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/3-ways-southeast-asian-cities-can-use-active-mobility-to-bounce-forward,,"The COVID-19 pandemic gave Southeast Asian cities a glimpse into a more liveable future, as lockdowns cleared skies and brought a rare respite from gridlock and pollutants. Some cities went further, leveraging the lack of road traffic to experiment with car-lite concepts such as turning roads into bicycle lanes. Beyond enabling commuters to walk, cycle or travel using their personal mobility devices, I believe that active mobility is a necessary paradigm shift for cities in the post-pandemic era. Here are three ways that I think Southeast Asian cities can get on track for a brighter post-pandemic future. Do more with less – explore tactical urbanism Cities can start small with tactical urbanism initiatives. This involves changing existing places and city systems through low-cost, temporary community projects to bring positive social and economic outcomes. The current low-traffic pandemic environment is the perfect time to do this, and change attitudes and behaviours towards active mobility. Although heat and humidity are oft-cited reasons in Southeast Asia for not walking more, I led a walkability study that found that Kuala Lumpur and Singapore have dramatically different levels of acceptance to walking. Interventions to pedestrian infrastructure and street design make all the difference in influencing perceptions of walking. The Jakarta ‘Safe Routes’ project is a good example. Government agencies, public institutions and local residents collaborated on a temporary road intervention. They painted a pedestrian path on shared streets to improve safety and accessibility for pedestrians to get to school, home and a mass transit station. This low-cost pilot successfully changed behaviours – traffic was calmer and 98% of students who walked from their home used the painted path. There are opportunities to pilot new initiatives and build on existing ones. Jakarta has begun remediating its interwoven canals, which can be turned into active mobility corridors that stitch together disparate neighbourhoods and forge valuable inter-community networks. Ho Chi Minh City could better leverage the transformation of the district in Thao Dien. In 2012 it turned a disused open area into a vibrant arts and entertainment venue, enhancing the precinct’s attractiveness and walkability. Jakarta has begun remediating its interwoven canals, which can be turned into active mobility corridors that stitch together disparate neighbourhoods and forge valuable inter-community networks. Make streets, not roads – invert the pyramid City planners commonly plan roads before considering pedestrians’ and cyclists’ needs. While roads serve a purpose as corridors for movement, these wide swathes of tarmac often create severances within a city. Streets, on the other hand, have a more diverse function. These are places where social and economic activity occur and deserve priority in urban planning. By prioritising streets, we are putting people and active mobility first, and cars second. We must invert the pyramid and make more streets, not roads. By reconfiguring large sections of road space and car parking lots to be more ‘street-like’, London has demonstrated the tangible economic effects of elevating the status of pedestrians. Its investment in walking and cycling infrastructure increased retail spend by 30% and rental values by 7.5%. The economic benefits extend to higher property prices, rental yields and more employment opportunities. Going beyond a people-first approach, Arup’s research has shown that a child-centric approach to urban planning can have highly positive outcomes. A child’s ability to get around independently and safely, play outdoors and connect with nature in an urban environment are considered strong indicators of high liveability standards. There’s better mental and physical wellbeing for citizens of all ages, too. Create neighbourhoods as ‘campuses’ The pandemic compels rethinking of mono-use districts within a city. Due to lockdowns and work-from-home arrangements, businesses in areas such as Central Business Districts have been hit hard by the prolonged decline in human and economic activity. Yet I have observed that 10-minute ‘campus-like’ neighbourhoods offering a diversity of amenities and experiences within a short walk or cycle from each other have been more resilient during the pandemic. Singapore’s Tanjong Pagar is an example of a successful 10-minute campus neighbourhood. Co-located within this vibrant and walkable district is a mix of hotels, retail and food options, public and private housing, heritage shophouses and skyscrapers – all stitched together by corridors of green spaces, interconnected footpaths and streets. There is something for everyone, and the diversity of visual and sensorial experiences make it attractive to stop, shop and walk – in turn, enhancing its resilience to the shock of the pandemic. Campus-like neighbourhoods offering a diversity of amenities and experiences within a short walk or cycle from each other have been more resilient during the pandemic. Active mobility is not just a transportation issue or a city planner’s problem. We’ve long known about the economic, social, public health and environmental resilience of precincts that prioritise active mobility. We just need to be better coordinators of different disciplines to transform our physical environment and engineer lasting economic, social and environmental change. While big infrastructural responses work from the top down, we must also start small with tactical urbanism, transcend siloes with a collaborative and ground-up community approach to understand diverse needs, and refocus on people over cars. Every crisis is an opportunity to outdo our previous successes. In this era of disruptions, let us focus not just on recovery and bouncing back, but on revolutionising and bouncing forward. Prioritising active mobility is a great place to start.

We have reached a point where simply ‘being sustainable’ in the way we live, work and consume, while keeping to current levels of rapid urbanisation and economic activity, is not going to help us avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Governments, city planners and designers need to band together in a collective and concerted effort – from the top-down and bottom-up – to rethink our design approach and work towards being restorative. One way is to “stop building more roads for cars, and start designing streets for people,” says Chintan, a seemingly slight perception change that has a huge potential for positive economic, environmental and social impacts.

42,Logistics design offers vital insights,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/logistics-design-offers-vital-insights,,"Logistics design can be a harbinger of change in the built environment. Recent trends in logistics consulting — the strategic design and management of supply chain operations, manufacturing processes, and goods transportation — signal the shifting landscape underway in laboratory, corporate campus, and higher-education design as businesses examine their spaces, staffing, and operations. With an already burgeoning movement toward adaptability and automation, the current pandemic has placed a new emphasis on how goods are delivered, how facilities are organized, and how organizations can put the right people and systems in place to keep operations moving safely, now and in the future. We recently spoke to members of Arup’s San Francisco–based logistics team, consultants Alexandra Cava and Sirisha Varigonda, and Associate Principal and logistics leader Melody Ablola, about the changing landscape of logistics design and how organizations across industries can build in future resilience. Pre-pandemic, what trends had recently emerged in logistics design? Alexandra Cava: For many research and development facilities, we’ve seen a move away from traditional lab or workspace setups in favor of more creative, flexible spaces. That often means having an open floor plan or a large floor plate to account for that adaptability. For instance, one of our manufacturing clients asked us to design an open floor plan without any permanent equipment installations. As they move through different stages of production, their space and equipment need to be able to change with them on a day-to-day basis. Plus, building in that flexibility allows room for future automation opportunities. Image courtesy of Steve Proehl Sirisha Varigonda: What stands out most prominently to me is an increased attention to efficiency and safety. Four years ago, when I was first working on the University of California, Merced, campus expansion project, we designed a shared loading dock that connected to a dining hall, several academic buildings, and a lab. Our aim was to design the circulation of the loading dock as efficiently as possible, specifically separating deliveries and waste to avoid cross circulation and potential contamination. We created a design that has separate facilities with separate circulation corridors, so that deliveries and waste can be handled efficiently with a high threshold for safety. Since working on that project, we’ve seen similar design ideas crop up on industrial lab projects with similar concerns. What environments or scenarios are best suited for automation? Melody Ablola: It depends on the different types of R&D facilities that we're looking at. Sometimes for tech environments, their research and development processes involve a larger supply chain, moving a lot of inbound and outbound products. So they might want to automate their back of house to support their larger R&D efforts. Sirisha: We’ve also found a lot of angles for automation on masterplanning projects where there are different buildings for different uses within the masterplan district. Whether there's a shared loading dock or even just a shared storage facility, we can tie these elements together across the masterplan with automation. What has changed in logistics design within the context of the pandemic? Alexandra: Many of our clients, especially those working on product development, are realizing the importance of developing operational resilience strategies. And that ties back to designing for flexibility. We’re currently working with another tech client on a huge manufacturing floor plate, which we’ve designed so that they can change out production lines for different pieces of equipment in order to meet changing demands. That’s certainly not something they were focusing on a year ago. Having a plan to be able to adapt as quickly as possible, in light of something like this current pandemic, is key. Sirisha: The pandemic is shaping our present and our future — and raising a lot of new questions. How might we change a loading dock design given its less-frequent use today? How can we maintain social distancing at the dock when it’s busy? How might we change our design for a building that will be online five to ten years from now? Again, it comes back to adaptability: adaptability in facility design, certainly, but also in vehicle scheduling and staff management. And automation comes into play here as well. We can outline dock operations so that fewer vehicles come less frequently, and we can find ways to manage staff as efficiently as possible, with the right number of people in the right places at the right time. How has your team adapted your thinking to answer the new questions the pandemic has raised? Sirisha: We certainly don’t have definitive answers right now — we’re all learning. But a lot of the ideas and questions we’re encountering now are concepts we already think about. Take, for instance, consolidation. Logistics practitioners are constantly thinking about vehicle flow and scheduling and how we can optimize deliveries. So the idea of consolidating several vehicles and the goods they deliver (mail and catering services, for example) at an offsite facility to then send fewer vehicles in for final deliveries is the type of design solution we’ve already considered and implemented. Melody: To Sirisha’s earlier point, we’re also working through visioning strategies to discuss all the possibilities of how we might be working 10 years from now. Designing for the campus of the future will likely mean a less populated campus — it’s our role to figure out what that would look like operationally. What do you consider the blue-sky potential of logistics design? Alexandra: There’s really no overstating the impact automation can have. With automated material handling equipment or robots able to deliver goods from the loading dock to their destination, you can reduce the amount of touch points within a lab or a manufacturing facility, which is more important now than ever. Sirisha: I think logistics has a huge role to play as we move towards this idea of a circular economy — encouraging the use of reusable materials and diverting other materials from the landfill. Right now, we’re brainstorming how we can use different types of technologies to inspire users to think critically about how they dispose of waste. We’re also evaluating the materials in use to find more durable and reusable options, all in an effort to decrease the amount of waste actually being generated. Alexandra: Similarly, our clients are showing a keener interest in electrifying their fleets. That’s a huge step to designing more sustainable facilities. And like Sirisha said, a large part of being a logistics consultant, especially one who is future focused, is going to be about helping clients understand their materials and waste, and how they can adapt for the future in a more sustainable way."
43,Three ways to build back better in 2021,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/three-ways-to-build-back-better-in-2021,,"After last year’s turbulence, this new year is the moment to focus on building back better. Post-pandemic economic recovery is on everyone’s minds, even as we continue to grapple with the virus and the risks it brings. In the UK there is a clear political commitment to accelerate growth and increase opportunity beyond London and the South East. Levelling-up the North of England is a top priority, and we have three calls to action for 2021. 1.	Speed: Use net zero to power recovery The UK government’s ten-point plan for a green recovery, announced in November 2020, is a both a roadmap for a sustainable future and a catalyst for growth and job creation. As a goal, net zero is broad and significant enough to be a powerful driver of the levelling-up agenda. How does net zero translate into growth in the North of England? The North already has emerging clusters of expertise in green energy and manufacturing. The North East, Tees Valley, Humber and Merseyside are building workforces skilled in offshore wind and hydrogen technology. The nuclear sector in Cumbria and Lancashire, and its supply chain, could deliver new small modular reactors. Major renewable and decarbonisation projects are proposed, such as tidal energy in the Mersey, carbon capture and storage in the Tees Valley and the Humber, expansion of district heating in Leeds, and through Manchester’s comprehensive climate change action plan. The UK’s building stock is recognised as a significant source of national carbon emissions. A decarbonisation programme for the North of England’s homes, designed to deliver deep retrofits and low-carbon heating, would require rapid and substantial job creation. A programme to strengthen the grid across the North to enable decentralised and renewable energy and electric vehicle charging would also generate new jobs for a net zero future. In addition, manufacturing of low-carbon vehicles should be encouraged – electric cars in Sunderland, lithium-ion batteries in Blyth, trains in Newton Aycliffe and Goole. 2. Value: Invest in science and tech for long-term growth The most successful places today are those that commercialise high-value products and services for export. Over time, the North of England must become home to a range of science and technology solutions that the wider world wants to use and buy. To achieve this will require sustained investment in research and development (R&D) and sound commercialisation of the best outputs. The North of England has the potential to scale-up science and technology clusters in industries such as health and life sciences, data science and fintech, creative and immersive tech, materials science and advanced manufacturing. This is both a short and a long game – the short game focuses on scaling-up existing businesses with high-value products and services that are capable of growing market share quickly, ideally in an international market. The long game is one of creating a culture and committing investment to the emergence of consecutive generations of high-value science and tech businesses. Increasing and refocusing R&D investment will be essential. Government should set out a clear plan for more R&D spending in the North and give local areas more control over public sector R&D funds. We must make the commercial pull-through to create new products, processes and jobs stronger. This is what the “D” in R&D stands for, after all. Let’s take product development seriously. We’re seeing valuable initiatives such as the Leeds City Region Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Programme (developed with MIT), the Innovate GM initiative in Manchester, and the strategy in the North of Tyne area encouraging digital innovation in sectors such as social care, sub-sea engineering, and professional services. We need government at all levels to support district innovation proposals in the North, as this is what will allow emerging industries like smart mobility, health tech and 5G to flourish. 3.	Reshape: Level up our towns and cities The North’s most economically productive places are a small number of dense city centres. Our own recent work for developers CEG demonstrates how Leeds city centre supports high concentrations of knowledge-intensive jobs. In urban development and regeneration projects, supporting growth in the knowledge economy is vital if investments are to work. Some of our recent work on the future of offices points to an increasing need for city centres to provide the right types of workspace, public realm, amenity offer and quality of life to facilitate collaboration and innovation. The North’s towns and cities need to repurpose traditional retail centres and high streets to provide less (and different) retail floorspace and a wider mix of uses, including residential, leisure, public services and workspaces. Over forty towns across the North are already being supported by the government’s Stronger Towns Fund. They are developing ambitious strategies and new partnerships for regeneration and economic growth. This work should be used as the basis for long-term, place-based plans to create new jobs, improve quality of life, and secure high-quality new development, including the right type of homes and neighbourhoods to support the modern economy. Existing government policies in this area could be extended to support a wider range of towns and act as a catalyst for new devolution deals. Better connectivity is another acknowledged, pressing need for the North. People must be able to develop their careers without moving home, while firms need to draw on a high-quality pool of potential workers and the North’s town and cities need better connectivity to generate agglomeration benefits. The Integrated Rail Plan for the North is eagerly awaited and local leaders are - rightly - making the case for the role of major rail projects in levelling up. Low-carbon connectivity schemes should be recognised as catalysts for wider regeneration. Arup’s work for Bradford Council demonstrates how Northern Powerhouse Rail could transform the role and shape of the city centre, one with a young and rapidly growing population of over half a million. Smaller connectivity schemes, including new active travel infrastructure, would also unlock new job opportunities, development sites, and support regeneration. Publications Transformative Rail: The issues shaping the future of the industry Low-carbon connectivity schemes should be recognised as catalysts for wider regeneration. Our publication focuses away from trends to explore the most effective ways to develop railway systems fit for today’s demand and tomorrow’s opportunities. Download Perfect timing Last year gifted us a new commitment to achieving change at pace. Long evolving trends around the digital economy, flexible working, new forms of mobility, changing leisure and retail preferences are intersecting. For the North of England, the levelling up agenda is now an opportunity to respond to these trends and to do so now, without delay.

44,Urban futures logistics: Street design and planning,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/urban-futures-logistics,,"The following article was authored by Arup Logistics Consultant Sydni Keppen. In recent months, the COVID-19 crisis has disrupted civic life in unprecedented ways, especially in America’s urban centers. The rapid transformation of the urban realm is one of the pandemic’s most visible side effects. To meet a pressing need for outdoor space, open-air retail, recreation, and dining areas have sprung up on sidewalks and along curbs once allocated for vehicles. These new amenities have played a vital role in buoying communities, but they have also constrained available space at a moment when the pandemic has driven demand for home delivery services to an all-time high, flooding urban supply routes with delivery vehicles. These changes have converged to create knotty logistical challenges for many urban centers. Cities must evolve to meet the demands of these shifting usage patterns. Partnering with holistic logistics planners can help municipal decision makers reconcile the needs of a broad range of users and develop programs and policies that support public health, maximize benefits to the community, and keep vital city supply chains robust and resilient. On-demand delivery on the rise puts pressure on streets During the early months of the pandemic, homebound residents desperate to get outside and businesses facing financial ruin if they did not reopen began clamoring for the reallocation of street space usually set aside for traffic. Soon, outdoor retail and recreation areas and so-called “streeteries” became regular features of city life. At the same time, the pandemic was driving major changes in consumer behavior. Under COVID-19, America’s already healthy appetite for on-demand delivery rose sharply. In April 2020, e-sales were nearly 50% higher than the previous April and they continued to balloon throughout May and June. Nor did the reopening of brick and mortar stores quench demand for home delivery. As e-sales began to level off in July and August, “buy online pickup in store” (BOPIS) sales picked up steam — so much so that by August 2020, year-to-year BOPIS sales were up nearly 260%. All these changes have forced city streets to absorb a more complex array of users and put new strains on the supply-chain ecosystem. Unfortunately, many of the challenges that have emerged during the pandemic are unlikely to disappear once it’s over. Consumers have historically been reluctant to abandon a convenience once they’ve grown accustomed to it. This means choices made of necessity during the pandemic, like BOPIS and home grocery delivery, are likely to become ingrained behaviors. Likewise, new distribution methods and technologies that were scaled up to feed consumer demand during the pandemic, like parcel pick-up lockers and drones, will be with us after the crisis passes. In short, the COVID-19 supply chain model is our new normal. To successfully accommodate the new paradigm in last-mile delivery in a changing urban landscape, city streets and neighborhoods will need to find effective ways to integrate a variety of moving parts and make optimal use of available space. Maximizing social and economic value In addition to triggering widespread changes in the public realm, COVID-19 has highlighted the fact that keeping city supply chains running smoothly is essential to the livelihood of both residents and businesses. To support our cities through the pandemic and beyond, it is crucial that we find ways to retain the value of new amenities, like outdoor dining and retail, while also improving the efficiency of last-mile deliveries. Doing so will not only support our economic recovery, it will also reduce congestion and the environmental impacts that come along with it. To accomplish these goals, municipal planners will need to answer a range of questions — how to reallocate curbside space to serve the public and support service and delivery operations, how to accommodate emerging delivery methods and technologies, and how to secure supply chains while reducing environmental impacts like noise and pollution. Partnering with holistic planning experts can help cities ensure that the programs and policies they create in response to these shifting paradigms deliver maximum social and economic value while improving efficiency. Are autonomous vehicles and drone delivery the future? The thing that distinguishes holistic planning from traditional logistics is a focus on the bigger picture. Holistic logistics experts understand that cities are complex organisms and supply chains do not exist in a vacuum. They can work with cities to understand how the interaction of street design, operations, and users are impacting the efficiency of supply chains, public health and safety, and sustainability. A holistic planning approach starts with a careful study of the key issues contributing to logistics challenges. At present, that entails determining how new street uses, like curbside dining and retail, are converging with an increase in the number and type of delivery vehicles on the road, contributing to congestion and inefficiency and impacting safety and the environment. To give you just one example, the surge in online sales that has put so many more trucks on urban streets has also left them parked curbside for longer durations due the accompanying rise in returns. This has resulted in more traffic snarls on city streets. By analyzing logistics operations at the building, block, and neighborhood level, logistics experts can help municipal planners understand how various factors come together to reduce efficiency and create pain points in the system. Armed with this knowledge, logistics experts can work with decision makers to identify goals, like enhancing sustainability, supporting local businesses, and improving the integration of mobility systems, and design context-appropriate programs and policies to meet these goals. The specific mitigations recommended will vary from project to project but could, for instance, include dedicating commercial loading zones and implementing technology to allow drivers to reserve curbside space in heavily trafficked neighborhoods — a solution that helps to reduce the amount of time people spend looking for parking, decreases the incidence of double parking, and supports timely delivery pick-ups and drop-offs. Holistic logistics experts also understand that cities are continuously evolving and that today’s infrastructure and operations solutions must be designed with the future in mind. Skilled logistics planners can work with decision makers to put infrastructure and programs in place to accommodate the future rollout of autonomous vehicles or to facilitate coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration to institute drone delivery. What is a freight-friendly street design? The changes COVID-19 has triggered in the public realm have created complex challenges. To solve these challenges, cities will benefit from working with experts who have a thorough understanding of best practices and the ability to devise holistic strategies to meet current demands. By leveraging best practices, like freight-friendly and resilient street design; optimized delivery management and procurement programs; consolidated delivery operations; and waste management strategies, municipal planners can implement changes that enhance quality of life for residents while improving mobility and supporting commercial operations. By implementing best practices in freight-friendly street design, logistics experts can help cities find ways to incorporate new distribution trends and technologies accelerated by COVID-19 — like drones, autonomous vehicles, and parcel pick-up lockers — and take advantage of the opportunities they bring. Here’s one example: Several major companies, including Walmart, Amazon, and UPS, have been piloting the use of drones for package delivery during the pandemic. Rather than resisting or ignoring the rise of drones, cities will want to explore opportunities to use drones to support social distancing and foster the creation of new jobs. Best practices in delivery management and procurement can help city planners reduce the number of vehicles on the road at peak times. Logistics experts can also help municipal planners take advantage of consolidation opportunities to reduce the number of motorized delivery vehicles on streets and provide other benefits. For instance, to help one client reduce the number of trucks in an urban neighborhood without sacrificing efficiency, Arup recommended they centralize deliveries by establishing district logistics hub from which light-duty vehicles and bikes could be used to carry goods to their destination. Other strategies include extending off-hour delivery programs and implementing preferred vendor programs for specific commodities — a solution that helped one Arup client reduce the presence of commercial vehicles on a luxury shopping street by 70% during the day. At a moment when curb space is at a premium, it is also important for cities to limit the amount of trash on neighborhood sidewalks. Logistics experts can help cities develop waste management strategies that enhance the public realm, such as attractive on-street trash containment solutions for large business owners. Trash management can also be improved by setting aside strategically located areas for waste consolidation. The deployment of measures like these reduces the volume of waste on city sidewalks, frees up space, and limits the greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste collection. Leverage logistics to make cities healthier, more sustainable, and more resilient While the best practices outlined here have been proven to help reduce truck trips and conflicts within the public realm, their overall effectiveness hinges on the way they are deployed to meet specific challenges. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to holistic planning because each city and each neighborhood is unique. Working with skilled logistics experts who approach planning holistically can help municipal decision makers ensure that the changes COVID-19 has triggered in the public realm are transformed into positive disruptions and that cities come out of the crisis healthier, more sustainable, and more resilient."
45,Don't bet against cities: four trends shaping urban recovery,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/dont-bet-against-cities-four-trends-shaping-cities-recovery,,"This year’s lockdown experiences have challenged many assumptions about city lives. Now, as vaccines become a reality, we have an opportunity to build a new vision of the urban future, learning from this global-yet-local experience. For the majority who live in towns and cities, our lives have been transformed as we are being urged to: Work from home, as much as possible, using online and digital tools Rediscover our local town centre by bike or on foot Reduce international travel Refocus on local supply chains and promote national production Retain local jobs for local people Yet, almost without exception, all of these trends were in train before the health emergency. The response to the virus has merely magnified and accelerated them. Despite the initial fear that the pandemic meant that urbanisation would come to a halt, I believe cities are about to adapt and in beneficial ways. Beyond localism: four new trends Encouraged by their citizens, growing cities are increasingly claiming tax raising powers, taking control of transport, housing, utilities and even healthcare in some cases. It is cities, more than national governments, that have led effective policies of change. Whether it’s implementing road pricing schemes, decarbonising energy and heat networks, banning diesel or encouraging a shift to cycling, city leadership demonstrably works. The current pandemic has merely compounded these trends, engendering great pride and belonging to cities dealing with strife. I suspect ultimately, it is city leaders more than national governments that will be the ones to persuade their people back to work post-lockdown. The four factors likely to shape cities’ future development: A new urban form shaped by emerging knowledge-based economies The growing influence of technology The rise of 2nd tier cities with a local, specialist economic focus New suburban centres - a move away from the singular CBD Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Thanks to digital technology and increasingly capable networking, most developed world cities have already seen the potential of the knowledge-based economy as a creator of new jobs and rapid builder of wealth. For new entrants, these new activities are less historically dependant, meaning location or lack of size will be no barrier to the possibilities of growth of hi-tech clean manufacturing, digital and data driven services, university, research and science based urban development. Good ‘place making’ will remain critical to attracting this talent to a city. Our centres need to work even harder post-lockdown to persuade people to leave their homes and head back to the office. New district, town or city-wide relationships could emerge where business works together with the public sector to create an ‘inside-out’ reimagining of our buildings and streets, opening office and retail frontages to spill out onto enlivened public realm, pedestrian only zones and calm ecological corridors. The digital, responsive city Technology’s influence is already clear. In this digital era, city governments are already using data to better understand and target those in need, and there is great potential to adopt even more responsive data-driven policies. With vastly greater insights into both their populations and their behaviour, new methods of financing infrastructure, public services and affordable housing become possible with ‘live’ pricing of property values, road use and electronic transactions and the undergrounding and ‘live’ management of goods and services to reduce congestion. The rise of 2nd tier cities Technology offers the potential for smaller cities to develop new economic engines of their own, through specialist activities such as remote production, digital modelling, data-analytics, design, prototyping and product refinement. Often less physically congested, more affordable to live and work in, these second tier cities should prove as attractive to talent as some of the larger ‘magnet cities’ are today. Regional networks of second tier cities are already evident in Northern Europe and are now emerging strongly in China. New suburban centres Personally, I think the CBD has a strong future, but localism is clearly growing. During lockdowns my fellow Londoners have rediscovered the value and character of the city’s village-based nature, an embrace and support of local neighbourhoods that we’ve seen in many other cities worldwide. The advent of digital transactions, increased home working and electric bikes and scooters coupled with local electric delivery networks could drive a gradual shift back to this kind of multi-centre model. There’s an opportunity for greater low-cost connectivity within and between decentralised urban centres as places of work, leisure, accommodation, collaboration and trade. What’s more, with technology facilitating more adaptable buildings and spaces, a historic suburban centre can adopt many of the functions of a CBD without the need for expensive redevelopment or new infrastructure. This trend is being accelerated in the east more than the west. It is best encapsulated by the design of China’s newest City Xion’an – with its plan for multiple centres, layered underground transport networks, with people friendly streets and public realm, conveniently served by electric (and soon autonomous) vehicles. A sustainable future starts in the city After the pandemic the other main trend on the horizon is obviously climate change, the push for net zero and the need for sustainable development in all decision making. Cities will be a central context for this development. Sustainable development principles are now established into banking and investment regulation. Digital communications infrastructure, retrofitting buildings, clean energy transformation and sustainable transport are all immediately investable and excellent generators of employment. This combination of net zero ambition and the need for greater social value and jobs will be a winning combination for stimulus the world over and cities will lead the way. Far from leading to an abandonment of city life, this year has provided many new ideas about how to shape its future for the better.

46, The fifteen minute vision: Future proofing our cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-fifteen-minute-vision-future-proofing-our-cities,,"What impact will the pandemic have on the future of our cities? Only the history books will be able to say for sure. However, our job as citymakers is to ensure that cities are fit for the many different futures that they might meet. The impact of the pandemic has created an opportunity to study how people’s lives are impacted when they are forced to rely on their immediate community for many of their day-to-day needs, from entertainment to access to green space. We wanted to investigate how lockdowns and the pandemic, restricting people’s movements to their neighbourhoods, highlighted the benefits and shortcomings of those neighbourhoods and the possible consequences for future design. That’s why we’ve commissioned Arup’s City Living Barometer – a survey of 5,000 residents across five major European cities: London, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Milan. The survey used the 15-minute city concept – which argues that people enjoy a better quality of life when amenities are within 15 minutes walking or cycling distance from their home – to roughly assess the liveability of each city. The idea was originally developed by Professor Carlos Moreno at the Sorbonne and espouses a new approach to urban design. “ We wanted to investigate how lockdowns and the pandemic, restricting people’s movements to their neighbourhoods, highlighted the benefits and shortcomings of those neighbourhoods and the possible consequences for future design. ” Malcolm Smith Director What our survey found Residents of London, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Milan were asked how far they had to travel to green space, a shop that sells groceries, a medical facility, a school, a restaurant or café, and a leisure centre or gym. To gauge people’s attitudes to city life during the pandemic we also asked if they had considered leaving their city because of the pandemic or if they moved out temporarily at any point. We found that London stood out compared to the other European cities as, on average, a 23.5-minute city. It also had by far the largest number of people (59%) who considered leaving and the highest (41%) that moved out temporarily (see table for comparison with other cities). Almost half of Londoners complained that amenities were too far away. What this means for cities For me, the results emphasised the importance of developing cities in smaller modules, with essential services around community hubs. A move towards the 15-minute city will help us hold on to the things we’ve gained temporarily – less traffic, cleaner air and, for many, more time with family. Here are my thoughts on how to move towards a 15-minute city: 1. Focusing on walkability Making the city more walkable by measures such as pedestrianizing shopping streets, planting more trees to provide shade and providing more benches and public toilets. Walking has been shown to make people happier and reduce air pollution. And a walkable neighbourhood increases the informal interactions between people, building ties among neighbours.

Greenery has an important role in making cities more resilient, both by providing residents with a respite from tarmac and concrete and offering shade, natural flood defences and cleaner air. There are many things a city can do to bring green spaces to communities. In Liverpool for example, modular parklets using street furniture and planter have provided more greenery.

It’s been shown that child-friendly cities are friendlier places for everyone. Playful encounters can be built into everyday journeys through interventions that give objects purpose beyond their primary function and foster curiosity. Examples include playful bus stops, public art projects or pocket parks such as the Urban95. Find out more: Arup Cities Alive: Designing for Urban Childhoods 4. Multifunctional space In densely packed cities like London we need to look to re-use existing or outdated infrastructure such as car parks, school grounds or community hubs for neighbourhood activities after hours. Or looking to temporarily facilities, such as Kings Cross Central in London set up during its redevelopment – including an open-air swimming pool. Find out more: Meanwhile use, long-term benefit.

Creating digital twins The ability to build online cities in parallel with our physical cities is within our reach. It allows us to model and test ideas that could ensure all developments help contribute to making urban life more enjoyable for communities by helping with everything from reducing air pollution to connecting people with green spaces. Digital twins allow the real-time simulation of cities – enabling policy makers and urban designers to test different scenarios and identify risks and opportunities. Crucially they will allow communities to understand fully the impact of different planning decisions.

47,Net zero buildings with reduced carbon impact,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/net-zero-buildings-incentivising-the-great-leap-forward,,"Net zero commitments are taking hold all over the world with organisations at the heart of the global property sector making ambitious promises to decarbonise their portfolios and achieve net zero. Achieving net zero across all existing and new property assets will be a huge challenge, but one that must be embraced. What are the steps the industry needs to take now? First, we need to define what we mean by ‘net zero carbon building’. Such a building does not necessarily have to achieve net zero energy consumption or net zero material impacts on site. For many buildings in an urban environment such objectives would be impossible to achieve. But a net zero building does need to have reduced its carbon impact to a level compatible with making a meaningful contribution to decarbonisation targets set at a sectoral, regional or national level. Our definition must include buildings’ whole lifecycle carbon impacts. That’s the total carbon emissions associated with a building’s design, construction, maintenance, repair, refurbishment and demolition as well as its energy consumption during operation. Only this complete definition will give the property sector and its leaders confidence that the net zero goals they are pursuing will genuinely contribute to decarbonisation – and protect their assets from becoming stranded. The importance of incorporating embodied carbon alongside operational carbon is easily illustrated if we think about a typical building in the UK. In this case, operational emissions from electricity and gas consumption typically make up a third to a half of many buildings’ whole lifecycle carbon impacts. We need to tackle these operational-phase emissions through good design and operations – in other words we need to minimise energy demand. We also need to offset residual operational emissions through renewable energy tariffs. But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that resolving operational emissions alone is enough to make our buildings truly net zero. Embodied carbon must be an integral element of net zero strategies for buildings – this is a central topic in our report Net Zero Carbon Buildings: Three Steps to Take Now. Publications Net zero carbon buildings: three steps to take now Achieving net zero carbon will require us to transform how we design, build and operate buildings of all types and scales. Download Accreditation and commercial incentives To turn warm words about net zero buildings into action, property owners and developers need to believe there is a workable commercial model. A clear market premium must emerge for buildings whose whole lifecycle carbon data demonstrates achievement of net zero or shows that a building has been designed and built to achieve net zero when it is operational. Here we hit a problem. Even with growing interest in net zero buildings from some occupant groups within the UK and European property market, there isn’t yet a trusted way to differentiate a net zero building of any type from the rest of the pack. So why would developers invest in net zero carbon projects and accept additional upfront costs? Getting to net zero is a complex journey, whether it’s an existing building undergoing refurbishment or a new-build. We can’t wait until the end of a building lifecycle before we reward buildings that have set themselves up to win. Rather like teams that compete in the Tour de France, we need to break the journey into stages and reward contributors along the way. Setting new standards One solution would be to find ways to accredit net zero elements of the design. In our new report, we have called this ‘net zero enabled’. This recognises a building’s design and construction data that proves it is able to achieve net zero carbon on a whole lifecycle carbon basis if, and when, it is operated effectively. Buildings would achieve ‘net zero enabled’ based on criteria set by established market ratings. In the UK, the Better Buildings Partnership’s UK NABERS scheme is a big step forward, providing a robust mechanism for assessing the operational energy performance of buildings. That leaves creation of an embodied carbon rating scheme still to be tackled. There is a lot of work to be done to clarify what percentage reduction in materials-related carbon emissions is needed to put a building on a course for net zero. How do we assess embodied carbon impact fairly and define targets consistently across different building types, markets and physical environments? These are difficult questions that urgently require technically credible and market friendly answers. An incentive that allows buildings’ embodied carbon to be compared and rated is needed. Without one how can we expect asset owners and developers to invest consistently to minimise embodied carbon? Operational carbon - the everyday commitment Delivering net zero carbon buildings is not just about design choices. Achieving net zero fully is as much about how a building is operated and occupied as how it is designed and built. How we operate our buildings is the last piece in the net zero jigsaw. Efficient operation flows from effective design, and as designers we may need to relearn the skills of design-for-operation that have eroded in the face of the compliance culture of recent years. The Australian property market has shown that transformation of the facilities management sector is possible when there is a clear incentive in place – the success of NABERS in the Australian market has led to a shift towards performance-based maintenance. A similar shift in the UK is well overdue. The property sector has a huge role to play in achieving net zero and there is encouraging evidence that the market is ready for this transition. It’s up to us to provide the tools and incentive structures to make it happen.

48,"The digital neighbourhood: your data, your neighbourhood, your solution",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-digital-neighbourhood-your-data-your-neighbourhood-your-solution,,"There’s a growing realisation that our personal data is being captured on an ever more detailed level. From when our heating goes on, to how many steps we have (or haven’t) run, to the times of day we travel to what we purchase once we arrive at our destination. To date most of this information has been held by a few major corporations, mostly for the refinement of their own services and devices, and to present us with ever more targeted advertising. But what if neighbourhoods could reclaim this data and harness it in a way that allowed them to respond to the needs of their community? The neigbourhood goes digital Right now, we generate vast quantities of data that remain largely underused in our local context. Imagine instead, being able to understand the daily impact your own home, businesses or car is having on the air quality of your local neighbourhood? Or imagine being able to understand how your local area could, with a few behavioural changes, make a meaningful contribution to net zero targets? After the experience of Covid-19, the idea of a neighbourhood has come back into focus once more – it’s the new centre of work and life for many, and local issues are moving up the agenda as a result. Urban planners are beginning to see the neighbourhoods as a powerful and effective scale to turn personal data into valuable local outcomes. A local ethos, not a technology There are many issues that local administrations need to deal with, from air quality to social mobility where an evidence-led approach is vital. However, in many of these scenarios, either the data is held by the wrong party, not collected in a way that makes it useful, or the community has reservations about how and why their data is to be used. The ‘digital neighbourhood’ approach starts with a clearly defined local issue, one that can be addressed with shared data that is mutually beneficial to the community, private companies and public sector. The digital neighbourhood is an approach to managing and using data to benefit the community; it is not an off-the-shelf product. The process fundamentally needs to be driven by and respond to the needs of the community it seeks to serve. Tackling neighbourhood problems digitally does not require generating reams of new data. The opportunity lies in collaborating to get the most from data that already exists. At its heart is a commitment to the idea that solutions must reflect what the community really needs. Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park London data goes local So, what might be achieved? We’ve been exploring the digital neighbourhood approach with the Greater London Authority and the London Data Commission at four sites across the city: Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Brent Cross South, Mayfair and Midtown Business Improvement District. Each site is very different, but they’re all aware that information (data) is often siloed and that they lack a way of integrating data to reveal new insights or plan new responses. Take local transport provision. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) wants to encourage a car-free future, and to be able to empirically demonstrate their success to encourage uptake outside the Park. Any new mobility service must be inclusive and meet real local need – in this case families on lower incomes. The development process obviously requires a deep understanding of the community and its needs. Local data like user responses to mobility trials, local spend patterns and infrastructure usage patterns, when integrated can help the shape the solution, and develop it in future. Integrating a wide range of data reveals the real neighbourhood need. We’re taking anonymised data on local spending from around the park from payment companies, and blending it with Transport for London travel data to shape potential schemes. It’s a new level of public/private collaboration driven by the specifics of real people’s lives, rather than simply the commercial aspirations of a private enterprise. This integrate-to-reveal ethos could produce other sorts of local benefits. You wake up. A quick glance at your neighbourhood data service reveals which are currently the quieter routes for your morning run. Or the system provides feedback to your local authority on how e-scooters are impacting your neighbourhood or would alert you that there is a major event going on at your local park and it is likely to interfere with your commute. Such hyper-local data services could also bring the neighbourhood together by providing information on things like new retail openings, noise and anti-social behaviour. Previously anonymous and invisible data has the potential to strengthen communities while maintaining individual privacy. Learning from each other, rebuilding together Neighbourhoods often face common issues. The ‘digital neighbourhood’ approach is a highly workable and cost-effective scale to test policies and services, before committing to replicate them across an entire city. As we recover from the biggest economic shock in a century, the ability to test policies and initiatives quickly that encourage a safe return to some of the economic activity that has been infeasible during the Covid-19 pandemic will be essential to helping our neighbourhood high-streets and businesses recover.

49,Microclimate design: Activating essential outdoor spaces,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/microclimate-design-activating-outdoor-spaces,,"The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing many US cities to reconsider the role that outdoor space plays in urban life. Most modern American cities were planned during the automotive age to prioritize car traffic, but the pandemic has helped to catalyze a fundamental transformation of the urban core. In the span of just a few months, densely populated cities, like New York, have seen residents reclaiming the streets. Utilitarian spaces once allocated for parking are now serving as vital amenities where people meet friends, cycle, and work, and restaurants and retailers serve their customers. As outdoor spaces take on a more central role in the urban ecosystem, it is increasingly important that they remain comfortable and functional for as much of the year as possible or we run the risk of losing ground and undermining our economic recovery. Many restaurants are highly dependent on the revenue generated through outdoor dining, for example. Meanwhile, the new social distancing requirements are prompting some corporate workplaces to convert outdoor spaces, like terraces and courtyards, into meeting areas, heightening the need to keep them comfortable and accessible throughout the year. Finding ways to maximize the comfort and functionality of outdoor spaces year-round is a new challenge for many cities and it is not a simple process. Microclimate consultants can help. As specialists trained to analyze the ways that the urban form interacts with the local microclimate to shape the user experience, microclimate consultants can work with urban planners, developers, and designers to identify interventions that optimize the quality and comfort of individual projects, large corporate campuses, or even entire business districts. The usability of the outdoor spaces is directly connected to its intended use. As a result of the pandemic, spaces designed for circulation are now used for dining or working. This leads to different expectations for the outdoor environment, as illustrated by the changing criteria from left to right. Microclimate design and analytics for outdoor spaces Microclimate consultants perform advanced microclimate modeling and leverage the resulting insights to develop comfort-enhancing solutions that work in harmony with a project’s overall design vision. The benefits of microclimate design are best unlocked when consultants are involved in the very early stages of design and the insights derived from the analyses and multidisciplinary thinking can be used to inform fundamental design decisions. However, the same approach is also valuable in mitigating climate-related issues that arise at later stages or to enhance the comfort of existing outdoor spaces. Microclimate design seeks to optimize the performance of both buildings and outdoor spaces in a variety of ways. For example, by analyzing the expected uses (time of day, tasks) of assets and the range of possible users (commuters, clients, employees) in conjunction with local climate conditions, the design team can ensure that projects are planned in a manner that maximizes benefit to users and makes the best use of valuable real estate. In areas prone to extreme weather, like heat waves, cold snaps, and periods of heavy rainfall, microclimate consultants can identify and deploy design solutions that improve the resilience, functionality, and safety of outdoor amenities without detracting from their overall look and feel. This is accomplished with the help of a variety of strategies, ranging from the optimization of building massing to the use of vegetation and canopies. For example, businesses and restaurants in the northeast of the United States seeking to extend the use of existing outdoor spaces through the colder months could work with microclimate consultants to improve thermal comfort. This could be achieved by integrating new landscaping elements or screens to block the wind while optimizing solar exposure and adding comfort-promoting design elements such as heated furniture. Advanced analysis techniques including solar studies and wind simulations are used to support design concepts and predict user comfort in different parts of the city. Microclimate design is more relevant today than ever before The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of outdoor space in urban life. This shift — already underway well before the pandemic — is likely here to stay, which means that projects will increasingly be judged on the merits of their outdoor environments. Treating exterior areas as an ancillary concern or an afterthought will no longer be sufficient. Microclimate consultants can help developers, designers, and urban planners maximize the value of a project by elevating and activating its exterior assets. The way they achieve this aim can differ markedly from project to project. A microclimate expert tasked with helping a neighborhood restaurant maintain outdoor operations through the fall would primarily focus on thermal performance enhancements, as discussed above. For a new build masterplan project, a microclimate expert might work with the design team to inform the orientation and building form and add building elements, such as colonnades and overhangs, to enhance the pedestrian experience. Site measurements can be used to investigate the benefits of different microclimate strategies. This picture shows the difference between an exposed environment (top) and a protected environment (bottom), where the surface temperatures are reduced due to the choice of finishing materials, landscaping, and water. Microclimate design is highly flexible and scalable Microclimate design can be used to help cities tackle many of their most pressing challenges, from small standalone projects to larger-scale improvements in the urban realm. In addition to working with business owners to design or upgrade their outdoor spaces, microclimate consultants can partner with municipal planners to help improve the comfort and safety of multimodal networks as demand for them grows. Microclimate consultants can evaluate the pedestrian and cyclist experience at individual intersections or within entire neighborhoods, identifying uncomfortable or unsafe conditions resulting from strong winds near the ground or intense solar glare. The insights they provide can aid decision makers in determining how best to streamline circulation and mobility — pinpointing the best routes for pedestrian paths, recommending mitigation measures to limit uncomfortable wind conditions, and identifying appropriate locations for covered rest areas. Big business can also benefit from collaborating with microclimate consultants on the planning and design of outdoor spaces. To attract and retain high-caliber candidates, many corporations are already working hard to signal their commitment to sustainable values in a variety of ways. Many businesses have focused on improving access to outdoor space where employees can work, meet, and exercise. This trend is likely to grow in the aftermath of COVID-19, with many people having acclimated to more flexible working conditions. Microclimate consultants can work with corporate clients to design or upgrade individual outdoor spaces or corporate campuses that support a range of planned activities, while providing adequate comfort for as much of the year as possible. Microclimate design supports the creation of comfortable outdoor environments at every stage of a project, from concept design to adaptation of existing conditions. Looking ahead toward long-term resilience We are moving into a new era where quality outdoor space will become a big differentiator in the eyes of the consumer. Microclimate design is particularly advantageous at this time when our urban landscapes are being transformed by a variety of forces that will have major impacts on the user experience. Integrating microclimate consultants into design teams can help ensure that projects of all kinds are shaped by the best available knowledge and delivered in a manner that supports user comfort, health, and long-term resilience. Those who work with microclimate consultants to make the most of their outdoor spaces now will be poised to reap the rewards in the long term."
50,"Public spaces, safety and security: boosting our wellbeing",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/public-spaces-safety-and-security-boosting-our-wellbeing,,"With more people living in cities than ever before, it is imperative that our cities support healthy populations. The coronavirus has highlighted the importance of physical activity among urban populations to reduce known comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Physical activity, safely socially distanced should be encouraged, and the design of the built environment has a role to play in facilitating physical activity in cities. Research provides consistent evidence supporting the link between pedestrian-friendly urban environments and lower levels of obesity. It also indicates a direct causation between city sprawl, which is associated with increased car use, and limited opportunities for physical activity. But, an increase in the use of active spaces in cities must also come with improved security. Addressing people’s security needs is essential in encouraging them to undertake physical exercise. We understand the need to incorporate accessible public space into our design, but how often are we considering the security that should come alongside this? “ Recent security and crime incidents in public spaces in our cities have shown the pressing need for security to be considered in the design and operation of public realm, to improve the wellbeing of users of those spaces ” Richard Bond Associate, Resilience, Security and Risk Do we feel safe enough in public spaces to exercise? Fear of violence and crime in outdoor areas is reported to be one of the most significant factors that deter people from engaging in physical activity in public spaces. Workplaces that do not have a secure space for people to store their bicycles could mean they are more likely to avoid cycling to work, even if it is a practical option. Well-connected pedestrian and cycle routes and attractive open spaces encourage people to exercise outdoors. Encouraging activity A variety of measures can improve accessibility and the quality of opportunities to be active, from the design of dedicated and well-connected pedestrian and cycle routes to the cultivation of attractive spaces to encourage people to exercise outdoors. Lighting pedestrian routes to a daylight-equivalent level can increase their usage by up to 38% compared to if left unlit. The same applies to cycle paths, and can increase their usage by as much as 62%. Such findings reiterate the role of security in reducing the fear of crime and encouraging dwell time in public spaces. People-centred security design Built environment stakeholders need to make the investment in enhancing urban environments through understanding public perception of risks within these spaces, alongside an informed risk assessment. Through analysis of threat and risk environments, visual audits of a site's surroundings and a review of the proposed design, spaces can gain recommendations to help identify appropriate ways to ensure security risks are identified and mitigated - so that they benefit the public. Risk assessments that determine what risks may exist, to what level these risks can be mitigated and measures that should be put in place will create safer cities and public spaces. That means engaging with local security stakeholders and other specialists to tailor the project to the local context. Understanding risk to increase activity Cities are increasingly becoming denser, and our urban spaces more than ever need to cater to and encourage exercise. We have an opportunity to encourage physical activity in the urban public realm by designing, creating and operating safe and secure spaces that also facilitate social distancing. The benefits of safe urban environments are both physical and mental, and while improving our health and wellbeing a reduction in the sedentary population can also offer economic benefits in the form of reduced health risks and healthcare costs. Those involved in shaping our urban public realm should apply people-centred security design early in the design process. This will be a catalyst in providing sustainable, healthy and prosperous cities. 							- This article was written by Richard Bond and Minnie Watson.

52,Designing the Fifteen Minute City,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/designing-the-fifteen-minute-neighbourhood,,"In normal conversation, distance is generally converted to time; something is ‘five minutes down the street’ or ‘a few minutes up the road’. This approach of distance-as-time shapes how we evaluate different social choices and opportunities. Too far often means too long which means too much bother. For urban planners, this dynamic has informed our thinking in a number of ways. Travel time will shape the adoption of particular modes of transport. A car journey will be preferable to walking or cycling for distances over three kilometres. But when you walk or cycle, you go straight to the destination. With driving, you have to find a place to park, then walk to the destination. If we remove parking opportunity, we disincentivise driving. If we don’t provide easily walked and navigated access to train stations, from multiple directions, we can double the total journey length of an urban fringe to work-centre trip and completely invalidate the business case that justified a rail system. The 2020 pandemic has challenged many of our underlying assumptions. An end to the thirty-minute city? We have been slowly producing cities where the opportunity to engage in work, recreation and commerce is within 30 minutes of your front door, where a significant number of people travel in two short daily peaks. But when work is concentrated in city centres and there is a widely distributed and growing population, the complexity of delivering a true 30-minute city (TMC) is beyond many places. However, this year might have provided a new direction. Survey after survey is showing that, post-pandemic, roughly 40% of people wish to work from home 40% of the time. Our own surveys support this finding. This is actually great news for both city dwellers and planners, who are endlessly stressed by the time/distance demands of existing cities: they are about to live and work in something more like the 15-minute village (FMV). Publications COVID-19 mobility insights We surveyed residents of Milan, Madrid and Dublin to determine how lockdown restrictions have altered public sentiment – not only about working from home, but also regarding how people intend to travel post-pandemic. Download If those preferences lead to a real redistribution of work (and many major employers in tech and professional services around the world have already announced a pivot to home working), that will, in turn, lead to more local service and retail jobs in the communities where people actually live. Suddenly, there are above-average-wage knowledge workers at home who need an excuse to get out each day. Services like coffee, food, haircuts, beauty treatments, gyms and other things that concentrate in cities will have an expanded urban market. Commuters, especially those on lower pay, will appreciate greatly not having to travel as far to get to work, saving money into the bargain. On this basis, the 15-minute village (FMV) is likely to boom. This fundamental reshaping and decentralising of the economy and urban landscape is not just a winding back of the clock to when high streets were the place to be and the local businesses all had a shopfront. It won’t go that far because so many services are now digitally delivered, and those people working from home are the people who used to work in those now half-empty glass and steel tenancies. Big cities will try to respond; after all, there are billions in commercial rents that depend on it. But the longer Covid-19 continues, the greater the opportunity to rebalance how our communities will grow. Already, the unsung innovators are at it, with local authorities rapidly claiming space for cycling and walking using tactical urbanist approaches (read Susan Claris’ piece on how Milan has done exactly this). There’s no need to wait to design some complex new scheme – simply throw down some bollards and come back later for beautification. In the FMV, travel only requires space for citizens to make their own way: a leisurely cycle, a casual wander, these become part of the joy of working from home. Read about tactical urbanism in Milan Commerce always flexes to respond to the demands of customers and, if customers have changed how they live, so the investors will have to chase their income to these new concentrations of activity. That will disrupt conventional assumptions for some time. Instead, the billions invested in servicing mass transport for peaks can instead achieve an all-day service across greater geography, giving people a new choice of when to travel and to where, without returning to private cars. When people’s needs go beyond their FMV, they will still want a TMC. Nothing that is in use is wasted, it is just that the intensive use in peaks has dissipated. There lays the opportunity to improve the quality of life, the liveliness of local areas, the rates income to local governments and to harness something healthy and good from an otherwise terrible situation. And FMV does not require a movement, a book or a website. It requires only that we appreciate the places in which we live and support the people and institutions that invest in it. And for governments and their transport agencies to read the data and respond appropriately.

53,The road to new funding: London's public transport after the pandemic,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-road-to-new-funding-londons-public-transport-after-the-pandemic,,"The shift from private cars to public transport options has been a central policy objective in many cities for some decades. Although the funding models vary greatly, many transport agencies around the world are now experiencing financial challenges caused by ongoing public wariness to return to high density mass transit. I want to explore how London might respond. Since the creation of Transport for London in 2001, there has been a consistent approach to reducing car use in London and promoting greater use of public transport, walking and cycling. This approach has been successful – between 1997 and 2017 the city’s population has grown by 20%, yet the number of private vehicle trips in Greater London has remained more or less static, decreasing from just over 10 million trips per day to just under. In comparison, public transport trips have increased from 6m to 10 daily. This approach has benefited London significantly, supporting the growth of high value jobs in its centre; contributing to high levels of quality of life and giving Londoners high quality access to jobs and services. In fact, a whole generation of Londoners now view car usage and ownership in a very different way, with declining numbers of young people taking their driving test and increasing use of cars-as-a-service apps. The public transport city The public transport city Delivering these outcomes has come as a result of high levels of investment in public transport and an integrated approach to planning in the city which enables all of the different policies at the Mayor’s disposal to push in the same direction. The Mayor’s ability to charge motorists for accessing the central area; set public transport fares; define the land use and transport strategy for the city and have a major say in a large number of the cities largest planning applications – have all contributed to the delivery of these outcomes. These powers are not uniformly available across other UK cities and the London model shows what can be achieved with such powers in place. As a result, London has developed as a “public transport city” which has been good for the UK – enabling the London economy to grow and thrive. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. This has created a unique situation in London (not seen in any other global cities of London’s significance) where the cost of operating public transport services in London is expected to be met from revenue that is generated by the Mayor and TfL. Typically, this means fare income but including other sources such as a proportion of business rates (taxes); congestion charge income and revenue from property and other commercial developments. Even with this blended approach, fare income makes up typically 72% of the Mayor’s toolbox to fund TfL’s cost of operations (compared to 38% in Paris). The transport funding gap This has created a vulnerability. Over recent months we have seen a 95% reduction in tube demand and 85% reduction in bus demand in London, which has led to the government stepping in to fund the public transport network. The issue is that tube, rail and bus networks are ‘too big to fail’ – London cannot exist successfully without its high levels of public transport accessibility and connectivity. Thirty years of shifting behaviour towards public transport use cannot be reversed nor should they be. But the existing model, where TfL covers its operating costs from fare income, is now broken. A new model is now needed, which cannot come at the expense of investment in other UK cities. How can London bridge the funding gap? Road user charging One solution could be to introduce a new model of paying for accessing road space in London. This could replace the current (and increasingly obsolete) methods of taxation (road tax, congestion charge, ULEZ and so on) and be aligned much more closely to the true impact of using a car in the city – whether in terms of congestion, carbon or social impacts. Under this new arrangement, car drivers would pay to use their vehicles, when they use them, drawing on technology that now exists, would replace the outdated (and increasingly obsolete) vehicle excise duty and fuel duty. This new approach may not necessarily mean car drivers pay more – under certain circumstances they could pay the same as they do today but the level of cost would be determined by the impact of a trip (calculated in a variety of ways – congestion, carbon emissions). Research undertaken by Arup with Centre for London in 2019 examined how London could use the latest technology to create a simpler, smarter and fairer approach to road user charging. This approach would do three things: It would fully integrate the cost (and impact) of using a car in London with other modes of transport – helping to create a truly integrated transport network focused on delivering the best outcomes for the city It would generate a significant source of annual revenue that could be used to fund the operation and expansion of the public transport network It would be a truly local funding solution, allowing the government to focus its efforts on delivering similar transformation in our other major urban centres such as Birmingham and Manchester. It’s vital we don’t lose the sustainable and socially equitable benefits of integrated public transport in our cities. It’s time for every city to think creatively about how to fund the public transport they depend on. Transport and COVID-19 Arup’s transport planners and risk managers are already helping clients globally in their approach to national administrations to design joined-up policy responses that will renew public confidence and enable a return to the levels of service our economies depend on.

54,Reducing carbon emissions... every working day,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/reducing-carbon-emissions-every-working-day,,"Reducing carbon emissions is a global priority, but how much difference can one individual really make? We’re told that flying is bad, and we’re encouraged to take our own cups to the coffee shop, but how does that compare to the decisions we make at work as designers, developers, and collaborators? What does it mean for the floor-to-floor height, the floorplan layout, or the decision to reuse an existing basement? There are questions for every aspect of our work. These are no longer abstract considerations: climate change is a clear existential threat to all of us. Our industry is still responsible for 40% of global carbon emissions, and a significant proportion of this is the so-called ‘embodied carbon’ - by which we mean the carbon emissions associated with creating our buildings and infrastructure in the first place. I want to convince you that, as someone who works in the built environment, the impact you can have on your carbon footprint is orders of magnitude bigger at work than it is in your personal life. 1. Understand the scale of your responsibilites First we need to recognise the scale of the problem. Let’s look at a few statistics. Skipping a one-way flight London-NYC saves 1 tonne of carbon. Going vegan for a year saves 2 tonnes. And ditching the family car in favour of walking and cycling saves 3 tonnes. In total each year, the average UK citizen is responsible for around 10 tonnes of carbon emissions. By comparison, a typical large office building will have an embodied carbon footprint of around 10,000 tonnes, due to the emissions created through its construction. Even if that building harvests rainwater, is naturally ventilated and uses minimal energy, the embodied carbon stays pretty much the same. So a decision that reduces the embodied carbon of your building by just 1% will save 100 tonnes of carbon. That’s the same as 100 flights, 50 years of veganism, or 33 years of walking absolutely everywhere. Your carbon impact at work is hundreds of times bigger than your carbon impact at home. Step 2: Locate the hidden carbon emissions, and commit to avoiding them As a structural engineer, I am compelled to confess to you that it’s mostly our fault. Or put more positively, the biggest potential savings are within our control. Typically, around two thirds of a building’s embodied carbon is in the structure. From those 10,000 tonnes I just mentioned, around 6,500 tonnes of carbon are embodied in the foundations, columns, beams and slabs. What can you do about it? Well as an example, if you agree to columns that are closer together, limit the number of storeys, and allow the engineer to spend more time optimising the structure, you might halve it. That’s a saving of 3000 tonnes of embodied carbon… twenty lifetimes of veganism! Bigger still are the savings you can make through re-use. Remember that embodied carbon is the carbon associated with making something. If you can manage to avoid constructing a new structure altogether, you just saved 6,500 tonnes of carbon! And even on a small building (say a block of ten apartments), if you can reuse the foundations of whatever used to be on the same site, you could save in the order of 100 tons of carbon. That’s the yearly emissions of you plus nine friends of your choosing. This is why reuse and circular economy thinking areso important, and this is why we support movements such as #retrofirst There are counter-arguments to doing all of those things of course (future flexibility concerns being the most common) but we must make such arguments very carefully. Because no matter how confident we are in our predictions about future uses of a building, we can be even more certain about the present-day carbon emissions of our decisions. Our future resilience demands that we are creative and ambitious now. 1 Triton Square Refurb and reuse We saved 40,000 tonnes of carbon at 1 Triton Square by prioritising reuse and refurbishment over demolition and new construction. Find out more Step 3: Understand that it’s all about timing For a new building designed today, embodied carbon will contribute somewhere between 30% and 50% of the estimated whole-life emissions of that building, with operational carbon (due to heating, lighting, ventilation, water etc) making up the rest. But it is embodied carbon that is being emitted today. Our atmosphere can only absorb so much more carbon before we reach the 1.5°C tipping point of global warming, and that ‘carbon budget’ is due to run out before 2030 if we don’t dramatically cut emissions starting now. This is why embodied carbon is important, and this is why we must make dramatic changes to the way that buildings are designed and constructed now. The biggest potential for carbon reductions is at the start of a project. What will you do differently next time? Together, we can change this Global warming beyond 1.5°C will affect the future of our children and grandchildren. They will have to learn to live through yearly heatwaves and storms currently termed as ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ events, and they will witness millions of ‘climate refugees’ struggling to escape unliveable parts of the world. They could also miss out on the little pleasures in life such as taking their own children to play on the beach – with global sea level rise putting an end to that. So remember: as built environment professionals, your greatest contribution is professional, not personal. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t also consider skipping flights or reducing our meat consumption. But we are in a unique position to make changes with hundreds of times more impact than that. And it is by finding ways to re-use more of our existing assets and embed carbon efficiency in our project briefs, that we will make the most substantial contribution to a sustainable future on Earth.

55,Making great strides: Learning from the revolution on Milan's post pandemic streets ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/making-great-strides-learning-from-the-revolution-on-milans-post-pandemic-streets,,"Empty streets, empty buses, commuter-less streets, 2020’s months of lockdown have offered urban planners a unique chance to carry out research… by simply looking out the window. Like many in my field, I’ve been both struggling with the pandemic but also interested in what it might teach us. I knew that my former Arup colleague, Demetrio Scopelliti, had also been pondering this question in his role as Director of Urban Planning and Public Space at the Agency for Mobility, Environment, Territory (AMAT) in Milan – a city hit hard by the virus and a very strict lockdown. So, we decided to discuss how the city has responded. Many authorities are poised to spend stimulus money, but are faced with new questions about air quality, public transport demand, ongoing safety issues posed by the virus, encouraged by a general public sense that better choices should now be made. Our conversation about Milan, London, Paris and other cities has led us to a kind of manifesto of new ideas for urban and transport planning in the post-Covid period. 1. Take advantage of this unexpected opportunity Demetrio explained that for decades Milan had based its mobility strategies around traditional modes of public transport, building and expanding new metro lines, finding ways to bring more people into the city centre. “We’d been conscious of the need for more walking and cycling, had introduced a congestion charge, but the approach was incremental. Yet after a few weeks of lockdown and empty streets, suddenly we have made progress on new bike lanes, nurtured ‘parklets’ in underused areas of the city and designated streets for pedestrian use – all of it done almost overnight.” His advice for the usually measured and slow-paced world of transport planning? “Take advantage of this unexpected period.” 2. Experiment at speed Milan isn’t the only place to respond at speed. Leaders in London, Barcelona, Paris and other cities have also made public commitments to provide additional bike scheme provision or expand cycle lanes. Looking at the additional 35km of lanes Milan is instituting, Demetrio observed that “it would have taken years to achieve what we’ve managed in just a few months. You have to move fast and push for experimentation while public support is there.” Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch.

Leaders in London, Barcelona, Paris and other cities have also made public commitments to provide additional bike scheme provision or expand cycle lanes. 3. Private cars aren’t the future Lockdowns offer a skewed version of a city’s future, so we have to be cautious in our conclusions. We know that there’s a danger that, faced with the dangers of enclosed mass transit systems, people could return to using private cars, with all the negative effects on congestion and air quality. “There has obviously been a huge reduction in the use of public transport – and we have been aware the crisis could lead to an increase in car usage. So, our thinking as a city is that we need to become sustainable by reducing commuting and private transport, encouraging ways of living without the need to travel huge distances. Our future can’t be private cars – a city needs safe walking, cycling, scooter infrastructure.” 4. Green the streets (put ‘parklets’ everywhere) With Milanese life so constrained, there has been an understandable desire to have safe public places to congregate and reassume some semblance of normal life. Into this moment, comes the idea of ‘parklets’ – converting former parking bays close to shops and bars into small social spaces, helping to stimulate commercial activity. “We found shop owners coming together to request that their streets be re-zoned into ‘parklets’ or totally pedestrianised. And ten were agreed in just two weeks. The authorities don’t need new funds, they simply enable.” The city’s rapid adoption of parklets has been inspiring and there are now over 1000 approved applications for these improvised public spaces across the city. “Despite being unsure of quite how popular this idea would be, we defined a process and it quickly took off. After a little initial resistance, we are now seeing wide support for extended sidewalks and pavements, reusing car parks and so on.” Before and after: Parklets in Milan. Image: Federica Verona 5. You must sell the benefits In every city and country, there’s both a yearning to return to how things were and a desire to retain improvements lockdowns have brought. As transport planners, if we want to build on the advances that we’ve been able to make, there is a public relations exercise to undertake first. “In Milan we know that particularly women and younger people are switching to cycling and walking. And we know that travelling by bike or e-scooter is much faster than getting in a car or taxi for short trips. But we have to make sure people understand this. We have re-activated the city’s congestion charge and need to continue plans for our low emission zone. The idea is to show other modes are cheaper and faster.” 6. Be ready for some resistance Of course, you have to prepare for a degree of resistance when city transport or access is radically changed or reconfigured. Demetrio reflects that “when you reclaim the streets, there’s always some pushback. But the fact that other global cities are clearly moving in the same direction means there’s wider public support for change.” Let's create active cities The economic and social pause by the pandemic might be coming to an end, but the space it has provided for a new public dialogue is incredibly valuable. Existing trends around personal health and sustainable mobility options like walking/cycling have converged during the virus outbreak. If a city as in love with cars, taxis and mopeds as Milan can make a switch, anywhere can. And as Demetrio observes, “thanks to the virus there is now a healthy competition between cities, to respond in the most beneficial ways, and define a new future for their cities. As urban planners we have a great opportunity, so let’s not waste it.” Discover more about active transport Expertise Walking and cycling The health, wellbeing and social benefits of walking and cycling in our towns and cities are clear.

57,Three design lessons for the post pandemic city,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/three-design-lessons-for-the-post-pandemic-city,,"Diseases shape cities. But what if we were able to shape our cities to better fight diseases? These last months have seen life disrupted in every city in the world. The variety and imagination of responses to this crisis has given us as urban planners a huge source of insight. As with any experiment, the findings may take time to review and adopt. But already they point to practical ways in which we can and should be improving the planning and design of our cities. Here are three challenges reshaping urban planning: How can we improve our access to the real-time information that helps cities survive a crisis? What can urban planners do to reduce the impact of a crisis on disadvantaged communities? How should public services be designed to cope with surges in demand? We need city-wide digital transformation Before Covid-19, digital transformation was largely a priority within individual sectors. The pandemic has proved the need for real-time, geo-located, publicly available information to city managers across all sectors. We should no longer consider the digitalisation of health, sanitation, transport, supply chains, and even labour practices in isolation. Digital strategies must embrace the provision of all public services in an interconnected way. This matters because increasingly our cities will combine physical facilities with virtual environments and services. The surge in use of digital networks during lockdown has challenged views on the speed and scale at which digital transformation can be delivered. Already, 5G networks are starting to give us greater capacity and reliability. These networks should not only improve the accuracy and effectiveness of disaster response. They will underpin an ability to respond better and faster to all the changing social and economic needs of those who live and work in our cities. Design should work for everyone Every time an unforeseen event occurs, lessons are learned for the design of urban environments and health systems. This was true of H1N1, SARS and Ebola and will be true, now, of Covid-19. Following those earlier epidemics, however, these lessons were not always shared equally across all districts of a city. Findings were typically not implemented in city outskirts and areas with higher proportions of poorer or more vulnerable residents. The increasing density of our cities has allowed for greater connectivity and mobility. It has helped make our cities more sustainable. But how do we manage density when contagious disease risks turning those advantages into threats? Effective information sharing becomes essential at these times. The communities excluded from the lessons of previous health crises typically have less access to these information sharing networks. How can we address this and see all residents benefit equally from the lessons we learn from this pandemic? In a post Covid-19 world, we have the opportunity – some may say responsibility – to give marginalised groups equal consideration in our planning as we reshape our communication networks and our wider cities. In a post Covid-19 world, urban planners have the opportunity to give marginalised groups equal consideration in urban planning as we reshape our communication networks and our wider cities. Decentralise to build immunity to crisis Many of the public services essential to a city’s life are managed centrally by a single organisation. The surge in demand for those services caused by Covid-19 has exposed how painfully vulnerable such centralised organisations are at times of crisis. During the SARS outbreak in Singapore, three key hospitals were forced to close as the city fought to contain the disease. During this pandemic, severe disruption to supplies of personal protective equipment put shocking numbers of staff at risk in Italy’s hospitals. Will designers of urban systems learn the lessons this time and make decentralisation an integral part of their planning? Privatisation and decentralisation of public services, such as waste collection and healthcare, have proven effective in delivering operational efficiencies. During a crisis, decentralisation delivers another strength: resilience. It reduces the single points of failure that make centralised systems so vulnerable. Coming out of this pandemic, urban resilience should be a top priority for policymakers. As well as decentralisation, we should be considering the risks of cross-contamination between related urban systems. Following the SARS epidemic, for example, Hong Kong introduced regulation to improve the collection and management of wastewater after discovering that SARS was transmitted through connected drainage systems. Urban development has health implications The Covid-19 pandemic has raised new questions, forcing us to reassess the way we design our cities. Without giving up the idea of the city as a social hub, the crisis has also given us an opportunity to rethink the relationship between urban design and public health. The ability to assess and mitigate the effects that development has on health should become a new field of expertise, to help prepare cities to respond more rapidly and efficiently in future. Talk to us about city planning and urban development Adapting to a COVID-19 world The COVID-19 pandemic is a major shock to the world. The human cost is hard to bear and our thoughts are with all those affected. As engineers, designers and consultants we have a role to play - this is a moment to be brave, try new ideas and collaborate to develop services and facilities our communities need.

58,The future of the urban campus,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-future-of-the-urban-campus,,"By James Conway and Catarina Carvalho. In recent years technology companies, research institutions, laboratories, and specialist departments of manufacturing firms have steadily increased their building and employee footprint in downtown urban areas throughout cities in the United States. The Ford Motor Company has an ongoing investment in the Corktown neighbourhood of Detroit, where their properties will anchor a 1.2 million-square-foot innovation hub, including Ford’s dedicated electric vehicle organization (Team Edison) and autonomous vehicle business teams. Amazon has invested significantly in Downtown Seattle where they have located their landmark headquarters and employ over 50,000 people. Harvard University is undergoing a major expansion of their Allston campus in Boston, which includes a new enterprise research campus adjacent to their science and engineering complex and business school. Plans for the research campus include a mix of research-focused private laboratories, public open spaces, residences, and a hotel and conference centre over a 36-acre site. Rendering of Ford's research and engineering campus in Dearborn, Michigan. Courtesy of Snøhetta and Plomp. The drivers catalysing this growth vary, but common factors include being closer to top talent and centres of excellence; increased brand visibility; co-location of specialist fabrication, laboratory, workshop, and research functions; and proximity to key clients. Access to schools, retail, entertainment, mass transit, and international connectivity helps to attract and retain employees who seek contemporary urban lifestyles and amenities. As major companies with urban campuses have flourished, many look to recognize and repay their communities and cities through large investments in their surrounding urban infrastructure, like transit systems and historic building stock. These organizations play a crucial role in shaping their urban landscapes and stimulating city regeneration. While this growth, which often increases real estate prices, has received positive and negative responses from the public, it is difficult to dispute that without this investment, many downtown areas across the United States would look very different. These companies’ ability to lead and adapt their city spaces, and set an example for other organizations, is more important now than ever. In the wake of upheaval, designers of the built environment can help our most prominent businesses and preeminent institutions set out standard-bearing solutions for holistic, resilient design, secure operations, and our return to the workplace. Rendering of Harvard's Enterprise Research Campus. Courtesy of Tishman Speyer. Exploring virtuous cycles in campus design Establishing and managing the urban growth of large companies, institutions, and specialist facilities comes with significant design, planning, and operational challenges. Especially where large floorplates are needed, organizations must navigate restrictive planning policies, overlay complex logistical and security requirements, and address sensitive environmental and community issues before building up their presence in an urban core. By taking a holistic approach, designers can reveal and leverage virtuous cycles to respond to these challenges and drive successful outcomes. For instance, a carefully considered corporate mobility strategy or green travel plan can efficiently answer mobility and supply chain requirements while also reducing a company’s carbon footprint, generating fewer community complaints, and fostering a healthier, more contented workforce. Specialist facility specifics Designers, and the institutions themselves must also consider the safety and security of specialist facilities operating in our dense urban areas. Due to their proximity and increased interaction with the public, these facilities require necessarily higher biosecurity. The Global Health Security Index by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative suggests that national health security is fundamentally weak around the world. The United States leads the world with an overall score of 83.5 out of 100 points (the average overall score among all 195 countries assessed is 40.2). High-security bio-labs are becoming more and more common and the current pandemic is bringing more attention to the safe operations of these facilities. Labs may see a rise in the use of robotics and the automationof tasks that can be performed remotely so that the number of people withinthese spaces can be reduced. Looking beyond the pandemic The global pandemic has forced large-campus organizations to reconsider their immediate operations and adapt their businesses to a new normal. In the short-term, large corporations face their employees going back to an environment where density and co-location has become a liability. In the medium to long-term, we may have a society living on a hybrid of solutions where we are more selective about where, when, and how we travel, with a greater reliance on telecommuting. Planning for the safety, resilience, and business continuity of urban campuses is a tremendous challenge. Though the future is difficult to predict, we’ve identified several key solutions that address the most immediate challenges: 1. Virtual workspaces, but not for everything We expect that there will be a greater emphasis on a virtual campus that is unconstrained by geographic distances and boundaries. It is likely that we will see a hybrid office and virtual campus environment for the foreseeable future with lower demands for conventional office facilities. While this has been proven to work, many firms, especially within the design industry, thrive on face-to-face collaboration or in the case of laboratories, need access to specialist equipment, biosecurity requirements, and environmental-controlled workspaces. In relation to laboratories and other specialist facilities, we may see a rise in the use of robotics and the automation of tasks that can be performed remotely so that the number of people within these spaces can be reduced. Additionally, the floorplates of these facilities will likely increase and lobby and elevator access will be managed differently to support social distancing. 2. Increased collaboration and security Technology and innovation clusters incorporating highly specialized facilities, such as laboratories with different biosecurity level requirements, are becoming increasingly common in our downtown areas. Frequently associated with the expansion of universities and business districts that naturally want to cluster their campus buildings near one another, these developments often attract other similar private operations to do the same, either individually or in partnership. An example is Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a highly successful innovation cluster of research, technology, entrepreneurial start-ups, retail, commercial, and residential developments near MIT, Harvard, and Downtown Boston. Increased collaboration between these companies, institutes, and other stakeholders is required to help manage space, mobility, and other supporting functions efficiently. MIT's campus adjacent to Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 3. Embracing digital transformation The current pandemic has fast-tracked the broad adoption of digital tools designed to support remote business operations when face to face meetings and collaboration were not possible. As we have migrated rapidly to now rely even more on technology-enabled work practices, it is an opportune moment to leverage and accelerate this behavioral shift to embrace other digital technologies that we have previously resisted due to our preference for human interaction. For example, with a range of contact tracing applications being released, we can now recognize the benefits of accurately tracking people and goods. Traceability of movement throughout our urban ecosystems provides significant improvements to operations, planning, supply chain resilience, and resource allocation. 4. What rush hour? Blurring boundaries for working hours and working days As corporate travel plans consider the potential health exposure of employees during peak-hour commutes, employee arrival and departure times will be more distributed and will need to be planned, communicated, and monitored. This spread out rush hour will have significant implications for the transportation systems serving our urban areas, like reducing capacity requirements, potentially easing operational pressures, and allowing for enhanced service. Public spaces around key transportation routes and city thoroughfares may also experience less peak period demand and be easier to manage. A spread out rush hour will have significant implications for the transportation systems serving our urban areas. 5. Repurposed office spaces to serve the community As we begin to accelerate previously identified opportunities to regain public space within our urban streets and deprioritize cars, we may also see an opportunity for office environments to engage further with their communities. Office spaces could be repurposed to create more open and welcoming ground floor environments that provide community and cultural functions as opposed to monofunctional lobby space. 6. Leveraging public-private partnerships for business improvement districts As we anticipate many changes in our urban environments, we need to place a greater emphasis on public-private partnerships to fund, enact, and manage interventions within the city. The presence of highly technological companies can breathe new life into a downtown and be a catalyst for development. A public-private managed growth approach can benefit not only urban campuses but also the communities around them. The business improvement district model in New York, for example, has demonstrated that through simple programming elements, such as occupying underused streetscape areas with public plazas, provides significant benefits to the public and local businesses through increased footfall, environmental quality, and social interaction. This is now an opportunity to translate the new sense of ownership that we have for our streets and public spaces into a permanent condition. The Salesforce Transit Center park in Downtown San Francisco. Technological campuses as mechanisms for sustainable urban futures While the current pandemic has forced us to radically change our lifestyles, alter work practices, consider employee density, rethink how we might use public spaces, and engage in a socially distant environment, it is important not to lose sight of the wider benefits that can be generated by technological campuses and the unique opportunities they present for sustainable urban regeneration. Major corporations with campuses in highly dense urban areas have the ability to rapidly change the landscape of those spaces and influence other connected organizations. Their urgency in leading a more resilient and sustainable new normal is a chance for city agencies and public organizations to improve the quality and accessibility of public realm development, leverage behavioural changes in urban mobility, address climate change, embrace digital transformation, improve community health and wellbeing, and provide resilient public transit systems and infrastructure upgrades. That way, the widespread impacts of campus design can protect the integrity and livelihood of our downtown communities and the businesses that operate within them."

Weeks of greatly reduced road traffic have led to hopeful predictions of corresponding drops in emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx). We know from WHO reports that air pollution is now a major cause of death and disease globally, and even with incentives to drive cleaner vehicles, the problem has often seemed intractable. So, what have we learned from the great economic pause? The evidence is often contradictory and presents us with new questions to resolve before an effective post-pandemic policy response can be crafted. But a few initial conclusions can be drawn. Despite air quality gains, residual emissions remain It's worth remembering that no lockdown led to zero traffic, even in Italy and Spain where restrictions were most severe. A central question arises from the new data: how did an 80% drop in traffic activity lead to pollution falling by only half as much? According to the European Environment Agency, Milan’s NO2 concentrations in the week 16-22 March were down 21%, compared to the same week last year. Similarly, NO2 concentrations in Madrid and Barcelona were 41% lower and 55% lower, respectively (EEA figures). Yet concentrations of fine particles (PM10), which are the most harmful to human health, have not reduced as much as NO2 concentrations. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. A empty road in Milan during the lockdown. Despite similar scenes across Europe, why have fine particles (PM10) not reduced as much as we might have expected? Complicating things, while concentrations have fallen during the lockdowns, these lower levels of air pollution are not actually that unprecedented. We’ve seen these levels of NO2 and PM10 concentrations in previous summer months in normal times across major European cities, thanks to seasonal weather effects. Importantly, background PM10 concentrations have remained largely unchanged. There are various reasons why air pollution has remained a stubborn reality. Private cars, public transport and goods vehicles have continued to operate to support essential services during the lockdown. These often diesel vehicles may be sufficient to sustain background concentrations, but more data is required to understand the true causes. The need to maximise walking and cycling, while shifting to electric vehicles for public transport and goods movements is certainly clearer than ever. We risk the return of the private car So, the lockdown air quality gains risk being partial and temporary. A large-scale return to private car use (out of ongoing safety fears, and limited public transport capacity) will jeopardise wider transport decarbonisation plans. It could also potentially reverse any gains made in air quality and undermine planning efforts to design urban places and spaces for people, not cars. Ironically the lockdown proves people can make personal compromises for a bigger social goal. This should encourage leaders and transport planners to push for bold long-term changes that will reduce pollution and perhaps expand their ambitions on tackling climate change, another issue where personal behaviour change is key. Some cities like Bristol in the UK are announcing car bans for central areas, but individuals and businesses will need viable alternatives, ones tailored to their city or town, if they’re to make the right choices. Pollution measurement must improve, everywhere The last few months have been enormously useful to researchers and scientists, where the systems have been set-up to record air quality data. Not all cities measure pollutant concentrations as much as they should, and yet this data is a vital part of how clean air will be achieved. Without clear data, businesses and the public can’t understand the costs of travel choices and modulate behaviour. Air quality monitoring stations should be an immediate investment. London and Newcastle have shown the value of low-cost sensor networks in providing accurate, reliable and real-time air quality measurements to decision makers. This is particularly important for those parts of our cities where we may be most concerned about exposure to poor air quality, such public places, schools and hospitals. Active travel might not be enough (according to Copenhagen) It remains clear that in the dense, commercial, residential urban fabric of our cities, it will be hard to meet existing health and climate change goals. Personal active travel choices won’t be enough to solve these issues. It will take a multi-faceted planning approach, and a long commitment to achieve. Copenhagen has demonstrated how to create a liveable, healthy and attractive city by integrating sustainable urban transport policies, including land use, public transport and cycling.

Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. A licence to be ambitious Beyond the statistics and findings, the lockdowns have brought air quality right back up the list of public priorities. With air pollution a co-factor for patients suffering from COVID-19 itself, the issue couldn’t be any more material. Decision makers have a license to take the current public awareness of what is possible, and the measures that might preserve the gains we’ve experienced and create bolder and more far-reaching policy. Clean air requires collaboration Despite our understandable hope for an air pollution miracle amid the dark reality of the pandemic, tackling the problem remains a multi-faceted undertaking. It depends on a global understanding of what works (and doesn’t), multi-disciplinary collaboration, and an evidence-based approach, gathered from innovative data sources and analysis tools.

61,Getting from A to C via B: transitioning back to the workplace,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/getting-from-a-to-c-via-b-transitioning-back-to-the-workplace,,"As cities emerge from virus disruption and start to embrace the returning office workers, understanding the integrated nature of people movement will be key to the operators of transport systems and buildings. With social distancing and health management practices front of mind, where will the pinch points lie in our city systems and how can they be managed? While these factors will undoubtedly have an impact on the use of mass transport, the demand for transport services are driven by where those passenger journeys lead to. For most cities of scale, the commercial office drives peak demand. Office workers are used to the experience of arriving at peak time. Lobbies are heaving and often backed up as lift cars are fully loaded to meet the short-term peak in passenger demand. Even ‘pre COVID-19’, the capacity of a building’s lifts is usually the bottleneck in the journey up to a tenancy. As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and begin to return to work, we still expect the lifts to be a major pinch point in the commuting routine, given the need to socially distance within lift cars. So what strategies might be adopted and how resilient are lift systems to changes in demand patterns?  To explore, we’ve run a series of scenarios based on a typical mid-rise A grade building within a city. For most commercial buildings, the opportunities to make significant physical amendments to the building itself are limited. Building tenants and owners will need to consider operational and management overlays to support social distancing during reoccupation while also unlocking the choke point of the lift system. For tenants on lower floors, they could consider the use of fire stairs for day to day access, but only for those without mobility restrictions. The goods lift could also be brought into operation for passenger movement. These measures would take demand away from the passenger lifts and necessitate increased cleaning requirements in areas not typically accessed by office workers. Modifications to the entry lobby and tenancies could include the use of any installed Destination Control System to allocate a pre-set floor based on a user’s swipe card – removing the need to touch shared lift panels. Where installed, lifts could be called via mobile devices in a similar way that some tenants already use them to unlock doors and turnstiles – with consideration given to those who can’t use a particular technology. For tenants with existing agile workplace strategies and/or a newly found capability to work from home, there’s the opportunity to limit occupancy through staff rostering or other methods, and to stagger arrival times of staff to further reduce the peak in lifting demand. Building tenants and owners will need to consider operational and management overlays to support social distancing during reoccupation while also unlocking the choke point of the lift system. But how far would demand need to be managed to adopt the practice of social distancing within a lift car itself? Our modelling shows that for a mid-rise A grade building, a minimum 1.5m separation would mean limiting the car capacity to four people – noting that even this does not meet the Australian Government’s preferred 4m2 per person guideline. In many other smaller and older office buildings it could be two or even one person. Limiting the number of people to each car could be achieved using the Destination Control System where available, rather than relying on individual compliance. In buildings with fewer, larger tenants, allocation of particular lifts to particular tenants/floors could assist in reducing the cross-over of people in shared cars. Design practice for modern A grade buildings provides for a peak of 13% of occupants arriving in a five-minute period. If four passengers per lift car is the controlling factor in this scenario, a managed staggered arrival period of around two hours would be necessary to fill the building to 100% occupancy. This arrival period reduces to 70 mins and 50 mins with building occupancy of 75% and 50%, respectively. Encouragement of a staggered arrival approach providing a specific arrival window would also reduce lobby occupancy and enable space for social distancing. Orchestration and enforcement of such a demand control regime would present significant logistical and communications challenges in large multi-tenanted buildings. It is important here to note that lift performance will likely be part of the Minimum Building Standards appended to a tenant’s Lease Agreement – so the impact of implementing such measures may need to be discussed. Understanding how people move through spaces The scenarios above focus on the lifting system as the bottleneck. However, when we look at how people arrive at buildings – whether by public transit, private car, walking or cycling – we need to consider that people arrive in groups influenced by the surges that come from trains, buses and traffic signals that pulse people into buildings at non-uniform rates. The result of these external influences means lobby queueing systems may need to be employed to maintain social distancing requirements while the arrival group waits for their designated lift. Our pedestrian modelling software MassMotion can help with this. However, when we look at how people arrive at buildings...we need to consider that people arrive in groups influenced by the surges that come from trains, buses and traffic signals that pulse people into buildings at non-uniform rates. An alternative approach is to allow lift cars to load up as normal while ensuring – as far as it is reasonably possible – that people entering the car are in good health. In cities such as Hong Kong, lift usage is not limited but the wearing of masks is mandatory. Temperature sensing is used to check the health status of individuals entering the building – either using hand-held skin temperature devices (a fairly disruptive and slow process) or via a thermal imaging camera with further secondary screening needed using a hand-held device. The logistics of such an operation for buildings that have hundreds or even thousands of occupants is significant. Increased cleaning measures working in tandem Any of these interventions would need to be coupled with continued messaging around behavioural components, such as washing of hands, so as to be seen as complementary rather than supplementary. There will also be an expectation of increased, and visible, cleaning regimes. An example may be the stationing of a cleaner in the main lift lobby to periodically wipe down lift control panels and lift cars before occupants enter. As tenants begin to journey back to work, there will be a level of acceptance of a degradation of lift performance during this period. A combination of demand management and user-led design modifications to lobby spaces could provide an important mechanism to keep our city moving while social distancing remains with us.

62,Planning for a better future: ideas and inspirations for the post-pandemic world,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/planning-for-a-better-future-ideas-and-inspirations-for-the-post-pandemic-world,,"It’s a good time to pause for thought. COVID-19 is a global health crisis like no other, with a devastating loss of life and significant economic, social and environmental impacts. Across the world, cities and their residents find themselves living and working in very different ways. As practitioners involved in shaping the built environment, we are learning rapidly from the experiences of different cities – sharing this knowledge, exploring new data and thinking about the longer term implications. Though these are difficult times, we remain optimists. As many have observed, a crisis is often also an opportunity to change direction, to choose a better path. Our colleagues across the world are exploring what those changes might look like, and what the pandemic might teach us about how to shape a better world.

63,Five city resilience lessons from the coronavirus,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/five-city-resilience-lessons-from-coronavirus,,"From healthcare to high street retail, transport to food and medical supply chains, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, has exposed the limited resilience of our cities. Beyond the immediate priority of everyone’s health and livelihoods, the crisis is an opportunity to rethink the way we plan, design, develop and manage our cities, to make sure better prepared to protect everyone when the next emergency arises. So, how do we improve our response? Meaningful data and information, easily available for use by local communities, is a first requirement. Only then can we make the right decisions about resources, supplies and operations, prioritising support to the people and areas where it matters most. Responding to emergencies is a concerted effort, where communication and knowledge sharing becomes key to ensure citizen safety. Beyond the value of good data, I want to explore five other early conclusions about what the Covid-19 crisis is teaching us: 1. The multi-hazard problem A pandemic has many dimensions. Normally disparate issues suddenly connect and form larger problems. That’s why the traditional single hazard focus – whether it’s flooding, earthquake, typhoons, or bush fires – doesn’t prepare us to tackle the current crisis. A resilient city strategy must understand and explore the connections between multiple and cascading hazards. It means moving away from individual departmental responses to collaborative and integrated efforts by professionals and the community at large. Take the example of coastal flooding, from a storm surge. In many cities, the inland flood risk from heavy rainfall is usually assessed separately. Yet both hazards converge if a typhoon or hurricane occur. A truly resilient strategy would have to understand how the multi-hazard scenarios will unfold. 2. Resilience must be proactive, not just reactive The sudden and unpredictable nature of urban crises often drives the emergency services to react rather than respond in a more considered way. A city’s emergency response system is often designed around rescue work in the event of a crisis, before focusing on post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. However, a better definition of urban resilience starts from a deep understanding of a city’s systems and operation. It’s an approach to resilience that can lead to proactive adjustment. Faced with a crisis, leaders need to know that the relevant preparations have been put in place, allowing them to respond effectively and achieve a rapid recovery. 3. City-wide data must generate real insights In a crisis knowledge is everything. Data sharing platforms aren’t new, neither is the ability to access real-time and dynamic data. Current common data platforms provide a range of data at a national or global level, such as access to United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) data through the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) Prevention Web. While these are useful for trend analysis and global prevention, the data lacks the resolution and relevance to be used at the city or local level. City resilience will increasingly depend on a ‘big data’ approach, using Internet of Things to establish ‘sensory systems’ that accurately capture critical information. This could include population data and essential material flows, to be shared across inter-connected smart city platforms for various applications such as real-time surveillance of epidemic risks, and trend analysis, helping to both prevent and respond to epidemics in realtime. Such a platform would allow leaders to better understand population flow within and across cities, and predict and assess potential risks of disease spread in the event of mass gatherings. The value of that data in a post-social distancing world is clear. In a health crisis, designated hospitals and quarantine areas could be simultaneously analysed through proximity analysis to establish their safety level. Additionally, with the use of machine learning algorithms, the platform could calculate and predict areas with high probability of being affected by future epidemics. This is the kind of intelligence that would be incredibly valuable during the transition out of the current lockdown. 4. Know which systems are critical (and understand how they connect) Cities are complex human machines, webs of services, needs, livelihoods and behaviours. The interconnectedness and dependencies of cities’ many systems means coordination is central to achieving effective resilience. It’s essential to review the risks of individual systems as well as to examine the intercorrelation between systems. Resilience strategists must compile a list of critical infrastructures susceptible to malfunctioning under the effects of various natural hazards and extreme scenarios, defining potential enhancements now. They must also identify domino effects under various hazard scenarios. 5. Frameworks solve the complexity problem Covid-19 demonstrates how major health crises can’t be solved by narrow technical solutions. To achieve the level of interdepartmental or cross-functional coordination a resilient city needs you first need a much broader concept of the city’s overall system-level performance. In recent years, with the support of The Rockefeller Foundation, Arup developed the City Resilience Index (CRI); a powerful tool that is built upon 149 case studies derived from different cities around the world. The CRI provides insights into health and wellbeing, economy and society, infrastructure and environment, and leadership and strategy, developing connections between decision makers, technical experts, physical sciences and the humanities. Investing in resilience takes us beyond the familiar concerns of cost, quality and time. The current pandemic shows us that only an integrated response will work, one informed by shared responsibility and financial accountability, transparent use of data, strong ethics, public participation, and maintenance of natural capital. A global problem must have a solution that works for everyone.

64,The EU Green Deal and building retrofits: making it work for everyone ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-eu-green-deal-and-retrofits-making-it-work-for-everyone,,"The European Green Deal sets out one of the most ambitious road maps for an entire continent, outlining a series of key initiatives to bring greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Exploring plans to create a climate-neutral, sustainable economy transforming sectors like transport, manufacturing and energy; the policy and legislative proposals also look at ways to decarbonise our cities and buildings – ensuring it benefits citizens across the EU while keeping housing affordable. But with around 97% of our existing building stock requiring major upgrades to meet 2050 decarbonisation targets, a few pressing questions emerge regarding the next steps: how can these initiatives play out across the entire region, with its differing climates, code and construction practices? How can we minimise transitional risk for all the stakeholders across sectors, from retail portfolio owners to residential? How do we mobilise all the actors to successfully scale-up these initiatives? And what role can the circular economy play in this transition? We sit down with Arup’s Carbon and Climate Change Director Paula Kirk, Europe Digital Property and Smart Cities lead Léan Doody and Energy, Cities and Climate Change Director Ben Smith for their take on what this could mean for building retrofits, and ideas about how to get started. Can you give us a high-level summary of the European Green Deal (EGD)? Paula Kirk: We have minimal time to meet our commitments to the Paris agreement and transition to a lower-carbon economy. The next ten years are vital and the EGD is the European Union's response to this need. By focusing on transport, buildings, and energy, the EGD is setting out a process to help everybody work together and try and move in the same direction. It is still in the early stages, and over the next few months we will see more decisions made and information shared about how this will play out. Ben Smith: The term 'Green Deal' has been widely used around the world, not just by the European Union, and what makes it different from previous climate strategies is a focus on benefits for jobs. There's a strong emphasis on transition and “leaving no one behind” or investing in the people whose industries potentially must go through a significant shift. It’s partly making sure that they've got the skills that they need to be able to survive in a different kind of economy. Delivering the EU's Green Deal Discover how we can help your business While there have been a lot of conversations around guidance and future regulations for buildings, we don’t often think about the fact that roughly 80 percent of existing building stock will still be present in the year 2050, just 30 years from now. What does that mean for the challenges in implementing something like the EGD? Paula Kirk: It's been categorized as 'hard-to-do' up until now primarily because of the fragmented ownership of existing buildings. For the existing building stock, it's not a simple case of doing it through design standards or planning processes, as with new builds. There have been some successful retrofit programs, in New York and Berlin notably, where city governments have made grant funding available, but that's been very difficult to scale up. Potentially what the EGD will do is create a framework so there's a better understanding of what works. Hopefully it will also bring about the market shift necessary for all the different individuals involved. It is, as Ben mentioned, transition both in terms of putting in place an even playing field for all the building owners so that they have help to make these changes, and in terms of helping to create a European-wide market for those changes to happen. Léan Doody: I think, as Paula is suggesting, that we need to differentiate between the different sectors. In the commercial real estate and retail sectors the institutional investors are driving a lot of change to de-risk portfolios around climate risk. They are being pushed by their own investors to look for more sustainable investment opportunities and will therefore be pushing on funds to green their portfolios. Landlords are also being pushed for more sustainable buildings by occupants. So, there are a lot of market forces pushing to make buildings more sustainable. On the residential front, as Paula mentioned, there have been retrofit schemes in various places around the world, but the challenge is to scale that up using sustainable finance models and a combination of finance and regulation to push homeowners to retrofit their homes. Efforts to date have focused on trying to get the supply chain ready so they can do this kind of retrofit with the new materials and the new technologies. But now the EGD will be focused on trying to scale that because we need to decarbonise our homes on a massive scale - and it also needs to happen in a fair way, so quite a challenge. Ben Smith: Léan is right, it’s important to acknowledge past efforts to drive retrofit at scale. There’s been lots of investment into this area over many years, but when you think Europe-wide, we're dealing with different climates across the region, different construction practices, different regulations. A technical solution that is right in one building type or sector in one region, may not be the right solution elsewhere. Broadly speaking though, we do understand the technical solutions, I don’t think that’s the most pressing challenge. It’s more about appetite and about mobilizing around practical challenges like decanting people out of their homes to complete retrofits. If you consider all the different types, sizes and ages of homes across Europe there will be different retrofit needs - from changing your heating system, installing solar panels, or fitting internal installation or external installation. My sense is that if you offered people in a typical street the grant money and the team to deliver the works – there would still be a hesitation. We need to make it simpler, more attractive and more urgent. It sounds like there’s some resistance to implementing these retrofit changes, both in terms of figuring out the logistics and then understanding the transitional risks associated? Paula Kirk: Where Arup can help is to identify a baseline for the current state of play. We're doing this for some commercial clients – helping them to assess whether their current portfolio of assets is fit for purpose today and in the future, given the climate changes that are likely to occur. The transitional risks are interesting because we’re trying to respond to change in a world of uncertainty. There is no guarantee how changes are likely to happen, be they policy or regulation changes, technological changes, or even, for some of the commercial and non-residential market, changes on the reputational side. People need to be asking themselves what happens if they haven't made changes and business is impacted. Retail clients who haven't adapted air conditioning systems are a very simple example, considering the hotter days we are experiencing. Systems aren't designed to deal with that level of heat and so the systems malfunctioned. For some businesses that has a much higher impact than others; in retail it’s a problem, in hospitals and schools it will have a much bigger impact, but for people in their homes it might just be a level of discomfort that they can live with for three days a year. How do we adapt the current building stock to deal with some of these potential future changes that are driven by climate? When we talk about transitional risk, it's about helping clients understand the risk of inaction, but also the risk of investing in the wrong technology for their scale or type of building. Ben Smith: I hope there is not resistance to change, but there are certainly challenges. The electricity grid – and energy supply generally – is changing. So, the way you design and service buildings needs to reflect these changes. If we shift to 100% wind with some baseload from elsewhere then we can design and retrofit all electric heating systems. The building level solutions will be different if we shift to hydrogen - that’s what Arup is looking at through the Hy4Heat project. And if we are getting in to homes to deliver retrofit programmes at scale then we should also consider measures to adapt to climate impacts – planting trees, de-paving front gardens and so on. If we know the main barrier is getting in in the first place, we should be thinking – how much can we get done at once? There are clearly many areas of uncertainty in this conversation – from technology to policy questions. One that seems to be front and centre now is circular economy – what role does it have to play in the EGD conversation, especially in terms of areas where it’s maybe not as prevalent, like existing building retrofits for example? Léan Doody: I spoke at a client event recently where the global VP of workplace for LinkedIn was discussing the work they're trying to do to decarbonise the construction process of their new buildings, as well as thinking about circular economy in terms of fit-out. I think that's something that we will see a lot more of. Both efforts will require more digitisation to understand and record the types of materials being used and lots of details about specifications. Paula Kirk: What I find interesting about those comments from LinkedIn was that they were almost a throwaway comment –they were obviously thinking about circular economy and they wouldn't ever specify anything that isn't circular. It’s about knowledge and a shift in mindset; understanding this is not necessarily always an additional cost and it's not going to reduce performance. Ben Smith: You can imagine as well in the retrofit context, whether it's residential or elsewhere, that every time you do a retrofit there will be lots of materials coming out of the buildings, whether that's boilers, window frames, radiators, lighting products, furniture. We need to consider how this stuff feeds into a circular economy. I know some of this – basic recycling – has happened forever, but what does it look like in this generation. How can we be more purposeful about recording what's coming out and starting to really incorporate some circular principles? Are there any other areas of uncertainty that are particularly relevant to the implementation of the EGD? Paula Kirk: One interesting question I received recently was: ""What's the big thing that is really important, but we haven’t realised yet?"" For example, decades ago everyone thought smoking was OK and it took a while for public opinion to switch over and realise how bad it is for your health. Eventually there were bans and restrictions and a huge push to stop people smoking. Right now, everyone is very aware of carbon – we’re only waking up to the carbon crisis and climate agenda now even though experts knew years ago that we were in trouble. To me, in 20-years-time the thing we will look back on and realise we really missed the boat, missed the tipping point, will be consumption-based emissions. As individuals we need a more tangible understanding of how much carbon is embedded within the materials we use and products we buy; recently this has started to click for people when they talk about 'fast fashion'. We talk about industries and sectors being responsible for emissions, but all those industries and sectors are made up of individuals and all decisions are made by individuals within those sectors. So, when we talk about needing to bring about change, there is immense power at the individual level to influence the systematic change and the institutional change that is necessary.

66,Circular economy ideas are leading to better real estate investments,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-circle-expands-circular-economy-ideas-are-leading-to-better-real-estate-investments,,"The circle expands The built environment industry has long been identified as a wasteful consumer of natural resources. When the Ellen MacArthur Foundation began promoting the idea of a circular economy – where economic growth is decoupled from resource consumption – the built environment sector was interested, but unsure how to change. The circular economy was initially understood as a ‘design strategy’, focusing on managing materials and waste through the design and construction process. Today, the argument has moved on. In a world where global trends are changing what people want from workplaces, where retail outlets are struggling, and the public is demanding an urgent response to climate change, investments in traditional real estate are getting riskier. It turns out that those same circular principles, when applied to real estate investment strategies, lead to enduring decisions and better returns ten, twenty, thirty years down the road. It is now clear that what was missing was a clear statement of the business case for applying circular economy strategies to real estate. The new report, Realising the value of circular economy in real estate, fills this gap. This has been led by Arup and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in partnership with 3XN Architects / GXN Innovation and with expert advice from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and JLL. Better returns in a world of change If circular real estate isn’t just about materials, what else is it about? The core idea is to adopt new business models to capitalise on changing spaces. By delivering more flexible, adaptable and deconstructable buildings, investors move from making a one-time bet that’s less likely to remain profitable, to owning an asset with a dynamic operational model, one that offers new revenue streams over longer periods and greater residual value. Circular thinking accepts that we can’t know what occupants will require or prefer in one or two decades time, but that if we design smartly and responsibly, we can adapt and stay profitable while avoiding the traditional build and demolish, boom-and-bust practices of yesterday. By designing-in flexibility at the start, you can expect better returns on investment for longer. Circular real estate investing also helps address many of the existing concerns about real estate, (underused space, stranded assets, dwindling appeal to new tenants, costly adaptations etc.) many of which have reduced financial returns. Here are just three of the ideas explored in our new report: Flexible spaces Adaptable assets Performance procurement Flexible spaces Co-working spaces are our inspiration. Like them, our model unlocks the potential of underutilised space in buildings while crucially also balancing the risks normally associated with short tenure space. When explored on a tenanted office space in Milan, the potential additional revenue was found to be equivalent to 18% of the net present lease cost over 12 years. Adaptable assets Buildings don’t stay on top of the market as long as they used to and that’s a problem for investors. By moving to a model based on adaptable assets we can produce buildings resilient to both changing market conditions and social expectations. When applied to a five floor development in Aarhus, we saw the internal rate of return increase by 3% over 50 years. Performance procurement Approximately 20-40% of building energy could be conserved, with many buildings not performing as designed. Investors could shift to paying for performance, rather than products. Scaling this approach up to whole building systems creates the concept of performance procurement, which when tested for a build-to-rent development in London delivered up to a 3% improvement in the internal rate of return over 30 years.

Ideas into action Let’s imagine a real estate investment trust is persuaded of the benefits of the circular economy and adopts it as part of their corporate investment strategy. What do they do? They insist on designing adaptable shell and cores, to allow tenants to select the fit out they need, ensuring it can be easily changed for future users or if requirements change. Smart building technology reveals who is using what space and when. The asset managers work with their tenants to maximise space utilisation and revenue generation opportunities. Building façades and services are procured though performance-based contracts so that tenants are guaranteed better operating buildings to the specification they require. Where sites are waiting for main works to start, a pool of relocatable building operators are called upon to create productive meanwhile spaces. The trust now tracks both the market value and commodity value of its portfolio. The point is clear: a circular investment remit leads to better sustainability outcomes and better returns. “ This report doesn’t just demonstrate that circular economy practices can be built into existing real estate business models to improve sustainability; it highlights the financial benefits of doing so.” Sean Tompkins, Chief Executive of RICS, ” Sean Tompkins Chief Executive of RICS Better business now At every stage of investment, the circular real estate investor is more deeply engaged with what an asset might achieve, how it might perform and how it can stay valuable. Trends like rapidly developing technology, changing occupant expectations and growing demands for climate action are pulling real estate businesses in different directions. Circular real estate investment strategies align these forces, giving businesses a route to commercial success in a carbon-constrained world.

67,3 key ingredients of a successful University city campus,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/3-key-ingredients-of-a-successful-university-city-campus,,"Universities are essential to shaping city life. Historically, they have often set the social, cultural and intellectual tone of the city – Cambridge or Oxford in the U.K, or Harvard or Princeton in the U.S are obvious examples. But globalisation has changed the game. Universities are now seen as vital to boosting city economies to make them as globally relevant and competitive as possible. This is a significant shift of what has traditionally been expected of universities, and I can’t see it changing anytime soon. I’ve had the privilege to work on multiple university projects, here and overseas, on new builds, redevelopments and expansions, and have found three success measures to generally hold true: 1. It’s not just about the students It’s about ‘people.’ Students, while important, are just a proportion of the overall university population. Clearly, they bring in essential income (with growth in student numbers a metric of success and a key factor in substantiating business cases for future development investment) but it’s not just about them. A city campus will not be successful – world-class – if the focus is just on students, at the expense of other users. A successful city campus is one which truly considers the user experience of all. Most students have a limited three-year contact time with a university, yet there is a significant population who have a much longer-term relationship with that university – academics, PhD students, the governance and administration services necessary to operation. In research-focused universities like the Australian National University in Canberra for example, the combined total number of Postgraduates (10,000) and administration staff (3,700) outnumber the total number of Undergraduates (10,000). When creating their masterplan, we had to consider the needs of all these users, as well as how they could better engage with both industry and the local community. Designing for multi-user appeal has become much more prevalent in recent years. It’s core to RMIT’s New Academic Street in Melbourne, and to those being planned by the University of Melbourne at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne, and to those emerging at Macquarie University and Western Sydney University. I believe that a successful city campus is one which truly considers the user experience of all and creates a place that attracts and retains a diverse voice across its full portfolio. It is attuned to the mental landscape of all users, who are asking things like: Do I feel welcome here? Do I feel safe? Do I feel inspired? Is it worthwhile – do I enjoy spending time here? Is this a good place to be for my learning, research, career, general health and wellbeing? 2. They are a destination in their own right The city campus needs to be unique to its ‘place’, and authentic to its identity. A great example is the University of Chicago campus in Hong Kong. Weaving its way along a heritage-protected hillside site it’s a beautiful illustration of how the historical identity of a place can be preserved and amplified through adaptive reuse. The University of Chicago campus in Hong Kong weaves its way along a heritage-protected hillside site in a beautiful illustration of how the historical identity of a place can be preserved and amplified through adaptive reuse. Another is the conjoining of the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Yale. NUS is a highly ranked research university – no 2 in Asia and no 25 globally according to the latest Times University Rankings. It wanted to expand its humanities offering. NUS and Yale agreed to collaborate and create YALE NUS. It’s a brand-new city campus focused on liberal arts and it’s the first location outside Connecticut, USA, in its 300-year-old history. The challenge, as I understand it, was how to produce a contemporary, brand new campus in a new geography that met the expectations and ‘experience’ of an Ivy League US university. It was a genuine blend of east meets west– and to realise the Yale experience, the campus incorporated elements like residential colleges with dining halls and dormitories that were alien to Singapore but expected in an American campus. It works in my opinion – it's authentic. For all the benefits that digital brings, for remote working and similar, it’s well established that retention and academic success are directly correlated with increased contact time on campus. Make the campus memorable! Connections and trust are built on time together. Eureka moments happen when great minds collide. 3. There’s a human need to ‘feel part of something bigger than yourself’ I believe that if you can attract a diverse group of people to a place, all focused around a common ‘purpose’ – a purpose that is bigger than individual needs – the magic will happen. This is the premise behind the University of Melbourne’s Melbourne Connect which aspires to bring the smartest minds together to “solve the world’s problems” and Macquarie University’s on–campus Incubator ready to “serve the world through innovation.” If you were a prospective undergraduate, researcher, PhD student, university governor, administrator or industry collaborator, wouldn’t you want to be a part of that? I know I would.

68,Heritage-led regeneration: learning from St Pancras ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/heritage-led-regeneration-learning-from-st-pancras,,"In 2020 St Pancras International, a railway station in London, turns 13. It has become London’s leading ‘destination’ station: high-end shops, bars, restaurants and a luxury hotel sit alongside a complex transport interchange between metropolitan, regional and international rail services. Now in its second decade, we look back on our work there to see what lessons it can teach us around heritage and the built environment. The station was originally built in 1868 to the designs of the Midland Railway’s engineer William Barlow, whose mighty iron roof, arching unobstructed across the train shed, was once the largest free-spanning structure in the world. The dramatic gothic hotel at the front was designed by George Gilbert Scott, one of Victorian England’s most prolific and distinguished architects. By the middle of the twentieth century the building was unloved and decaying badly. It was nearly destroyed as London, like much of Britain, looked to replace its “vulgar” and “outdated” Victorian buildings. Sleek modernist structures were thought to be more fitting for an optimistic post-war future. Euston station suffered this fate in 1962. Euston’s destruction, and the survival of St Pancras, brought about the conservation movement as we know it today in Britain. The rebirth of St Pancras in 2007 gave it the opportunity to become influential again in a new way: as an exemplar of heritage as a driver for urban regeneration. The conservation and rebirth of the Victorian station As a heritage consultant and architectural conservationist, I am particularly interested in the quality of the building’s conservation. Arup approached the task with a clear brief to preserve as much as possible of the Victorian station’s unique character. Wide-ranging stakeholder consultation was carried out to establish the priorities of various heritage groups prior to and during the project. The key design move was to devote Barlow’s huge shed to trains and hide the new elements – shops, ticket halls, pedestrian flow and all the transport interchange movements – in an undercroft below. A slot was then cut out of the platform level to open a sunken precinct to views of the magnificent roof above. A new shed was constructed to the rear, accommodating the much longer trains of the rerouted Eurostar service from Paris and Brussels. These adaptations were not without their compromises – the transition between old and new train sheds could have been more sensitively handled, for instance – but the project achieved a startling success in allowing the original building to work in a new way. The most important aspects of its original design are framed and celebrated in a modern context. Changes to the building are, for the most part, expressed “honestly”, meaning that new materials are clearly distinct from the old. This is another key principle of good conservation practice. The composite building is satisfyingly multi-layered and architecturally stunning. St Pancras legacy After thirteen years St Pancras remains a prime example of a key principle of modern urban design: that transport interchanges should be centres for density, activity and economic growth. In this way the redevelopment of St Pancras opened the door for central London’s largest brownfield site to be brought back to life. The economic stimulus of public transport can be profound. In this case St Pancras prompted the renewal of its neighbour station King’s Cross and a cascading sequence of investment in the previously inaccessible “railway lands” to the rear of both. These contaminated former goods yards, previously serving the Midland and East Coast main railway lines, have been transformed. Two major educational institutions have moved in: Central Saint Martin’s art school to a converted grain warehouse, and the Francis Crick Institute into a new building drawing significant architectural cues from Barlow’s station. St Pancras prompted the renewal of its neighbour station King’s Cross and a cascading sequence of investment in the previously inaccessible land. Offices, homes and shops have followed – including the remarkable Coal Drops Yard and Midland Goods Shed, both inhabiting former railway buildings, and Gasholders London set inside three conserved Victorian gasholder frames. Gilbert Scott’s station hotel has also been completely renovated. Arup has had a hand in all of these projects, along with various other new buildings on the site. St Pancras stands as a gateway for rail passengers into London, and for Londoners into a rediscovered part of the city. It acts as monument and standard-bearer for an intelligent, sensitive approach to city development which celebrates the heritage of a place and uses it as a propellant for positive change. In Arup’s current work at other stations (including York, listed at Grade II* and positioned next to a famous medieval city centre) we still reference our achievements at St Pancras: a new urban quarter and high-grade public space around a carefully-conserved historic station.

69,Designing culturally inclusive health facilities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/designing-culturally-inclusive-health-facilities,,"Julian Soper, Arup Australasia Health Business Lead, Kirsten McDonald, Associate Principal, Arup International Development, and Ros Moriarty, CEO Balarinji New Zealand’s Māori heritage is entwined in modern life: the widespread integration of Maori culture is an inspiration for Australians as they work to deepen Indigenous cultural awareness and make positive change in design and infrastructure, especially in metropolitan areas. Within government and industry - more specifically the construction sector - there is an increasing awareness and will to affect change to bridge the cultural gap. Embracing inclusive principles in health design With an ageing and growing population – and the growing demand for investment in new facilities - the Australian healthcare industry is shifting its thinking. While health infrastructure was once designed just for clinical functionality, in recent years the industry has embraced changing expectations of how that infrastructure can also improve a person’s wellbeing. How can we implement better, more inclusive systems to deliver capital works in our cities to support human wellbeing - where we think of cities as complex ‘living’ systems, with co-dependent parts? We can learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples how to design healthcare facilities that treat the whole person beyond the medical presentation. The concepts of mindfulness, connection to nature, caring for Country and caring for family are important in achieving health and wellbeing. A connection to the outside environment, access to multi-level large green spaces that can embrace family groups, the orientation of buildings to face the sunrise or sunset, and a connection with smoke and fire offer potential for significant healing benefits when brought into a contemporary context and integrated into urban health facilities. These are fundamental concepts which have been embedded within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sensibility for millennia. So, as well as green hospitals and resilient design to combat climate change, we now have opportunities for better integrated, culturally inclusive health facilities. A more culturally informed facility will maximise access to health services for all Australians. “ This shift includes acknowledging a wider participatory system is integral to designing more culturally appropriate infrastructure, including health facilities. If we look at design through a single lens, we fail to capture socio-economic opportunities for all Australians. ” Kirsten McDonald Associate Principal The much-needed step change: collaboration Creating culturally inclusive health facilities is not a new topic of discussion; regional areas of Australia have long acknowledged that local health facilities need to be culturally informed. The Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH Capital Works Programme) along with state and territory governments have funded the design and construction of culturally appropriate medical facilities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples around Australia for decades. These facilities accommodate Aboriginal Medical Services (community-controlled organisations) to deliver holistic services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples incorporating social, cultural and emotional wellbeing. To incorporate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander narratives into the urban health context, another change is needed – collaboration. A key aspect of this rethinking has focused on how to better engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander end-users to guide the design requirements and accommodate the functional and cultural needs to support wellbeing. To do this more widely will rely on the industry to change processes more fundamentally. “ For some years, Arup has been rethinking its approach to the design and delivery of major urban projects with a view to maximising the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from the outset. ” Julian Soper Principal The way forward In the context of health infrastructure, there is no one-size-fits-all for embedding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stories into design; it will differ between facilities and places. However, there are underlying principles which are important for decision makers to consider: focus on the process, think about the product, and think beyond the product. Focus on the process: Make sure it’s culturally informed. Think about the process and engage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and consultants from the beginning to shape it in a meaningful way. When we focus on the process, on the way these facilities are designed, delivered, constructed, operated and maintained, we see significant benefits and efficiencies. Think about the product: Wellness is an underlying constant – the end product should reflect not just the physical wellbeing of an individual, but also the social, emotional, and cultural wellbeing of the whole community. This may include linking spaces to outdoors, ensuring connection with Country, creating spaces that are accessible and not intimidating, and arranging the spaces to accommodate expanding and contracting family groups. Balancing these needs with clinical requirements is critical. Think beyond the product: For facilities geared specifically to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, it is crucial to go beyond the design of physical elements to include designing the process of delivery so Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples local to place tangibly benefit from the economic opportunity, as well as contribute knowledge and skills. Rethinking the processes by which we plan, design and deliver Organisations such as Balarinji are playing a critical role in the activation of the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the co-design of major projects. Balarinji is helping in the shift to Indigenous partnerships, acting as an interface between the translation of Indigenous design and the delivery of the built environment. “ It’s hard to understand why in 2019 our foundational narrative of Australia is invisible in much of our infrastructure. ” Ros Moriarty CEO of Balarinji In an Australian first, it has developed cultural design principles to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stories within large public infrastructure master planning and design projects, such as the Sydney Metro West (rail line) and M12 Motorway. “We pursue deep collaboration with Indigenous communities to establish the stories that are important to them and significant to the local area. These stories then underpin design principles,” Ros said. “We translate those themes and stories for master planning or project design teams, and work with those teams (and with local community) to bring visibility to Indigenous narratives in Australia’s public places, public architecture or public projects.” For designers and design teams this means exploring a way of seeing the world they might not have ever considered before. “It’s not simply about a painting on a wall; it may be the way the building is orientated to where the sun rises or sets, or it may be how it embraces the elements for a particular reason. “Exploring those themes at the front end of projects is exciting for the sector. “And we are finding that once these projects are underway, it’s a ‘lightbulb’ moment for the teams we work with - large engineering companies and prominent architectural firms. They ‘get it’ because they’re working in a different way and they see the value: the design sector is at the apex of the intent to bring the community along.” Creating health spaces that embrace Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples requires new ways of thinking. But inclusive health facilities can bring wellbeing benefits for all people. By reframing how we approach the design of our health infrastructure, we are also creating a more vibrant Australia that recognises its founding identity and embeds the values of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to achieve better outcomes for everyone. By acknowledging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ deep knowledge and culture, and developing inclusive partnerships for co-design of major urban capital works, we continue the journey to Reconciliation.

70,Global challenges demand global responses,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/global-challenges-demand-global-responses,,"The challenges are complex, but the global mood is shifting to shape the critical collaboration required to find and fund solutions. In an era of populist politics, climate change, demographic shifts, poverty and inequality, the one thing the world has an abundance of today is global challenges. Whether it is the increased risk of extreme weather events, geopolitical tensions arising from the US-China trade war, or concerns over resource constraints from water to rare earths, the reality is that many of the most critical challenges we face as a global society demand global cooperation to find effective solutions. The good news is that not only is there is a renewed sense of urgency on the need to take coordinated action across the globe, there is also a rapidly evolving number of tools and technologies available to make a real difference in tackling these challenges. Take climate change. More and more countries and companies around the world are signing up to the challenge of delivering the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), recognising the Equator Principles and committing to make a change in the wake of the Paris Agreement. We are far from securing a universal consensus about how to get there, but there’s a growing movement making clear their intention to act and there are plenty of good examples of nations and firms that are setting an example and leading the way. Perhaps most importantly, innovation and technology are providing cost-effective solutions to many of these global challenges as we see the spread of increasingly affordable developments in renewables, digital environments, AI and electric vehicles. Indeed, the declining cost-curve for renewables and storage is set to be one of the biggest contributors in a shift toward a better future. However, the pace of change in achieving sustainable and resilient infrastructure has to be ramped up considerably if we are to mitigate the challenges we face as a global society. Follow the money That is why Arup is actively seeking out progressive partners and clients around the globe to drive faster progress in key areas. For example, the firm is working with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group to help mayors and city authorities to understand where best to focus their scarce resources to tackle carbon emissions. The firm is also working closely with the Rockefeller Foundation to help countries around the globe foster city resilience. Equally, Arup is working with Lloyds Register Foundation via the Resilience Shift team to research and disseminate best practice in the delivery of resilient integrated infrastructure. And elsewhere, the firm is driving change on a host of climate critical projects, whether it is solar PV and smart grids in South Africa or creating 30-year resilience masterplans for cities in areas of water scarcity. There is only so much one group can do on its own though. We need to build better networks and share best practice. We need more organisations to collaborate on a shared ambition to deliver low-carbon, efficient and resilient infrastructure. And let’s face it, we need the financiers on board as key players, especially as it will be in their interest. Financial institutions that back ‘business as usual’ investment reliant on old approaches to infrastructure will soon be left holding stranded assets and a host of reputational risks. A fact that banks, insurance firms, pension funds and sovereigns are rapidly coming to realise. So much so in fact, that the focus on new funding mechanisms for sustainable and resilient infrastructure is expanding at breakneck speed. In fact, this year, green bond issuance is easily on track to surpass US$200bn from zero just over a decade ago. Issuers are rushing to market with whole new ranges of infrastructure investment tools, from SDG and Social Impact Bonds, to decarbonisation funds and catastrophe bonds designed to help groups of nations build resilience. The level of interest and the pace of activity is intensifying as awareness spreads among policymakers, businesses, city authorities and the financial community. The key challenge now is to translate this growing awareness into practical outcomes that work for nations in different geographies and at differing stages along the development path. In reality, the case for well-designed, future-proofed, sustainable and resilient infrastructure shouldn’t be a difficult argument to win. There are abundant examples that attest to the fact that poorly designed infrastructure is extravagantly expensive in terms of the legacy it leaves behind – technology that soon becomes obsolete, stranded assets, and the lost growth opportunities that result from creating polluted, congested environments. It is up to all of us to build rapidly towards this shared ambition for a better society. The critical question now is how fast we can ensure that we act together to take on the global challenges that we all share.

71,Listening to Lima: how to host a major sporting event,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/listening-to-lima-how-to-host-a-major-sporting-event,,"Hosting major sporting and cultural events gives a city and its people significant opportunity to rebuild, reform, fine tune or discover new capacities. Winning any bid is an incredible prize, and the 2019 Pan American and Parapan American Games in Lima, Peru, was no exception. Through the first-ever government-to-government agreement outside a military contract, Arup was appointed to provide specialist technical assurance advisory services, and worked as part of an integrated UK delivery team. As the Peruvian capital adjusts to its new status as a successful host city, we thought it would be valuable to share what we learned from supporting the design and delivery of the largest sporting events in the world, in just 18 months. Design is a listening exercise Peru wanted to use the games to transform its sports infrastructure and accelerate economic growth. Producing sporting event infrastructure is a huge collaborative effort and relies on the right approach to communications and decision-making. Deadlines are tight, reputations are at stake. How you work is as important as the design ideas you develop; a culture of listening is vital. The only unconditional deliverable for a major event no matter which country, city or culture you’re in, is excellence in venue design, performance and legacy. Everything else, including how those venues are contextualised, varies in each host city. Therefore, building a close partnership with the client to understand and help uncover Lima’s unique urban, infrastructure and system challenges – and the desired changes for the city and outcomes for its communities – was crucial. Long term benefits Lima’s primary long-term aspiration was to deliver venues in areas that could benefit from infrastructure development. Once the games were complete, the venues would continue to serve neighbouring communities. Approaching the project through this clear vision rather than a series of ‘big tasks’ ensured the design and delivery all made sense long-term, which is particularly important when a host city faces other competing spending needs. This not only grew the value of the sites but revoked places into vibrant areas for the community. Venues: bigger is not always better If sporting infrastructure ever gains criticism, it’s usually for venues that lack future use. Part of our knowledge-sharing with the client was introducing temporary venue structures – ones just as impressive and capable, but without the capital expenditure and future operating costs. We worked closely with the local design teams, reviewing over 7,000 drawings, to adapt each existing design. This meant delivering practical, energy efficient, low maintenance venues, which offered effective connectivity to surrounding areas, so that it could produce long-lasting benefits. Good governance means a more inclusive city Major sporting infrastructure developments provide a country with a wealth of new ideas. In Lima, we wanted to share what we’ve learned about shaping venues through accessible design so that they are truly open to all. How countries treat this issue in their building codes varies greatly. So, we developed an Accessible Design Guide for the Lima project, that brought together principles of accessible design, how to apply them to everything from wayfinding to entrance design. The guide was recommended as a new universal standard for design across Peru by Carlos Neuhaus President of the Lima organising committee. International collaboration: the way forward We believe that knowledge gained from these wonderful international collaborations should always be transferred. The new ways of working through the government-to-government agreement and the UKDT has delivered a more open, transparent and collaborative approach to major infrastructure projects. Arup has gained a wealth of knowledge from Lima, and we are excited to continue to support the city and Peru in its post-Games evolution. “ As a team, we demonstrated to the world that in Latin America we can be a referent of efficient organization and execution, and with this dedication, we returned the confidence to the people of Peru to undertake great and new challenges as a country. ” Alberto Valenzuela ector of Operations and General Manager of the Games Discover more about sports venues Expertise Sport The greatest sports buildings come out of creative partnerships. Arup works with leading architects and the organisers of sporting events worldwide to create venues that are as hardworking and inspiring as the sports people that use them.

72,A shared city will include seniors,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-shared-city-will-include-seniors,,"The world’s population is aging dramatically. In 2017 there were an estimated 962 million people aged 60 or over, comprising 13% of the global population. By 2030, that number is expected to rise to 1.4 billion. Due to rapid urbanization many of the world’s seniors will now live their entire lives in urban environments, a major demographic shift that necessitates reshaping a built environment originally designed to cater to the young and able-bodied. Making urban environments more inclusive is always a challenge, whether you’re a planner looking to improve mobility for people with low incomes or a designer seeking to enhance access for people with disabilities. But adapting our cities for aging populations presents unique challenges because the senior demographic is intersectional. Pallavi Mantha from Arup’s sustainability team and Michael Amabile and Greyson Clark from our integrated planning team recently participated in a discussion on the challenges and opportunities that come with designing for aging communities. This is a major demographic transformation that hasn't been discussed much until recently. Has Arup been tracking this trend for a long time? When did you start thinking about the implications of aging on the work you do? Michael: Arup, specifically our UK and Milan offices, has been involved in projects globally for some time that have helped bring attention to the issue. What drove me to think about aging was personal experience. My father was ill and having trouble navigating around the house. As a planner, I couldn’t help looking at my parents, and seeing the issues surrounding two senior adults living in a suburban house way too big for them. I started wondering how you extricate a person from the physical surrounding that no longer works for them while not totally disrupting their lifestyle, and what financial and societal and cultural factors are tied to that. So, I asked our team what we do to design or plan for aging populations. Most people said, ""It's something we try to think about, but if it isn't in the scope then sometimes it falls through the cracks."" Are there any organizations leading the charge on awareness and making this issue a priority? Greyson: In 2007, the World Health Organization established its now widely adopted framework for age-friendly planning, which identified eight domains everyone should consider when planning for seniors. Michael: Many cities have had dedicated groups of professionals looking at aging for a while. Here in New York City, it's the Department for the Aging. Most of their work has been focused on public health, but as people are living longer, healthier lives, the issues are changing. A lot of New Yorkers over 65 aren’t dealing exclusively with health issues, they’re expanding the population of active adults. One of the popular stories you hear these days is about well-heeled empty nesters giving up their big house in the suburbs to move into the city so they can go to the theater and stuff. This is a big shift when you think about where most American cities were 25 or 30 years ago. Now cities are cool, which is great because cities can provide a lot of what older people need in terms of density and concentration of services. So you’d say living in an urban environment is beneficial for older people? Greyson: Cities provide benefits when it comes to autonomy and independence, especially in the US. It’s all about land use. Most American seniors aren't urban dwelling: they're more metro, suburban dwellers, which means they don't have transit access, so they can’t get where they need to go — whether it’s the grocery store or the park or church — unless they drive. Pallavi: Cities are great for seniors in many ways, but there are also challenges. In New York City, for example, we have an aging infrastructure that wasn’t built with seniors or children or parents with strollers in mind. Many features in the city aren’t wheelchair or walker accessible. Then there’s affordability. The story of the well-heeled retiree moving to Manhattan is great, but that’s not available to everyone. There’s inequity in how well cities serve the aging population. In New York you'll find pockets of mostly white people and pockets of mostly people of color and the benefits and amenities available to these groups can be vastly different. For instance, there’s a lack of parks and green spaces in many neighborhoods where people of color live. Green spaces are important because they help offset the urban heat island effect. Without them, we encounter more extreme heat issues — and extreme heat is the most fatal of all the natural hazards, especially for seniors. Are you aware of any city-level efforts to address this? Pallavi: NYC’s Cool Neighborhoods Initiative outlines the issue and proposes interventions. Arup’s sustainability group worked with the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the largest landlord in the city, to research how to protect their senior residents from the most dangerous effects of extreme heat. Right now, over 20% of NYCHA’s roughly 390,000 tenants are over 62 years old and those numbers are set to grow. NYCHA wanted to come up with a strategy to help older residents stay in their own homes during extreme heat. We studied what combination of interventions would be required to keep temperatures at safe levels and, after looking at a variety of passive measures, we found that sheltering in place could only be done safely with the help of air-conditioning and backup power to ensure cooling isn’t compromised during power outages. NYCHA is now launching a smart air-conditioning pilot project at one of their senior buildings in Manhattan. It’s fair to say that you can’t talk about “seniors” as a homogenous group anymore. Not only are the needs of the active 65-year-old very different from those of the ailing 93-year-old, but there’s real inequity when it comes to accessing the benefits a city has to offer. How do you address the challenge of planning or designing to meet such a broad range of needs? Greyson: You need a broad view. In our Cities Alive: Designing for ageing communities report, we looked for global best practice strategies in age-related design across four categories: security and resilience, health and well-being, autonomy and independence, and social connectedness. Across those categories there are several urgent issues. Extreme heat is something we addressed in “Cities Alive.” Also, the affordability of cities, which goes beyond the needs of seniors and impacts a lot of people, but there are senior-specific interventions. There are many anti-displacement, affordable housing strategies that are well researched but not broadly implemented. Are they not happening here in America or are they just not happening in general? Greyson: It's kind of mixed. Some cities are better than others and some countries do more than others. For instance, we know that aging in place is a big issue that cuts across autonomy and independence, health and well-being, and social connectedness. But there are big challenges with affordability. Many people want to stay in their family homes, but the homes are big and too expensive to maintain, while others are simply priced out of their apartments. The municipal public housing developer in Birmingham, UK, has a good program where bungalows are designed specifically to support aging in place. They're two-story buildings, but all critical functions are located on the ground floor so if you lose the ability to go upstairs, you can continue to live there, and the second floor can be used as a caregiver's space. They built these to try to encourage older people who were living in nearby public housing that had grown too large for their needs to move, so that those units could be opened for families. Michael: And, because these bungalows are close to where these people had been living, they address another need: connection. “Aging in place” is generally used to describe allowing people to stay in their homes, but it is about more than the physical aspects, there’s also a social cohesion element. Many people are less attached to their apartment than to their neighborhoods. They want to stay close to their synagogue or their doctor’s office. They want to stay close to their life. Are there any countries that are real standouts in terms of the way they are dealing with age-related design? Pallavi: In Japan, they are doing a lot of innovative things to allow people to age in place. They have entire elder villages and towns with a well-connected social fabric. There was a recent news story about one of these towns with a mobile doctor that visits regularly. Seniors can schedule check-ups and the doctor is familiar with each person’s health history. The service works not just to improve people’s health, but to support social cohesion. When the doctor comes it’s like a social event — everyone gathers. Greyson: Kampung Admiralty in Singapore is another great example. They are creating a community within a development — there’s senior housing, rooftop terraces and gardens, a medical center, a South Asian food court, a supermarket, and childcare facilities. They also have interesting programs to promote intergenerational activities, such as asking parents who collect their kids from care to commit to bringing groceries to residents who can’t shop for themselves on the same trip. It’s a social service and a connectedness touchpoint. There’s a trend toward this kind of development in the US, but it’s happening mainly for older people who can afford to buy into nice, new urbanist developments. Pallavi: Yes, it’s not surprising that the first examples we see of this in the US are in wealthy neighborhoods. It's the same fight we've been fighting forever. Part of the work to be done to make these solutions more broadly available is about policy-making, but another part is about reckoning with historical injustices. What do you think we at Arup could be doing differently or better? Greyson: We’re at a pivot point where the conversation about aging is trickling down from the public health and policy arena into our industry. I’d like to see Arup make an active difference and I think we’re well positioned to do it: we’re progressive designers. Our ethos is total design — it’s about being holistic in how we think about the built environment. That means creating more socially conscious designs and considering the full range of users. Michael: The individuals at our firm care about this issue, I think. I want to look for concrete ways Arup can be more involved in cities, because cities are facing a big increase in their senior populations, which makes these issues even more pressing. I think a good place to start is by looking at the work we’re already doing. Look at your project and ask yourself if there’s a way to make it more age friendly or generally more inclusive."
73,Cities: is better dialogue the key to a better city?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-is-better-dialogue-the-key-to-a-better-city,,"The future of our cities has become a hot topic. This isn’t surprising when you consider that the majority of the world’s population now lives in cities and within a generation as many as 70% of all people will be urban dwellers. In Australia, more than 70% of people already live in the state capital cities. So, cities matter to more and more people – as does making sure they work well and justly for them. In acknowledging the importance of our cities, in celebrating what they offer, we must always remember the challenges of urban living and indeed the fact that more and more people are finding it difficult to realise for themselves the full promise of the city in which they live. The unaffordability of many cities, the long commutes many people incur to get from far-flung homes to well-paid jobs or the dangers many experience at night in certain districts – these have become every day concerns for millions of city-dwellers. Modern cities promote excitement but can also be anxiety inducing, with the economic dynamic of cities and the pace of their growth increasingly raising questions about liveability and inclusion. Do our cities work for all? Can they? Whatever the policy answers might be, almost more important is the civic dialogue which identifies a city’s key challenges now - and for future generations - and the opportunities to come up with those answers. Cities are not easy things to run and we need answers wherever we can get them. And while I accept that some answers are bound to come from top-down technocratic sources and others from bottom-up community ones, I think the best cities are the ones which provide optimum opportunity for top-down and bottom-up to come together in a civic dialogue and problem sharing framework which leads to effective and legitimate urban solutions and delivery. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Good city governance matters immensely, and it separates the great cities from the rest. Good urban governance enables communities across a metropolis to share an understanding of the key dynamics and trends shaping their city and to help shape and then sanction relevant interventions. At a basic level, it also helps provide a shared identity and civic focus to the diverse inhabitants of a modern city: we may differ in terms of origin and cultural background, age or even language, but this is our city and its future is collectively decided by us. The language may not be shared but the dialogue is, as are the institutions of metropolitan government. This is no academic matter though I have spent many years analysing it academically. I experienced personally how London benefited from the return of a metropolitan authority after decades of there being no London-wide governance. Professionally I worked for the Blair Government as an adviser on legislation to give even more powers to the London Mayor, then Ken Livingston. Yes, the benefits were partly through having a better link between metropolitan problems and metropolitan solutions – such as the way London introduced the congestion charge and dramatically improved its public transport network and performance. But they were also partly about creating a better civic dialogue to help Londoners talk about their problems, to share solutions but also, crucially, to help them feel more involved in London and its response to major city-shaping trends. People did feel involved and engaged even if not all the solutions worked. ‘We’re in this city together’ – that’s the feeling that good metro governance and community engagement at a strategic level can engender. It was because I’d experienced this that when I ran the business-led, civic advocacy group, the Committee for Sydney (from 2011 to 2017) we advocated for Sydney to develop if possible, some institutions of metropolitan coordination and governance. The intent was that these institutions would also seek to involve Sydneysiders in co-planning their city as a whole, beyond whatever local government boundary they inhabited. In 2015 the first such metropolitan coordination body was created for an Australian city: the Greater Sydney Commission with a mission to promote strategic urban coordination across government and a deeper dialogue about the city’s future with Sydneysiders. The revolution is under way. Where next? There is potential for further progress. Perhaps the GSC could evolve towards greater democratic accountability with the ultimate goal of an elected GSC for metro Sydney – like London. Another positive change could be around digital technologies and enabling people of all ages, backgrounds, genders or jobs, to engage speedily and efficiently online in shaping policy and solutions to the city – or even just sharing a big conversation about what matters to them. Internationally, we are seeing some radical experiments using technology to redesign government and engagement – and we need to see more of this quickly in Australia. Where we’re lacking traditional style metropolitan governance we could usefully do with some virtual governance initiatives of this kind. I once wrote a report about this subtitled: ‘towards a more data-driven and responsive city’. Its main title sums up what I think the best cities are about and what we need to embrace if we are to solve our urban challenges. We are the City."
74,Architects in war zones: how to protect the future ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/architects-in-war-zones-how-to-protect-the-future,,"Contemporary warfare is no longer waged in trenches and on battlefields, but rather in cities, towns and villages. In the last two decades, from Syria and Iraq, to Yemen and Libya, we have witnessed how cities can be radically reshaped by intense and deliberate destruction of the built environment. But even during the destruction, there are some ways to support architects, engineers, planners and activists to save what remains of a places’ character, history and future. Architecture might not seem an immediate priority in the middle of a war. But recent and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East show how monumental architectural artefacts are wilfully targeted, to erase communities’ identity by destroying their history. The term ‘urbicide’, the deliberate targeting of the built environment, including residential areas, goes beyond historic buildings, and has been a feature of the eight-year war in Syria. It’s a cold, calculating attempt to reshape future life on the ground, in line with the dominant party’s own vision of the future. A shop reopens in a ruined building in Homs. Image source: Zaher Abdelmawla Documenting the future Despite a myriad of other day-to-day difficulties, architects in Syria have been attempting to respond. They’ve been mapping damage, protecting and documenting local heritage amid the ongoing damage and destruction. As a Syrian architect myself – from Homs, where over 50% of the city has been heavily destroyed – I have been researching how practitioners from outside the country could provide better support to architects on the ground. Here are some of the ideas and priorities suggested by architects in Homs: Form research collaborations and partnerships with universities outside the country. These can provide vital information and hope to architects in war zones, and will help young architects by reviewing their work and providing guidance. Such collaborations will enable local architects to access the latest research on the built environment, especially at times where many Syrian academics and scholars have fled the country, and will help academics and researchers outside Syria to understand urban and community resilience in warzones. Transfer knowledge through online workshops and academic courses. This could include a wide range of themes such as research methodologies, project management courses, and digital skills to collect and analyse data. Develop online libraries to share learning materials, educational tools and project case studies. During the Syrian conflict students have had no access to online academic libraries, there is a need to create these libraries to learn about the emerging debates in the built environment. But what many architects noted was the need for knowledge on different cities that were destroyed and then rebuilt in the past (as Warsaw, Berlin and Beirut), to learn from these situations. Translate materials into local languages. It’s vital that architectural materials are in the local language, not lost to the local population because the NGOs involved use English for example. Provide training opportunities outside the country, via conferences and other programmes. These could include visits to cities that went through conflicts and were rebuilt in the past, and further explore how urban environments through the materialisation of reconstruction could either divide or bring people back together in war-torn cities. Other ideas could include training to use digital tools and technologies to achieve, document, 3D scan and map damage, focus groups on urban activism, and creation of community engagement platforms where architects can collect people’s needs and wants for the future reconstruction of Syria. These are just a few of the ways that solidarity between practitioners in distant countries can be turned into tangible support. Despite the desperate nature of the context, these activities would allow architects to stay fully involved in their communities, perhaps more aware of how their discipline can alleviate some of the social, economic and development crises caused by war. Architecture is a fundamental part of a city or town’s identity and a community’s history. By offering support to local architects from outside war-zones we can help those communities to retain a future that they recognise.

75,"Bricks, data and mortar: it's time to build in the intelligence",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/bricks-data-and-mortar-its-time-to-build-in-the-intelligence,,"When the modern office first appeared, it was a factory for white collar workers: a big box where people could sit and process information, on paper, in files, by person and by phone. As the digital era has reshaped everything about our world and our work, so it’s become clear we need to revisit some of the assumptions about the shape of the buildings where people congregate. And it’s not just offices. Today, wherever there are people, there is data that could be better served by the buildings or assets people are using. The next generation of building design will take place in an era marked by artificial intelligence. This promises to take data and turn it into incredibly responsive services and experiences. Yet to date, the built environment industry has been slow to understand the implications, and slower to spot the opportunities. Too often buildings’ IT packages are more of an after-thought, something to fit in, not an opportunity to be seized. Construction technology plus imagination equals long term value Change is coming. Developers are increasingly asking about the data performance and features of the buildings they fund. They know users, tenants will demand flexibility, and that buildings that can’t change purpose and performance are less valuable over the long haul. There are implications for design. It means the data, sensor, intelligence aspects of an asset must be considered right at the start, no longer viewed as a final stage ‘cabling issue’. Consumer technology has already commoditized much of the I.T. required, meaning cost isn’t prohibitive. The real challenge is integrating data and AI in a flexible, intelligent way, that generates real value for developers, owners, tenants and users. As new buildings, like the fittingly titled ‘White Collar Factory’ in London’s Shoreditch set new standards for responsiveness, environmental control, connectivity and future flexibility, demand for this approach to intelligent buildings is likely to build quickly. Real time sensors monitor the health of the Stonecutters Bridge Real time monitoring We’ve already established the value and power of intelligent assets. We’ve been helping our bridge clients by embedding real time sensors, for the Stonecutters bridge in Hong Kong and Queensferry Crossing in Scotland, that can power autonomous operational systems. In the lift manufacturing industry in Hong Kong, as lifts age the government is insisting on more real time data collecting sensors for their maintenance.

Recently implemented on One Taikoo Place, a commercial tower in Hong Kong, Neuron provides a new level of real-time control over the building’s many systems. Machine learning and AI allow the many systems to combine more like a living thing and improve over time. These tools add real value to operators, tenants and users alike. Making sure a building is designed to take advantage of them is key. Find out more about Neuron Artificial intelligence is still developing but there are already affordable, edge-AI boxes that process local data about building performance, right on the premises. This brings rich data-driven operational services to almost any user, even those without the deepest pockets. And as ever in the digital era, whoever can turn raw data into valuable operational intelligence will succeed. Intelligent buildings, smarter industry A building’s digital performance is as key to its long-term value as how well it deals with climate, energy or other physical factors. This should be the mantra for this digital built environment era. Data, bricks and mortar are all part of one seamless understanding of what the end user will need, long into the future. Construction might be one of the last industries to become truly data-driven. Perhaps some established businesses still believe that A.I. doesn’t need to be core to their business or their ways of working. But that era is surely drawing to a close. Digitally designed, data-ready structures will be able to achieve the kind of performance gains that meet sustainability targets, lower costs, and raise revenues from users.

76,Resilience in health is more than the facilities alone,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/resilience-in-health-is-more-than-the-facilities-alone,,"‘The world's 15 hottest sites on Tuesday were all in Australia’ was the news headline last summer, with most of the country sweltering in 45+C degree heat. The preceding winter saw the earliest ever start to the fire season, and the entire state of NSW declared in drought. Extreme weather events with far reaching impacts - including damaged or disrupted health care services - are challenging us more frequently. It’s crucial that health facilities, systems and people can absorb these disturbances and function in crisis scenarios, providing continuity of service. This is holistic resilience at a broad scale. While the health industry in recent years has made great gains in designing buildings to mitigate impacts of flooding, earthquakes, ensure water supply and back-up power and so on, even greater gains can be made now by widening our understanding of resilience and factoring it into health projects. Physical place – design for the future Disasters can disable facilities exactly when they are needed the most – during blackouts and heatwaves. Ensuring facilities are resilient and services can be maintained during extreme events involves understanding and anticipating the changes in climate that may lead to additional exposure of individuals (patients, staff and general public), systems and the infrastructure. Sydney’s new Westmead Hospital is a case in point. Integral to achieving its status as a post disaster facility was analysing all potential disasters and their impact. Getting the right people together to determine what post disaster meant to them, what needed to operate and function and how each facility would respond post disaster was integral to informing the built design. It enabled Arup’s electrical engineers to align the design with clinical goals. The remarkable new Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital on the waterfront in Boston is another great example of designing for future climate. It’s one of the most resilient hospitals in the world, incorporating dozens of features – redundant power and heating systems, superb daylighting, operable windows, protection from rising seas – that not only make it resilient to flooding, but well prepared to cope with many other predicted impacts of climate change. The building can maintain critical life-support conditions in the event of extended loss of power, heating fuel or water (passive survivability). Building organisational leadership and resilient people However, resilience in health is more than the physical spaces and facilities. It is also critical to build resilient organisational leaders to ensure the people working in them are prepared for the impacts on their physical place and operations, including the increased demand for services during extreme events. If leaders, staff and organisational structures aren’t resilient, the system will break down – no matter how resilient the building. If the lone facilities manager doesn’t come to work because their house has been flooded, who will sort things out when they go wrong? If the system fails - what happens, who do you go to, what backups are in place? Is there a culture that can respond when the system goes down? Enhancing the adaptive capacity of individuals, organisational structures and leadership can help minimise or mitigate negative impacts when systems fail in crisis events. By creating resilient organisational structures, a culture of understanding and appreciating risk, and being proactive about anticipating and responding to different shocks and stressor events, the organisation can continue providing its core services and supporting its communities. The Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH), Canberra Hospital, and the Community services climate resilience program for the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services are evidence that the industry is embracing this holistic approach. They show upfront design for resilience and assessment of scenarios at a broader level, an understanding of levels of organisational resilience, how staff get to work, what challenges might they experience during a crisis event and how to build individual and organisational capacity to respond. Royal Adelaide Hospital, South Australia For the RAH, a number of trials and scenario simulations were mapped well in advance of the commissioning and transition phase so people, processes, systems and the facility were ready on day one to respond to a disaster or extreme event. The team practised detailed scenarios – how patients might arrive, how staff would respond to a surge of patients, involvement of Emergency Services, and the role of the Emergency Response Team as well as decision-making protocols. The patients’ journey and interfaces with clinical workflows and support services, systems and the facility were simulated by staff and volunteers as ‘actors’. We are on the right path The road to resilience in health is complex with many challenges for the industry: staffing rural locations, funding for front line services, short term planning, unknown future technologies, procurement and operational structures (although recent changes will see great benefits in facilities’ quality, making them easier to maintain). The list goes on. Despite these challenges, great strides have already been made and we can achieve even greater outcomes by adopting a broad holistic view. We are already on the right path, with sustainable and resilient design receiving more attention in early healthcare project discussions. We need to continue to make buildings flexible with the ability to re-purpose with minimal expense. But we can achieve even more by creating resilience in the rest of the health network – systems, organisational structure, the culture and people. Extreme events will catalyse change in health and there are significant opportunities for the sector to lead a transformational agenda of holistic resilience planning in the face of these climate challenges."
77,"The 10,000-year hall pass ",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-10000-year-hall-pass,,"The last 10,000 years has marked a period of unusual climate stability during Earth’s history. What we have always accepted as the “norm” has actually not been normal at all. As it turns out, geologically-speaking, change is NOT the new normal – stability is. And now that is coming to an end. While this recent period of relative stasis has been well-known within the geological community, it wasn’t until others such as Elizabeth Kolbert, a journalist, and William Nordhaus, an economist, introduced it to a wider audience, bringing a greater appreciation to the role that stability has played in allowing the human species to flourish and civilizations to thrive. The seemingly abrupt shift back to a period of climatic instability has been significant enough that scientists have classified it as a distinct geologic epoch. Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer recognized this trend and coined the term the “Anthropocene” in 2000. The term is used to demark the increase in climate variability which has been traced back to the start of the Industrial Revolution. The term ""anthropocene"" has been used to demark the increase in climate variability which has been traced back to the start of the Industrial Revolution. However, some are now arguing that perhaps the new era is more accurately termed the “Capitalocene” (originally coined by Andreas Malm in 2014) to account for the socio-economic drivers of the industrial era as being the main drivers. In general, the argument is that capitalism (or some prefer the more inclusive concept of consumerism) created climate change through the increase in pollutants and resource denegation associated with the rise in technology. The natural impacts of this imbalance – melting ice sheets, intensification of storms, severity of droughts, sea level rise, etc. – are the by-products of this but not the root cause. It was the socio-economic drivers associated with consumerism that caused the issue in the first place. In the end, it may be closer to the truth to say that one necessarily influences the other. That the Earth has a finite number of resources which have to be allocated in certain ways to maintain the right balance to support human life. We as humans have the ability to fundamentally shift that allocation. The question becomes just how much the system can be stressed before it crosses a fundamental threshold. The key theme in all of this is that we have failed to assess the true value of the world. At the end of the day, what really matters is access to natural resources – principally water to drink, food to eat and air to breathe. However, traditional measures of wealth, such as GDPs, either heavily discount nature or effectively exclude it. This means that the value of having a livable planet is not accounted for, nor is it necessarily accommodated, in our traditional measures of what has value. Barrons recently published an article that further underscores this disconnect with the very apt title of: “It still makes good financial sense to burn the globe…”. The piece outlines how current market valuation is undermining our ability to address climate change in meaningful ways. Key points include: (1) the market’s short-term focus with little consideration of long-term risks; (2) using the past to inform the present and future growth, thereby discounting climate change; and, (3) the recognition that current price signals do NOT reflect all available information since the cost of carbon is not considered. Mark Carney (chair of the Financial Stability Board) was credited with naming this impending crisis as the “Climate Minsky” moment, riffing off the work of economist Hyman Minsky who showed how banks were overstretching their means before the 2008 economic crisis. Scene from an Extinction Rebellion protest. The group promotes non-violent rebellion against governments for climate and ecological justice. So how do we right this ship in time? Just last week the Global Commission released a report on climate adaptation which started to layout the “value” of climate resilience in investment-oriented terms. It reported that investing $1.8 trillion over the next ten years would yield $7.1 trillion in net benefits – a large portion of which would be recognized through avoided costs. The report’s unveiling times well with the upcoming UN Climate Summit where resilience and adaptation, including solving for the funding gap, are primed to be key focus areas. Elsewhere there are rays of hope that markets are preparing for a meaningful shift including the widespread adoption of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure initiative, an ESG market that covers $20 trillion in investments, a Green bond market that is estimated to be $100 trillion, and a nascent but growing Climate Bond market of $160 billion. If we are to have any hope of making a transformational change in this space, we need to recognize the true value of nature and it’s absolute essence to our survival. We’ve had a 10,000-year “hall pass” which has allowed us to develop incredible technologies and advancements in knowledge. Our next challenge is to leverage those hard-won gains to maintain a viable habitat for the human species. To put it in perspective: 99.9% of all species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct. What will our species do differently to beat those odds?

78,Integrated planning for complex cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/integrated-planning-for-complex-cities,,"Why are cities important? An oft-cited UN projection is that by 2050, two-thirds of the world’s population will reside in cities. That’s just about one generation away. Today, some 55% already live in urban areas. These figures underline the importance of cities to people: their quality of life, experience of living and working, as well as potential for growth, are inevitably influenced by what cities offer and provide. Without cities, there would not be the development of art, literature or science as we know it. There would not be the invention of steam power and electricity, nor industry and machines, nor the internet. Without cities, it is unlikely there would have been the famed repository and culture bed of knowledge that was The House of Wisdom in medieval Baghdad, nor Shakespeare’s plays, nor would we have astrophysics today giving evidence-based explanations of the universe – plus, of course, plagues, crime, pollution and dystopia. Clearly, with cities being the cradles of human civilisation and the prospect of the vast majority of people living their lives in cities, the quality of cities becomes fundamentally important. Two aspects of cities Modern cities have physical infrastructure – roads, rail, water and sewer pipelines, transmission lines, petrol stations and so on. Naturally, the larger a city’s population, the greater the quantity of physical infrastructure in terms of kilometres of pipelines or the number of petrol stations. However due to economies of scale, physical infrastructure does not need to be increased in direct proportion to population growth. For instance, studies have shown that if a city population was to double, the number of petrol stations or total length of roads need only increase by about 85% instead of 100%. (See Geoffrey West’s 2017 book, ‘Scale’). What is more interesting, however, is when it comes to socioeconomic measures like the number of patents and professionals, or wages, GDP and crime rate in a city: the increase is greater than 100%. Thus, a doubling of city population leads to an increase of about 115% in the number of patents achieved by the city. Agglomeration leads to a ‘superlinear’ increase in socioeconomic output. But clearly, just growing a city’s population is insufficient by itself. A city has to provide the conditions for people to be mobile, network and exchange information, services and goods. The two aspects – physical infrastructure and people – are deeply linked. A poorly planned, unliveable city will not facilitate superlinear contributions from its people. People are a city’s essence. Malaysian cities will continue to grow. How can we address the important link between a city’s physical and communication infrastructure and how that enables its population to thrive and be happy? One answer is to strategise, plan, develop and implement city plans in ways that are holistic, consonant with the way cities are necessarily complex, multi-layered and integrated. Indeed, it could be argued that a proper, holistically planned city might even enhance positive indicators such as patents and number of professionals while reducing the superlinearity of indicators like crime and poverty and, most important of all, resource and environmental degradation. Integrated City Planning Cities are, by definition, many sided. There are aspects to do with governance and administration, other aspects to do with transport, infrastructure and land use, and yet others with socioeconomic conditions, resilience and general liveability – all underpinned by sustainability. Quite typically there will be departments in a city’s administration that are assigned jurisdictions such as planning, traffic, transport, health, waste management, buildings, drainage and the like. These jurisdictions do not necessarily work seamlessly and they run the risk of compartmentalisation. Thus, it is unlikely to find, say, an office or department of integrated city planning. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. It is clear that cities and their master plans are multi-faceted. They are complex and multi-disciplinary. To be meaningful, their planning and implementation need to be integrated across many jurisdictions and benchmarked against other cities and the future. Governance by jurisdictions is in various ways an efficient way of dividing up the many areas and levels of work and managing them efficaciously. But it can easily happen that the framework that administers by departments extends also into city planning and implementation without an integrated platform. But the nature of a city is that its many aspects are interlinked. How do we link transport with urban transformation, land use, opportunistic funding and social housing? How do we establish and implement policies to ensure that transport and related projects comply with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and reduce car use? How do we create urban neighbourhoods that are attractive and enhance liveability? Clearly, it cannot just be engineers and planners, important though they will be. They will need to be joined by people with knowledge and experience in city economics, urban design and planning, sociologists and resource planners. Equally, they should also be joined by city advisers and urban designers who can give guidance on, say, the planning of innovation districts and mixed neighbourhoods that attract talent. Or perhaps who will see a cultural advantage to, say, planning for a local partnership with an international design and art museum. Importantly, the team must include sustainable development experts. Indeed, prior to all this, we would do well to ask in the first instance, what sort of future city vision do we want? In which case, we might involve people whose work and research it is to understand the present and investigate the future and, thence, provide foresight. Foresight and scenario testing would help governments decide on a vision for which strategic advice could be sought from strategy advisers. Any aspiring global city cannot properly plan without a strong eye to technology change. But therein lies the pitfalls. Where do we start? What challenge are we really trying to solve? What kind or level of technology planning and enablement do we need for the vision we have? This question is important because the technologies on offer are beguiling. It is all too easy to embrace much more than we actually need and, hence, eventually pay more. Technology vendors provide ready-made answers, but would an independent digital consultant that helps to underpin a city master plan be better placed to advise on the appropriate technology and vendors according to a city’s needs and budget? What about our hot and humid Malaysian weather which is neither walking- nor cycling-friendly? Yet it is recognised how liveable and attractive cities are often walkable. Is it possible to plan our tropical cities and transport links with attention to walkability and accessibility? The answer is yes. Environmentally sustainable consultants can model walkways and cycle paths with designed shading and ventilation features that optimise walkable conditions of temperature and humidity. Such considerations can be incorporated into city planning. Finally, can governing and administrative agencies be supported by capacity-building so that they are coordinated in implementing the objectives of an integrated city master plan? The challenge of able and coordinated implementation of an integrated city plan is not something to be underestimated. It is clear that cities and their master plans are multi-faceted. They are complex and multi-disciplinary. To be meaningful, their planning and implementation need to be integrated across many jurisdictions and benchmarked against other cities and the future. The inherent multiple dimensions cannot be properly addressed by limited or single-system approaches."
79,Transforming urban consumption,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/transforming-urban-consumption,,"By now some of you have heard about The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World (The Future of Urban Consumption), a report recently released by C40 Cities which reveals that the world’s urban centers are much bigger drivers of global carbon emissions than previously understood. Developed for C40 by Arup, in cooperation with the University of Leeds, the report looks at cities’ carbon impacts through the lens of what they consume, providing a much more complete picture of the role urban centers play in driving global carbon emissions. The report found that, by themselves, the C40’s 94 member cities account for roughly 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Still more sobering is the news that if we don’t take action now, those emissions will almost double by 2050, putting us that much closer to exceeding the 1.5°C temperature threshold for averting the worst consequences of climate change, as set by the United Nations in 2018. These findings have been startling, even to some actively working in the realm of climate change, because rather than simply advancing existing research on urban emissions, The Future of Urban Consumption redefines the scope of the problem. Up until now, city-based emissions were calculated using a “production-based” model that measures only those emissions generated inside a city’s geographic footprint. When C40 asked Arup to help them understand the true scope and scale of urban impacts, the decision was made to develop a model capable of measuring all emissions driven by a city’s activities, regardless of whether they occur within city boundaries or beyond them. Rather than only factoring in the emissions price tag of trucking your new pair of straight-leg jeans from the warehouse holding pen in Queens to the store in the West Village and the cab ride back to your apartment in Morningside Heights, as the production-based model does, the consumption-based model also accounts for the emissions generated by growing the cotton they are made of in Thailand, sewing them in China, and the net emissions produced by transporting them through the entire supply chain. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. The consumption-based emissions detailed in The Future of Urban Consumption are far more accurate than past estimates and, arguably, more alarming. It’s important to keep in mind, however, that these findings don’t change the facts on the ground, they simply give us a clearer view of the landscape. What the report makes starkly apparent is that global systems are fundamentally interconnected and our actions at home have far reaching effects. Cities around the world have long recognized that they have a role to play in staving off a climate crisis and organizations like C40 are already actively working to make change. What this report demonstrates is that high income urban centers, like New York, Houston, and Los Angeles, have an even greater opportunity to drive progress than previously understood. Real progress will depend on our ability to radically transform city consumption patterns over the next 30 years and city leaders will be critical to this effort. Facilitating such large-scale change might sound daunting but consider how drastically urban consumption patterns have shifted in past thirty years. The Union of Concerned Scientists reports that half of all industrial greenhouse gas pollution has been emitted in the past three decades, as a rising global middle class has embraced modern conveniences, like single-use plastic, fast fashion, ride sharing, and overnight delivery services. The challenge we face now is finding strategies that preserve improvements in quality of life and foster continued development while also safeguarding the planet and its resources. Change is already underway. Some cities are now collecting the data necessary to map out their global carbon footprints to determine where decarbonizing strategies and technologies can be applied to greatest effect. Here in the US, New York and Los Angeles are tracking the emissions generated by the ships and airplanes that carry goods and people to their borders, for example, as is Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. With sustainable research continuously advancing, cities have a host of emerging technologies and innovative operational and structural solutions to draw from as they strive for greater efficiency. For instance, New York City’s Hunts Point recently harnessed circular economy principles to help reduce the environmental impacts of food, a major driver of emissions. The Bronx neighborhood, which is home to one of the largest produce markets in the world, will soon open an anaerobic digester that transforms food waste into energy — a great example of how one system’s refuse can become fuel for another. Many city leaders are also looking to researchers to help them drive innovation in the sectors associated with the highest consumption-based emissions, such as fashion and food production. To empower urban farmers and help transform the food production model, the HARVEST research initiative brought together researchers at the MIT Center for Complex Engineering Systems and the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology with Arup sustainability experts and the agricultural technology innovators at Freight Farms to develop the first plugin for urban food production. Recently launched, the plugin allows users to estimate the crop yield potential of different types of urban farms, as well the energy and water use, and carbon emissions entailed in production. To get where we need to be – to avoid hitting, or over-stepping the 1.5 degrees C temperature threshold – city leaders will need to work in concert with the private sector to facilitate systemic change. They will need to proactively seed and shape new markets and leverage social trends potentially thought to be outside their domain, like online shopping. By embracing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and other tools for equitable, holistic change, city leaders can drive decarbonization in ways that benefit their communities, their economies, and the world at large. Transforming urban consumption will be a major undertaking, it’s true. But large-scale change can be achieved more quickly than we think. We’ve seen dramatic shifts over the past three decades, and we can already see the potential for equally dramatic, positive shifts in the decades ahead. Publication The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World This report explores how cities consumption-based emissions need to reduce to avoid a climate breakdown and focuses on six sectors – food, construction, clothing, vehicles, aviation and electronics Download"
80,Towards a more sustainable future,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/towards-increasingly-sustainable-development,,"Our patterns of development are unsustainable. Over the last 50 years, living conditions globally have improved, lifting millions out of poverty and generating wealth and prosperity for many. But inequity has increased, and the health of our planet has suffered. Increasing urbanisation, unsustainable production methods and growth in consumption mean we’ve reached a tipping point where we are running out of resources and exceeding planetary limits. Biodiversity is dangerously depleted; our oceans are acidifying and polluted with plastic; and climate change is no longer a threat but a crisis. “ The Earth does not belong to us. We belong to the Earth ” Neil Armstrong Designing our future Sustainable development means recreating a balance between the needs of a growing world population and the finite resources and health of our planet. No one claims this is easy. It will require transformational change in every aspect of society globally, including how we think about and design the places where people live and work. The built environment plays a fundamental role in creating a sustainable future, involving many of the 17 SDGs. Buildings and infrastructure are essential in enabling communities to survive and thrive by providing essential services, protection from the environment and enabling the flow of goods, services and knowledge that is essential to economic activity. But their construction and operation use vast quantities of materials and energy. Buildings and infrastructure negatively impact air quality, biodiversity and water resources; and currently are responsible for 38 per cent of global energy-related emissions. We need to find a better way. Green building design and beyond It has been almost 20 years since Beddington Zero Energy Development demonstrated that development was possible using only renewable energy generated on site combined with energy-efficient systems, the recycling of grey water, and rainwater harvesting. Eco-efficiency is now standard practice on building projects. See Tanjong Pagar Centre, the tallest building in Singapore, and the National Automotive Innovation Centre in the United Kingdom. Projects like these typically exceed building-code requirements in terms of performance and progressively redefine best practice. But achieving the UN SDGs requires more than incremental improvements in green-building design. Our focus must shift from minimising social and environmental impact to providing long-term social, environmental and economic value. Sustainable development requires us to think harder about why we are building, for whom, and how their need might evolve over time and be met in other ways. If we are to achieve lasting positive outcomes for society and the planet, we need to move away from conventional design that assumes there are limitless resources. We need to move towards regenerative development where there is a constantly evolving symbiotic relationship between human activity, physical and ecological systems. London Olympics 2012 park A new standard This has been the design philosophy behind Madrid Nuevo Norte, one of Europe’s largest urban regeneration projects. It will transform 300 hectares of industrial brownfields divided by rail tracks into a new people-friendly and ecological urban quarter characterised by green spaces, cycle paths and public transport. All this will create job opportunities and attract investment. It sets a new standard for sustainable urban development that builds on lessons learned from the redevelopment of Kings Cross, the creation of Olympic Park in London, and Cities Alive, an initiative to rethink how we design and manage cities. It brought people from different disciplines together to explore the benefits of green infrastructure, child-friendly design, walkable cities, nighttime lighting and reconnecting people with water to create healthier environments that will help drive social and economic success. Collaborating across disciplines Sustainable development requires us to join hands with others fighting for the same values, and work collaboratively across sectors and disciplines. We are adopting participatory approaches and engaging stakeholders throughout the value chain to co-create integrated solutions to increasingly complex problems. We are investing in partnerships such as C40 and the Ellen McArthur Foundation, where our knowledge and expertise is helping to accelerate a transition to net-zero carbon emissions and the application of circular economy principles in the built environment. Human ingenuity, creativity and collaboration combined with deep scientific knowledge made the seemingly impossible possible when we landed on the Moon. The same level of ambition and commitment is needed now to safeguard our planet, reverse climate change, end poverty, and ensure everyone can enjoy peace and prosperity.

81,A shift to shared control: five principles for urban renewal,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-shift-to-shared-control-five-principles-for-urban-renewal,,"This is taken from an article in New Planner by Tina Wang, Graduate Planner Arup Australasia; Hugh Gardner Cities Advisory, Arup Netherlands; and Kirsten McDonald Associate Principal, Arup Australasia. The challenges of urbanisation affect all city residents. In 2016, 35% of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lived in the capital cities of Australia. Renewal processes associated with managing city growth and economic performance are impacting urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Addressing the challenges of urbanisation in the face of growing uncertainty and increasing complexity requires the genuine involvement of all city residents, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, in ‘community led’ renewal. ‘Community led’ renewal has a positive impact on the urban system, strengthening communities, as well as the infrastructure, institutional and knowledge networks which support them. It is held up as a theoretical ideal. Few large-scale renewal programs in Australia deliver on the ambition of a community led process. Achieving a true community led urban renewal process requires a change from the current approach to the genuine engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples under conditions of shared control. Solving complex city problems requires us to acknowledge the possibility of shared control in the renewal process. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, shared control is linked to self-determination2 . Research3 suggests that meaningful engagement under conditions of shared control requires a set of agreed principles, which form a shared control framework, informed by the preferences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples themselves. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-led research into shared control suggests that five principles are key to achieving genuine engagement in urban renewal processes and the pursuit of self-determination. These five principles are: Respect means the building of trust through listening; through acknowledging and accommodating different values in relation to urban renewal processes and their outputs; through acknowledging the existence and rightful ownership of knowledge; through the creation of opportunities for meaningful participation; as well as by allowing time and providing resources to support involvement. Access means the making available to the rightful owners any knowledge elicited during urban renewal process; by enabling the rightful owners to retrieve knowledge at any time; and by making available project outputs that have been based on or informed by this knowledge. Possession means the connection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to their lands; the importance of this connection to the identities and cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and the need to obtain consent for planned changes to these lands. Control means the role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the design of engagement processes; and their right to control the use and dissemination of knowledge elicited through these engagement processes for the purposes of informing urban renewal. Ownership means the collective ownership by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of their knowledge; and the need to obtain community and individual consent for use of this knowledge to inform urban renewal. These principles suggest a renewal process with people and place-led thinking rather than built form-led thinking. Adoption of such principles is part of a shift from renewal through built environment controls to renewal through contemporary social and economic development approaches. New competencies are needed in the public and private sectors to make the change from current to this future practice. The opportunity to employ such principles exists with the emerging and prominent renewal processes brought about by Australia’s large infrastructure investments– for example Sydney’s Central Station. These processes will bring land use and economic ecosystem change. It is crucial to include in these processes genuine efforts to transition to a shared control model for local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, including the associated community-controlled organisations and businesses that are local and place-based. 1ABS 2016, Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia. 2The ability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural development. 3By organisations such as the Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub, RMIT University, and the Monash University Sustainable Development Institute.

82,Could modular construction spark a housing revolution?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/could-modular-construction-spark-a-housing-revolution,,"Modern methods of construction (MMC), also known as modular construction, offers the opportunity to rethink how we conceptualise, design and build much-needed housing. The design process provides an opportunity to speed up construction, make challenging sites viable, and provide varied and adaptable homes that respond to the needs of local neighbours and communities. Although MMC has tantalised the industry for decades, currently less than 10% of housing in the UK is built this way – despite an ongoing housing crisis and a need to build millions more homes in the coming years. Why? While research to date has focused mainly on the financial and technical barriers, there is evidence that the planning system is considered too rigid and unaccommodating for MMC. Publications How Modern Methods of Construction can deliver more through the planning system Our research has identified opportunities, actions and benefits to aid local planning authorities, developers, and manufacturers to facilitate the use of MMC. Download Smoothing the development management process MMC homes, using pre-agreed design specifications, could speed up decisions, streamline the rest of the process and reduce risk. Design codes can be used to set out a suite of design options which are all acceptable. These could be used alongside Local Development Orders to enable applications to be determined in as little as 28 days. However, this streamlined, risk-minimising approach will only be possible with a shift in the attitudes of some local planning departments. The advantages of a new MMC planning model will be eroded by planning officers and members seeking to alter designs. A pragmatic approach is also needed when applying planning conditions. Elevating the role of design and responding to place The principles of MMC are not new - off-site construction techniques have been used to efficiently manufacture performance-led dwellings since the late 1940s. The successful roll-out would depend on the homes being both desirable to potential residents and attractive to existing communities. This method of construction can deliver a wide range of house types and materials, massing, layout and detailed design can all be tailored to local context. With clever modular designs, new homes can also be adaptable and respond to changing needs, for example as residents become older. Giants like Amazon are already investing in technology-enabled, prefabricated modular housing, and companies like Tata Steel are developing housing systems that could provide quality, adaptable modular designs. This could enable us to upgrade our homes in much the same way that we upgrade cars and technology. Harnessing digital innovation A digital approach could provide mass customisation, which allows manufacturers to develop a wide range of homes using common components. By using online configurations to design homes, this method has the potential to revolutionise the way in which residents buy their future homes. The combination of digital infrastructure innovations and MMC has the potential to transform the planning system – accelerating the rate at which paper applications are replaced with designs direct from digital platforms. “ Imagine a system where paper driven applications are replaced with designs direct from digital platforms which are pre-agreed with the local council then sent straight to the production line ” Vicky Evans UKMEA Residential Business Leader Opportunities for partnerships to implement MMC at scale Partnerships are fundamental to delivering MMC to accelerate the traditional housing construction market. MMC needs a critical mass and those in the built environment including local authorities, developers, planners, public bodies – should look for opportunities to achieve this. To enable MMC to become an everyday delivery method, all parts of the housing system need to align - and planning is a vital component of this. Developers, manufacturers and local councils need to work together to change attitudes and introduce a streamlined planning process which has the potential to bring about real change in the industry.

83,Steps towards a more walkable Singapore,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/steps-towards-a-more-walkable-singapore,,"What else can we do so that people walk more in the ‘Little Red Dot’? Chances are you have seen the term ‘walkability’ – how friendly an area is to walking – as cities around the world gravitate to active mobility measures such as returning road space to pedestrians and developing more sustainable transportation modes. The clear benefits of walkability are uncovered in Arup’s report Cities Alive: Towards a walking world. Walkable urban environments can impact economies positively, boost tourism, improve public health and reduce traffic congestion. Singapore is no stranger to this concept with its urban design interventions, ‘car-lite’ strategies, campaigns encouraging commuters to walk, cycle and ride, and efforts to understand attributes beyond infrastructure to improve walkability. Yet there is much more to uncover, such as reasons why people might avoid walking short distances even if heat and humidity levels are tolerable. The weather is one, albeit major, deciding factor to walk to places – but what other factors and design interventions have Arup and the city explored, and what more could we do to make us stretch our legs and get moving? Half of Fullerton Road on Anderson Bridge has been turned into a footpath. Paving pleasant and delightful paths A project that illustrates a successful move away from a traffic-dominated cityscape is the rejuvenation of Empress Place and Esplanade Park. Arup helped to improve pedestrian connectivity and reduce traffic, moving one step closer to realising the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s vision of an arts and culture precinct in Singapore’s historic Civic District. This project involved calming traffic and creating a shared zone that returned road equity to pedestrians. Arup also did extensive traffic modelling and simulations to assure stakeholders that lane reductions would not deter visitors going to cultural venues in the area or impact traffic elsewhere. Today, Connaught Drive is halved from four lanes to two, while 50% of Fullerton Road at Anderson Bridge has been turned into a footpath. The transplanted heritage trees at Empress Lawn now provide an unobstructed space for events, and more shaded paths. Enhancing the attractiveness of, and things to do in, the public realm also influences walkability in an area. Arup achieved this by helping to beautify the streetscape and improve green cover. Working with arborists, we designed a system that helped transplant eight 90-tonne heritage trees to shade pathways, while creating unobstructed views at Empress Lawn. This flexible space allows pop-up events to take place – drawing people to activities, not just destinations, and helping to boost the area’s economic viability. Seamlessly connected, these green spaces, parks and streets in the precinct are now enjoyed for recreational and sport activities. The vision is to have more people out on the streets, meeting and interacting, not staying indoors. That is instantly more exciting – a scene that, when multiplied everywhere, would translate into a safer, more innovative and dynamic city. Best of all, it also makes people happy. Go green and get moving Beyond infrastructure design or measures to reduce private vehicle dependence, Arup is also privileged to work on projects that encourage active mobility, improve accessibility and bring people closer to nature and lush greenery. Labrador Coastal Walk, completed in 2012, features an ecologically sensitive design so visitors can enjoy mangrove and coastal views. Rower’s Bay, a node on the Round Island Route at Seletar, was launched this year. When progressively completed by 2035, the Route will feature more dynamic green corridors, connecting visitors by foot to many natural, cultural and historical attractions around Singapore. This 150km interlinking Park Connector Network will also support healthier mobility choices and more active lifestyles. Rower’s Bay, a new node along the Round Island Route, is connecting people to nature and supporting more active lifestyles. Communities can look forward to the North-South Corridor, the island’s first integrated active mobility and public transport corridor with dedicated bus, foot and cycling paths. This uninterrupted and pedestrian-first Transit Priority Corridor – a remarkable 21.5km long – will link up northern towns to the city centre, bringing together communities and improving connectivity between different towns. It is due to be completed around 2026. These projects are complemented with shorter public transport travelling times and improved infrastructure and mobility ecosystems: enhanced last-mile facilities and more end-of-trip facilities in workplaces such as bicycle parking, lockers and shower rooms. In creating better streets, not roads, Arup hopes to shape a future environment where people are inclined to adopt active mobility choices and have less hesitation getting out and about on foot. Create better streets, not roads There is more to learn about challenges with climate, traffic and pedestrians’ attitudes in Singapore, but there are positive signs of increasing receptiveness towards walkability. Government campaigns to support a more active Singapore and more suitable infrastructure are encouraging people to walk to places. We also see changing design trends prioritising people over vehicles. Meanwhile, Arup is building on the ‘Cities Alive’ research, refining indices and parameters to create a more tailored framework for measuring walkability, particularly in tropical environments. Our new urban walkability score uses 30 parameters to measure walkability and uncover remedial and action plans in a chosen area. Guided by five overarching principles – social, infrastructure, environmental, economic and political – this scoring framework is informed by a qualitative and quantitative mix of open-source data and spatial analytics, benchmarked measurements and questionnaires. The next phase of our walkability study will involve compiling best practices, formulating guidelines and policy recommendations. We also continue to study pedestrian profiles and define street design elements that are suitable for walking. In creating better streets, not roads, Arup hopes to shape a future environment where people are inclined to adopt active mobility choices and have less hesitation getting out and about on foot."
84,What does an age-inclusive city look like?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/what-does-an-age-inclusive-city-look-like,,"Densely populated, noisy and exciting, our cities are often a model of youthful exuberance. But as our lifespans extend it’s becoming clear we need to do a better job of designing cities that work for the old as well as the young. People are leading longer lives, and we need the built environment to respond to the changing needs we have during each phase of life. For architects, engineers, city planners and decision makers, truly progressive design must start to mean considering the diversity of users their work touches. And that includes the wide-ranging needs of an ageing population. In the latest Cities Alive publication Designing for ageing communities we have attempted to define what an age-inclusive city should offer. We know people are going to want to retain their autonomy and independence. Their health and mental wellbeing will become increasingly important. Social connectedness will be vital to a long life. And they will need to live and move around in safety. Putting all four factors together is a good starting point for a new design ethos. Publications Cities Alive: Designing for ageing communities This report identifies the specific needs of older people and proposes strategies and actions that cities can take to make communities more age-friendly. Download Lives built to last Typically, a client will require that a piece of infrastructure is functional for a certain number of decades. But age inclusivity challenges designers to think differently; perhaps we should now start to consider the lifespan of the users themselves too. How will their needs change as they age? Will the building or asset still be as easy to use, to heat and light, to enjoy? What might its uses tomorrow mean for its design today? The new report identifies dozens of actions, forming an age-inclusive ethos that we will need to design a built environment in which older people can continue to thrive. Watch: Designing for Ageing Communities presents key strategies and actions for adapting our urban environments to better address these wide-ranging needs.

In Birmingham, England, a municipal trust has designed and developed adaptable housing that anticipates elderly residents’ possible lack of mobility, keeping essential functions on the ground floor, so that upper floors can be retained for caregivers or family visitors. “ The design of the spaces where we live, play and work should intentionally foster regular interaction across the generations. Such spontaneous encounters are not only mutually-beneficial, but they can also help combat the ageist attitudes that prevail in many parts of the world today, offering the potential to nurture a cultural shift in how people think about age and ageing. ” Stephanie Firestone Senior Strategic Policy Advisor, AARP Residents at Kampung Admiralty Kampung Admiralty, Singapore To ensure older people are socially connected and healthy the Kampung Admiralty residential development in Singapore was designed with supporting functions like a health centre, supermarket, bank, and day care centre on site. This has meant that older residents can lead richer social lives, help out with childcare and enjoy a number of other recreational options without having to travel great distances. This ‘whole community’ vision is the essence of a truly sustainable neighbourhood and represent a solution that works for all ages, from child to parent to grandparent.

85,People must be at the heart of our thinking on future mobility,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/people-must-be-at-the-heart-of-our-thinking-on-future-mobility,,"Type ‘Future of Transport’ into Google, and you’ll be inundated with automated vehicle technology in the air and terrestrially. The only people you will see are in artists’ impressions of fantasy-style moving lounge rooms as we give up driving to the robot. Something may be amiss in our thinking. Many of our best minds are working on how we’re going to replace a driver, but we need to not lose sight of the reason why we are doing this. Focusing just on the means of movement in the future is putting the cart before the horse. That’s because people have certain needs that have to be met in order to thrive. Maslow’s hierarchy is a useful structure for thinking about those needs: people need to be able to access goods and services. They need to feel safe. They need to connect to others – both friends and strangers – and they need to feel connected to their environment. In essence, transport is a derived need – we need it because it’s the thing that enables us to meet all our other needs. We must always ask why – before how – because you can’t answer detailed project questions without understanding the bigger picture. When it comes to the future of mobility, transport planners must first understand the people we’re serving and what they need before we can start answering how we best serve them. We need to know what access they need to the rest of the community, and which goods and services from the community need to be able to reach them. As consultants, our advice is often sought once a project or a solution has been defined. To be really effective, we need to make sure we ask the right questions about people’s needs so that the big picture doesn’t go unasked and unanswered. I see a strong case for stepping back at the start of any project and working with the client and stakeholders to establish a ‘songbook’ from which to work – building up, together, from the base. We must always ask why – before how – because you can’t answer detailed project questions without understanding the bigger picture. I’m currently working on the City of Sydney Transport Futures project, which has been an incredibly collaborative process. The first phase is really exploring and engaging with the client to create a vision for the city and then understanding the challenges that people are likely to face in using the city. This involves profiling, analysing datasets to understand the size of various user groups and lots of spending time in the city to observe how its different parts operate at the moment. We’ve also held several workshops with City of Sydney people beyond the project team to help the city crystallise its thinking and build a shared understanding of what is needed. We’ve also been reaching out to other stakeholders. Now the City of Sydney has a strong picture of what it is trying to achieve and what successful transport looks like for the city. It is able to start trying to work with the State Government on how to make it a reality, with people very much at the heart of the future vision. It’s a model I hope to see become more and more common as we plan for the future of access and mobility."
86,What should a city sound like?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/what-should-a-city-sound-like,,"As we move away from cities defined by the clang of the industrial revolution and towards the emergence of mainstream electric vehicles, there is a chance to redefine the character of our cities. There’s an opportunity to pay more attention to what we want our cities to sound like – rather than accepting a future of what they will sound like by solely using a very blunt instrument of limiting noise emission. We can focus on the character of the soundscape. Currently, our urban centres are very much defined by road traffic and the industrial noise sources associated with buildings. However, there’s a real opportunity to be sculpting a future soundscape in terms of how we want it to sound. We can include sound as a resource, instead of a detractor, to sculpt soundscapes for urban spaces that resonate with people. At a policy level, there are emerging examples of soundscape being included in defining the future of our urban centres such as the City of London Noise Strategy 2016-2026 and the Wales Noise and Soundscape Action Plan 2018-2023. This shift in understanding is a fundamental building block. Designing - not just blocking - sound Traditionally, as acoustic engineers, our profession addresses noise problems or unwanted acoustic issues within a development, and that often involves mitigating against noise or reducing reverberance. The language that we use as designers is quite negative: it focuses on unwanted things, so there’s now an industry-wide movement to focus more on what’s been coined a ‘soundscape design’ approach. In 2014, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released a framework defining a ‘soundscape’. In simple terms, it’s defined as an acoustic environment as perceived by people in context. Part 2 of the ISO framework standard alludes to how we might be able to survey soundscapes in a finer grain detail to understand how we might be able to sculpt them. It includes guidance on how to obtain objective measurement data, including psycho-acoustic parameters, and also provides a suite of subjective survey questions to gain an understanding of how people engage with their acoustic environments. By surveying soundscapes and identifying acoustic applications to alter them, we can focus much more on designing urban soundscapes that are perceived in a positive way. Arup soundscape survey measurement rig, Circular Quay, Sydney Working with the framework It can take significant resources to adequately quantify soundscapes, and then sculpt and design them. At Arup, we are implementing the methodology to the ISO standard and then looking for opportunities to make it more accessible for acoustic consultants who don’t necessarily have the equipment or time to be able to undertake soundscape surveys. We see the need for a very accessible version for doing soundscape surveys rather than the traditional acoustic surveys that typically focus solely on measuring overall noise levels. Influencing attitudes Altruistically, there is a real opportunity for acoustic engineers and consultants to influence social attitudes towards our urban soundscapes. On a very fundamental level, we could change our language and move away from only using ‘noise’ as a descriptor for ‘sound’ or using the word ‘mitigate’ as the sole design opportunity. That would be a huge mind shift. This change is accessible for everybody, whether it’s a large engineering firm or a smaller operator.

87,Hitting the accelerator: building an electric vehicle charging grid for all ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/hitting-the-accelerator-building-an-electric-vehicle-charging-grid-for-all,,"Five years from now, low emission vehicles – predominantly electric vehicles (EVs) - will be transforming the streets of our cities… but only if these new vehicles have somewhere to charge. How can cities, infrastructure owners and transport authorities make joined-up decisions around EV charging infrastructure to reap the benefits of low emission vehicles? The right location Cities are densely populated. Owners of EVs won’t have driveways in which to charge their cars, and will need lots of public charge points – whether during the journey or at the destination. Applying our modelling and analysis to one UK city, we’ve estimated it needs to expand its existing charging network by 500% in the next five years to help it meet its aspirations for a cleaner, lower-carbon future. Across the world, from LA to New Delhi, every city faces this problem. So, where should these charge points be located? Preparing for plug in • Charging infrastructure is key to EV take-up and needs to support different road users with different behaviours. • On-street charging in residential areas will not happen at pace or scale. People without off-street parking need destination and en-route charging to convince them to use EVs. Let the data speak If everyone is to benefit from the coming EV revolution, city authorities urgently need to lead a collaborative effort to install the right number of charging points in the right places. A data-driven collaboration between different city bodies and stakeholders – transport authorities, regeneration teams and energy distribution network operators – will enable municipalities and local authorities to implement an EV charging network that works for everyone. City authorities already have access to data on socio-economic factors such as the types of housing in different areas, and to transport data that plots the origins and destinations of people’s journeys. Combining this data in a detailed model can provide a picture of how many charging points are needed, the types required for the likely mix of vehicles, the benefits that could be derived from charge points in different locations and the likely demands on the energy network. Modelling demand We’ve created a detailed model that combines socio-economic, housing, transport data, with EV adoption rates and vehicle performance data. These data points are brought together in a proprietary demand model to provide a detailed picture of EV charging demand through the day, across an entire city. This allows us to test different scenarios and create masterplans integrating EV charging demand, with charge point placement and grid capacity. Preparing for plug in • City authorities need to take a leading role in creating a joined-up plan for installing EV charge points, otherwise coverage will be patchy. And they urgently need a lot more charge points. • Modelling combines city data to help define the optimum number, type and location of charge points. Don’t leave it to the market Taking a network-wide approach is vital. Municipalities and city authorities could leave installing chargers entirely up to commercial charging companies. This is too important to leave to the market alone, or indeed to any single body. It’s not clear that the market will ensure a cross section of society has access to charging - firms could potentially cherry pick the most profitable locations. It’s also doubtful the market would investigate how electric buses (which Arup is studying for a city in the UK), could share their charging infrastructure with private cars. Charging infrastructure has implications for issues like air quality, decarbonisation and more broadly a city’s reputation, everyone needs to be involved. Ideally, local government creating an EV masterplan focused on achieving the widest-ranging benefits and supported by the whole community.

88,The human element in safer future roads ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-human-element-in-safer-future-roads,,"Today’s road design standards are based on assumptions about the type of vehicles using the road and the physical abilities of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. Our challenge is preparing for a future when fully automated cars are becoming the norm, but they must interact with analogue humans walking and cycling. We need to understand how important the human element is in our current design standards and in the millions of small, day-to-day negotiations between different types of road users. The human element is fundamental to the National Road Safety Strategy’s Safe System approach, which is built on the premise that people make mistakes, and that there is a limit to the human body’s tolerance to crash forces. The achievement of a Safe System is a shared responsibility and it requires four interconnected cornerstones of safe travel to be working effectively together: safer people, safer vehicles, safer roads and safer speeds. The eyes have it – non-verbal communication critical between road users Most of our streets rely on private vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians approximating the road rules in a relatively predictable way and making safe decisions when interacting. A key element of successful and safe interaction is the ability for road users to make eye contact. Ben Hamilton-Baillie, a UK street design specialist, noted that the use of social and physical context as a means to adapt traffic behaviour is critically dependent on speed and eye contact. In many streets and low speed environments, particularly shared zones, road user behaviour is controlled by personal interactions between street users, including non-verbal negotiation and social cues. Recent research from France confirmed that if pedestrians at uncontrolled pedestrian crossings make direct eye contact with oncoming drivers, the drivers are more likely to stop. Rising automation on the road network presents challenges, alongside opportunities, for the safe interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. What we need to think about, and what we need to do With the advent of fully automated vehicles, we may lose the advantage of eye contact between drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. While sensor design enables a look to be detected, the ability to interpret the look is a new facial recognition technology that requires field testing to be reliable. To lessen the impact, road and street designs should clearly reflect ‘movement and place’ functionality and, in highly pedestrianised areas, speed limits should drop. Pedestrians and cyclists mustn’t be isolated to the pavement while vehicles have free flow: the give-and-take of today must continue and be improved upon. Fully automated vehicles interpret the road environment differently and may be more ‘confident’ to travel at posted speed most of the time: a human driver may sense a lower speed is safer. For example, a driver seeing a balloon on a string pop out of a parked car may determine instantly that a child could be about to enter the roadway. Would an automated vehicle have the same interpretive skills? What of seeing an adult being distracted as a child exits? To counter this, we need to consider easily understandable conditional speed limits which can be followed by automated vehicles in areas where complex human interactions are likely. Traffic signals will need to be reviewed in light of danger that pedestrians may disregard them, safe in in the knowledge that AVs will yield. There is also a danger that pedestrians will disregard crossing signals, safe in the knowledge that fully automated vehicles will yield. To counter this, pedestrians must be well catered-for. Signal timings need to be reviewed to reduce pedestrian waiting times and we must provide additional formalised crossing sites in areas of high pedestrian activity. And sensors need to evolve to understand what is a feint and what is actual movement: this will require significant AI development. It is possible to maintain, and even increase, safety on our roads once fully automated vehicles arrive, as long as the human element is taken into consideration in the design of the streets and roads that will accommodate them. We need to understand that a precautionary approach will be required for a considerable time as people adapt to the machines which are adapting to the people."
89,Can the smart city be ethical with its data?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/can-the-smart-city-be-ethical-with-its-data,,"A world of increasingly self-aware buildings and transport, receptive to our every preference and wish, seems to promise a bright, sci-fi future. But as city governments and other actors embed all manner of sensors and data-gathering infrastructure in the public realm, new ethical challenges are emerging. The recent problems encountered by social media giants are instructive. Where a decade ago, people unquestioningly shared every thought and photo, now there’s more suspicion. The dawning realisation that ‘if you don’t pay for the service, you are the product’ and a series of large-scale privacy breaches are making people wary of who knows what about them. For city governors and politicians, this is a good moment to stop and consider the ethical structures they have in place for their use of public data. The addition of a data dimension to existing technology is another potential risk. CCTV is well established in many cities and largely accepted. One can imagine city leaders presenting the addition of facial recognition software as a way to promise a reduction in street crime… but without public debate and consent, you might also stoke fears of an eventual police state. Meeting the ethical challenge Technology cannot resolve our ethical quandaries. Public debate is vital to legitimise the ethical use of city data to which they contribute. Although the challenges around the use of data are still evolving, I believe a few key principles can already be defined: 1. Invest in governance. For cities, ethical digital governance will require investing in new skills and leadership, resourcing a team. As it stands, few cities are fully resourced to manage and control the new data gathered from the citizens they serve. Cities need to define a top-level strategy that includes policies on privacy and the ethical use of data. 2. Make privacy a priority. ‘Privacy by design’ as well as ‘security by design’ should be embedded in all services delivered by city government. The public should have the ability to give explicit and informed consent to data collection in the public realm. 3. Be honest about benefits and risks. When implementing new digital or data-driven services, be clear about the benefits… but also the risks. Eindhoven in the Netherlands deployed a raft of digital tools – WiFi trackers, microphones, cameras – to try to improve public safety in a city district, but the collection of personal data caused pushback from residents and visitors. There’s no trust without honesty about the data collected and used. 4. Incorporate ethical considerations into commercial partnerships. Cities do need to experiment and work with the private sector, as long as they share data in a fair way that respects ownership, privacy and the wider public good. New models of sharing data between public and private sectors are developing—the City Operating System in Barcelona is one such model, the Alphabet Sidewalk Civic Trust in Toronto is another. Cities will need to evaluate what might work for them in partnership with their partner ecosystems. They’ll also need to evaluate supply chain risks associated with data. Some companies may offer services where their business model relies partly or wholly on capturing citizen data. But as data sets get commoditised, or new regulations are introduced, maybe that service provider will no longer be capable of keeping the service going. And advertising-driven business models also might not be sustainable in the long-term. What happens if a service provider suddenly fails? 5. Use algorithms responsibly. As data-driven services grow, algorithms will play a larger role in decision making, picking winners and losers in new contexts. But placing this responsibility in mathematical rather than human hands poses new dilemmas. What are the algorithm’s biases? We can already see the pitfalls of these data-driven tools in the world of recruitment, where recruiters have been accused of automating bias, for example, by not rating candidates in a gender-neutral way. City authorities will face similar ethical challenges soon enough. Cities like L.A., Barcelona, London and Helsinki are starting to address issues around public data and trust. The trust factor Data-driven services and algorithm-powered decision making will usher in many exciting new possibilities for cities. But without ‘data trust’, advances in services are likely to stir new resentments and reduce faith in political leaders. Cities like L.A., Barcelona, London and Helsinki are starting to address the issue. Faith in political leaders depends on developing these ideas in ways the public understand and can engage with. The digital revolution will continue. The Internet of Things will grow deeper, more interconnected roots, generating more insights from infrastructure and services. Appealing devices may seduce us into giving up more personal information. The public needs to consider both what it wants and will tolerate. It’s a debate that must start now.

90,Smart cities have largely failed – here’s how Malaysia could succeed,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/smart-cities-have-largely-failed-how-malaysia-could-succeed,,"In the last 10 to 15 years, countless cities worldwide have branded themselves as ‘smart’, some as branding strategies, others as genuine attempts to leverage advanced technologies to improve traffic, enhance security, deliver public services online and create engaging public places. Yet years later, the results are underwhelming: unused technologies, unsolved problems, pilots abandoned halfway…Why? Tech-driven, not problem-driven In planning smart cities, governments and developers get distracted by tech fads without a preliminary understanding of the problems to solve. While drones and blockchain make for glossy marketing brochures, do they address pressing issues – and can these issues be tackled without technology? Implementation is messy Technologies that work perfectly well in labs rarely do so in the real world without significant investments in integration, training and process improvements. While a technology which regulates traffic is useful, it may require expensive integration with legacy systems, continuous staff training and an overhaul of how transport authorities monitor and influence traffic. Technology is just the tip of the iceberg. For it to work properly in a given environment, many other elements need to be properly re-designed. Money, money, money Investing in a smart city is an investment like any other – it needs a clear return, based on a sound understanding of both CAPEX and OPEX involved, value (savings, new revenue created) and most importantly, of who will be bearing the former and capturing the latter. As such, smart initiatives often involve a complex web of stakeholders and money flows that must be calibrated just right to be financially sustainable. However, this operational and money equation rarely receives proper attention. These complications explain why so many smart city projects rarely go beyond glossy brochures, or when they do fall flat. Rio de Janeiro is an example of a smart city success story that, in the end, shows the limitation of a technology-driven approach. Its integrated Command and Control centre earned the city a ‘World Smart City Award’ from the Smart City Expo World Congress in 2013. While the centre allowed for road monitoring and improvements in traffic, it has also been criticised for not addressing many of the critical challenges faced by the city (poor governance and rampant inequality, among others) and for being an exclusive and secretive initiative. Hidden behind high walls, the Command and Control centre does not share information with the public and it focuses surveillance on the most affluent portions of town. In addition, the centre uses hard-wired, integrated IBM technologies which are incredibly costly and complex to update overtime. Rio’s struggle to get the alchemy of smart city right is only one of the many examples of unimplemented ideas, programs abandoned halfway, or technology not having real impact abound globally. As they embark on their own smart city journeys, Malaysian cities like Kuala Lumpur and Penang have a unique opportunity to learn from their peers. As one of the global pioneers of smart city consulting, Arup has been behind the formulation of smart city strategies for many large cities worldwide, in Denmark, Australia, the UK and – more recently – Singapore and Malaysia. In 2015, Arup was a vision partner for the Singapore Housing & Development Board’s (HDB) Smart Urban Habitat Masterplan, and since June 2018 has provided digital masterplanning for Hunza, developer of the 43-acre Penang International Commercial Centre (PICC). PICC aims to be a green, smart and family-focused integrated estate in line with Penang’s Vision 2030. Drawing on Arup’s global experience, I have picked three key considerations that cities should look at to shape their vision and strategies for a smart masterplan. Less is more Arup initiates each project with an exploratory phase focused on defining what will truly make a city or a development unique. With the belief that ‘less is more’, we collaborate with clients to identify priorities to focus on. Should the estate be amazingly walkable? Is the city going to be defined by a strong community? Should this resort stand out for its unique digital experiences? These priorities give the focus needed to do things right. Experience and outcome-driven With priorities defined, Arup still does not address technology from the outset, but focuses instead on designing the experiences and outcomes that will achieve these priorities. For example, to increase the attractiveness of a shopping mall, Arup will work with design and landscape architects to define a series of experiences (augmented reality trails, therapeutic gardens, flexible work spaces) designed to turn the shopping mall into lifestyle hub, rather than a mere shopping centre. Design at this stage requires the collaboration of architects, engineers, landscapers and behaviour specialists to create revolutionary spaces and cities. Impact-focused When experiences are defined, then and only then can technology be explored, to understand how the right mix of solutions can enable the city’s vision. Rather than throwing fancy fads at simple problems, Arup believes in sound business planning, as well as partnering with private sector and technology partners. Why reinvent the wheel, when bringing Grab, Honestbee and FoodPanda in the right way and right places can truly enable smart experiences? Digital masterplanning is not about technology, and it should be integrated from the outset in smart city planning. By beginning with a clear vision of what their cities will be, planners can map out key strategies and digital initiatives that enhance both city operations and citizen experiences."

(Rockefeller Foundation: 2013). The City Resilience Index, developed by Arup with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, provides a comprehensive, technically robust, globally applicable basis for measuring city resilience. It is comprised of 52 indicators, which are assessed based on responses to 156 questions; through a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. The responses are aggregated and presented in relation to the 12 goals (or indices) in the Framework. Background Cities are subject to a wide range of natural and man-made pressures that have the potential to cause significant disruption, at their worst leading to cascading social breakdown, economic decline or physical collapse. Historically, urban risk management has focussed on understanding the impact of specific hazards and taking appropriate measures to mitigate risk. In recent years the growing diversity of hazards, increasing complexity of cities, and uncertainty associated with climate change, globalisation and rapid urbanisation has made building urban resilience into a critical agenda. The Index has been piloted in 5 cities: Shimla, India, Concepcion, Chile, Arusha, Tanzania, Hong Kong, China and Liverpool, UK. We are encouraging policy makers and other city stakeholders to use the interactive on-line assessment tool at www.cityresilienceindex.org and begin this vital analysis.

92,The shared city starts with more seats at the table,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-shared-city-starts-with-more-seats-at-the-table,,"It seems straightforward that a city should be built to serve all its inhabitants, rather than a select subset. Yet when those designing our cities reflect a narrow set of perspectives, it’s impossible to shape cities that enable everyone to thrive. For example, in the United States, only 25% of working architects, 20% of architectural school deans, and 15% of licensed American Institute of Architects members are women — and only 13% of engineers. At Arup, we are interested in what happens when you design cities that are truly meant to be shared. Women’s History Month offers an opportunity to engage in a conversation that is by no means new, but still both relevant and necessary. By hearing from and addressing the needs of often-overlooked populations, including women, we can build safer, healthier, happier, and more successful cities. To delve further into how cities are shaped and who they are designed for, Arup associate principal and logistics consultant Melody Ablola, Foresight and Innovation leader Francesca Birks, and planning policy leader Kate White weighed in on the bright possibilities of equitable design and what it will take to get there. * Inclusive design encompasses an improved quality of life for all — including aging populations, youth, people with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups. Why is gender equity a useful way to frame this conversation? Melody: Well, women hold up half the sky. For me, a meaningful approach to creating socially integrated communities means caring for and supporting half of the population. Oakland native Lillian Moller Gilbreth — one of the first females to earn a PhD and of Cheaper by the Dozen fame — focused on simplifying work tasks, creating a linear home kitchen design, and improving housework tasks so that women could seek paid employment outside the home. The fight for gender equity starts with design but has far-reaching impacts to improve the quality of life for everyone. Francesca: I hosted a panel at TEDWomen about designing cities for women, and one of the speakers, Laura Sydell, a digital culture correspondent for NPR, had interesting things to say about her experiences in Silicon Valley. Unsurprisingly, many tech startups are run by men, and Laura said that the things men focus on in building a company are not necessarily the things women might find important. Francesca Birks hosting a panel at TEDWomen on designing cities for women The way I envision her comment is that it’s like applying a different filter. Most architects, planners, and public agencies are still primarily led by men, so the investment priorities and what they identify as pervasive problems differ from what women would consider. The difference is in the filter they’re applying. Their filters are, naturally, driven by their experiences as men. A lot of things are scaled for men or are designed to be used by people in traditionally male attire — think overhead bins on planes, the height of water fountains, or staircases with transparent steps. Or how sidewalks are too narrow for wheelchairs or strollers — which are still primarily operated by women, although that is changing. Women might also feel more at risk while walking on poorly lit streets or waiting for unreliable transportation, which inhibits our mobility. Accessibility to green spaces and playgrounds is also important, as well as to decentralized childcare facilities. Kate: In the complete streets context, we note how if you design a sidewalk for ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] accessibility, it actually helps everyone, such as a dad pushing a stroller up the curb. I think similarly in terms of designing for gender equity. If you think about how women use buildings or public spaces, you’ll come up with design ideas that don’t just benefit women. It’s about adopting a broader, human-centered approach to city life. Since we’re living longer and our aging population has grown, it seems like this is another major design driver, alongside gender. How important is it to consider accessibility in terms of age? Francesca: There's a growing realization that we need to think and plan for an aging population. One of the challenges with older cities like New York is that a lot of infrastructure is old. The same could be said about aging accessibility as with designing women-friendly cities: you’d be designing better cities for everyone. I think 70 to 75% of the subways here in New York aren’t wheelchair accessible or walker accessible. Melody: Accessibility for our aging population is extremely important. Designers need to recalibrate for the needs of older communities to enhance their quality of life. I brought my mom to the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers and she has limited mobility, so it was great that there were facilities for wheelchairs. But on Sundays, the roads are closed in Golden Gate Park. To catch a Lyft, we had to slowly make our way to the edge of the park for pickup in the rain! People’s needs change over time, and thoughtful design — and operations — for all types of people allows for multifaceted communities to continue to grow and evolve together, which makes for better urban environments overall. That kind of design could be achieved through remote healthcare monitoring, grocery delivery services, or digital technology encouraging new ways of communication to support shifting abilities and levels of comfort as we age. What role will technology and data play in addressing critical equity issues in cities? Kate: Some solutions for data collection are actually low-tech. In her book, former New York City transportation commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan discusses the idea of “desire lines.” Everyone has routes and shortcuts, like cutting diagonally through a park, that they choose over the actual path. Simple human observation can allow us to understand what people want versus what designers think they want. There’s also opportunities for higher-tech applications as well. At Arup we’re trialing a travel-based survey app we’ve developed called Mobility Mosaic. Products like this can help stakeholders understand how much our transit is being used, and by whom, which can then inform better design and operations decisions. A ""desire line"" chosen over the actual path Francesca: I agree, technology can help us see where there’s high usage across different city infrastructure. Hopefully that can convince public officials and agencies that these are important areas to direct investments. Tracking in aggregate could also hopefully offer some real-time feedback. How was your journey? Horrible, great, unsafe, fun, there was dancing, who knows! How can community outreach and engagement help create more equitable cities? Francesca: Community engagement matters if you do it in a meaningful way — if you see it as a strategic and intentional exercise. You can’t use it as a check box. It should be a way to take feedback and redirect it toward the design of places, spaces, and systems. Hopefully, this will end up diversifying who has a seat at the table in terms of thinking about what should happen next, rather than just having one or a few individuals deciding for entire communities. Obviously, I also hope to see more diversity across the design industry professionals who are shaping our cities, but meaningful community engagement is another important way to ensure that different filters are applied to the design process. Kate: Exactly as Francesca says: it must be an inclusive, meaningful process. I recently heard LA Department of Transportation’s Destiny Thomas speak about “dignity-infused planning.” She says you need to meet people where they are. Partnering with community-based organizations that different demographic groups are already engaged with will allow for ease of outreach and feedback — instead of expecting a single mom to come to your workshop downtown at 6:30 on a Tuesday night. Melody: Absolutely. Community outreach helps those women, immigrants, and minorities who certainly don’t have the time or sometimes the language skills to communicate their needs. And these groups are so important in defining and shaping the problems that designers, architects, planners, and engineers need to address. No one should be left behind. Associate principal and urban planner Katherine Perez-Estolano at Arup's Advisory Services Forum What are the biggest challenges that we face in creating more inclusive cities? Kate: The housing crisis. I’m hopeful our leaders in California are addressing this issue with a dramatic increase in affordable housing, as we have so many people on the street. And Arup has a part to play. By designing more efficient cities that are transit-oriented and affordable-by-design microunits, now that family sizes are shrinking, we can have a major impact in developing a more inclusive city. Francesca: I completely agree. I think we’re seeing a tipping point in the real estate sector. We’ve been working with Brian Swett (Arup's director of cities and sustainable real estate) and the Urban Land Institute, the oldest and largest network of real estate professionals, researching how to integrate equity and wellness into their development investments. It’s amazing that we’re seeing this major network, which has championed sustainability for some time, taking up the equity agenda. I truly believe social equity lies at the center of our industry. If we don’t create inclusive environments and if we don’t have every community living healthily and sustainably, we’re all suffering as a result."
93,Arup’s Big Ideas for New York City,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/big-ideas-for-new-york-city,,"At Arup, we’re always on the lookout for new ways to “shape a better world.” In the New York office, we believe one of the best ways to do this is to start local and develop strategies that enhance the city we call home. In 2018, inspired by the London office’s campaign, “Ideas for London: Ten policy ideas for the Mayor of London,” we launched a new initiative to generate innovative proposals for enhancing New York City’s built environment. The Big Idea initiative invited staff at all levels of the organization to propose policies, projects, and reforms they believe have the potential to create positive change. The only rules? Each idea must be innovative, implementable, and provide benefit in one of the following six areas: growth, regeneration, life, resilience, digital, or operations. Below is a selection of some of the most farsighted, fascinating, and just plain smart “big ideas” proposed by our team. Eliminate trash on NYC sidewalks with dynamic waste collection pods Idea by: Gray Bender, sustainability consultant, energy, sustainability & building physics Category: City life Big opportunity With a thriving economy, safe streets, and a host of world-class public spaces, today’s New York is a modern metropolis. The contemporary city has little in common with the grimy city depicted in 70s-era Hollywood classics like Taxi Driver, with one major exception: the stinky mountains of trash that can still be found strewn across city sidewalks. The problem is an inefficient trash collection system that relies on a combination of public and private sector collection agencies to cover multiple service areas, many of which border or even overlap each other. The result is confusion and an unsightly mess. Big idea The introduction of automated vehicles and smart city connectivity presents a perfect opportunity to modernize trash collection in New York City. The city could use the data generated by the Internet of Things to identify zones where trash is likely to pile up and then dispatch a fleet of AV waste collection pods to those areas. Each pod would serve as a place for buildings to store their waste ahead of collection day and could even help streamline recycling efforts by supporting waste stream separation. On designated collection days, the pods would be mobilized to transport stored waste to centralized NYC Department of Sanitation collection facilities, before returning to their designated locations. Parked at strategic locations throughout the city, these mobile dumpsters, or “dynamic waste collection pods,” could help keep garbage out of sight and finally give New York City streets the curb appeal they deserve. Water squares: urban parks that reduce flood risk Idea by: Amy Leitch, senior consultant, integrated planning Category: City resilience Big opportunity New York is called the concrete jungle for a reason: more than 70% of the city’s land area is covered with impervious surfaces, like roadways and sidewalks, which increase the risk of runoff and flooding during heavy rainfall. In addition to the environmental consequences, the city’s lack of greenspace has health implications. Today, 33% of NYC’s adults get less than the recommended amount of physical activity and the majority of those are concentrated in poor and minority neighborhoods with limited access to green amenities. With heavy rainfall forecast to increase in coming years, New York will have to make stormwater management a priority. The city should recognize this as an opportunity not just to address climate change, but also to enhance the lives of underserved New Yorkers. Big idea To make New York City more climate-ready and livable, we should follow the example of cities like Rotterdam and Copenhagen and introduce “water squares.” Water squares are multiuse green infrastructure spaces that help promote physical activity and community connection while also playing a critical role in flood prevention. They work by incorporating lowered sections that capture and drain rain from the square and adjacent areas. Water squares are also highly scalable and can be connected to form a larger network and help reduce the need for more costly drainage system upgrades. Transform Rikers Island into a center for autonomous vehicles Idea by: Denis Mani, senior planner, integrated planning Category: City regeneration Big opportunity The upcoming deactivation of the Rikers Island prison complex, a large and relatively isolated parcel of land, presents a unique opportunity for New York City to establish itself as a leader in a new field of applied science research: autonomous vehicles (AV). Big idea With Rikers Island opening to development in the next decade, New York is well positioned to become a pioneer in a field that is predicted to be a major economic driver in the future. An AV research center on Rikers Island would bring high-quality research jobs and investment funds to NYC. AVs take up space, and, unlike apps or even smartphones, their R&D facilities require large sites, which are hard to find in the city. The release of Rikers Island onto the market is a unique opportunity because it has the necessary size yet is too inaccessible for the rest of the city and therefore can’t be used for typical housing or commercial developments. The city has both the talent pool and financial resources to transform Rikers into the world’s top AV research and development center. To set the wheels in motion, city leaders could launch a competition inviting firms from around the world to present their design concepts. Create public observation decks to give all New Yorkers a better view Idea by: Mike Ernst, senior planner, integrated planning Category: City growth Big opportunity Unlike hilly cities like San Francisco or Rio de Janeiro, where a hearty hike can bring you breathtaking views, New York’s level topography provides few opportunities to take in the full breadth of the city skyline. Most people in search of sweeping panoramas are relegated to the city’s handful of observation decks. But gaining entry to these places doesn’t come cheap. A standard ticket to the World Trade Center, Rockefeller Center, or the Empire State Building runs between $30 and $40, a price steep enough to keep away many local users. Big idea The City could offer incentive zoning to encourage the creation of free, privately owned public observation decks to ensure that all New Yorkers have access to a better view. These incentives could include granting developers permission to build higher, provided they include a free, publicly accessible deck in their project. The precedent for this type of zoning already exists, with New York City currently using density bonus incentives to support the development of privately owned public spaces, like the Elevated Acre at 55 Water Street. As Moses Gates of RPA wrote in a 2015 New York Daily News article on the same subject, “The amazing feeling of seeing New York from on high shouldn’t be reserved for just tourists and the wealthy.” Mapping New York’s underground Idea by: Rich Bartholomew, designer, digital insight Category: Digital cities Big opportunity Underneath New York City’s streets lie complex layers of utilities and infrastructure, constructed over many decades by many different hands. For most people, this labyrinth of systems remains out of sight and out of mind. But for building professionals, New York’s invisible underground systems are often the riskiest, most expensive obstacles to development. Big idea By harnessing the power of data, we can digitally map New York’s underground. The first step would be for the city’s architecture, engineering, and construction professionals to adopt a universal data schema and establish a standard protocol for digitally documenting all systems revealed by street excavations. This would ensure that all information is captured within one cohesive, easily accessed model. With active and collaborative inputs from all stakeholders over time, the model would mature into a digital replica of the city’s underground that could be used by building professionals to identify a range of problems in advance of construction, leading to a potential decrease in costs and improved project timelines, among other benefits. Transform New York’s postindustrial canals into a vibrant urban waterfront Idea by: Alexander Van Hout, transportation planning engineer, integrated planning Category: City regeneration Big opportunity Unattractive, underdeveloped, and polluted, the land surrounding New York’s Gowanus and Newton canals continues to reflect a bygone industrial era, even as vibrant communities spring up in neighboring areas. Big idea With good planning, zoning reform, environmental remediation, and commercial incentives, these underutilized stretches of New York waterfront could be transformed into thriving urban spaces, featuring a mix of retail, restaurants, and public amenities that help further drive economic growth across New York City’s boroughs. New York City's Gowanus Canal The future gas station: a one-stop mobility hub Idea by: Maggie Dong Category: City growth Big opportunity The transportation infrastructure built in the 20th century improved New York City’s overall mobility, but also fundamentally disrupted the urban fabric. The advent of electric and autonomous vehicles promises to reshape transportation infrastructure and help restore some of our lost physical and social connections. However, much of the land available in the city isn’t zoned to accommodate the infrastructure needed to support these new types of vehicles. What New York does have in abundance is gas stations. The city is currently home to more than 760 stations, covering a total of 225 acres. Big idea Transforming gas stations into local mobility hubs could help New York prepare to meet future mobility demands without necessitating the construction of additional infrastructure. These sustainable local hubs could serve as electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle charging stations, autonomous delivery truck and droid distribution centers, rideshare pickup/drop-off locations, or even community gathering spaces."
94,Imagining a future city through immersive sound,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cooper-hewitt-imagining-a-future-city,,"From December 2018 through March 2019 the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City is hosting The Road Ahead: Reimagining Mobility. The exhibit presents 40 design projects inspired by the technologies that will change how we move people, goods, and services in the future and encourages visitors to consider how those technologies can make streetscapes safer, transportation more equitable, and cities more sustainable. As part of the exhibit, Arup created Sounds of the Future City, an immersive 3-D sound experience with three scenarios that invite visitors to imagine how cities might sound in the future as new technologies arrive in public spaces. Here, four of the key collaborators, Rachel Abrams, Chris Pollock, Léonard Roussel, and Raj Patel discuss the inspiration and creative process for this experience, as well as the power and impact of prototyping in design. * Q: There has been a lot of positive response to Arup’s installation in the Cooper Hewitt’s exhibit The Road Ahead: Reimagining Mobility. Where did the journey start? Raj: The idea started out simply: to use sound to help people better understand their experience of the city now, and then posit what a potential future experience would be like. But that’s a very lofty goal, and very high-level, so we had to go through a process of determining how we would convey that story to the public. It was a design question first — what are the influencing design factors that play a part here, and how do you bring those together? Chris: It was important to us that we embrace the overall message of the exhibit, both so our piece had context and so that we could reinforce that work on the part of Cooper Hewitt of posing some important design questions. From there, as Raj said, we started to ask ourselves: What do we want people to experience? What are we trying to have them think about and feel? What are we trying to provoke them to think about, and how far should we stretch the ideas? Raj: Absolutely — a very important part of this piece is to show the opportunities and the challenges for what the future could be like in a balanced way and instigate some critical thinking in people when they experience those potential futures. Léo: In that way, the setting for our experience was important. Early in the creative process, we decided to use a real location, where we could extend the experience out to the street after people leave the exhibit, so that they could experience the intersection in real life and really feel the weight of the questions we were posing. Q: So what happens next — once you have the idea, how do you move that into reality? Rachel: From the initial context to the actual design process, there were several constraints on this experience. One was the fact that we are simultaneously the introduction and the conclusion of the gallery experience, which, as Léo mentioned, was one of the main reasons we based the experience on the street right outside the museum. Another was focusing our knowledge and our thoughts around this vast future-facing topic to be accessible and relevant to a wide audience. We needed to use our expertise to not necessarily arrive at answers but rather to set out propositions — and we needed to do it in a way that is simple enough to be engaging to an eight-year-old encountering these questions for the first time and compelling enough to other experts from the design community. Raj: It’s a challenging balance. A lot of people talk about human-centric design today, but I'm not sure that they really understand or know what human-centric, or rather people-centric, design is. It’s about the whole experience, about the process as well as the outcome. I often challenge architects and designers that I'm working with — instead of asking what a project is about, I ask, “How do you want people to feel?” To get insight into user experience and to do real people-centric design, you have to design for the senses. To understand sensory design requires virtual and real prototyping to be effective. Sound is integral to high-quality design experiences. Our tools bring this to life in the design process across a wide range of industries that are essential to the built environment. Chris: This was a very collaborative process as well. The planning team developed those three scenarios, along with Rachel, who provided the narrative. Then we had to form a baseline: What does the city sound like today? How do we quantify that? How do we measure it, and use it, and record it as an asset we can use to create this realistic 3-D audio, this spatial-audio experience? From there, Léo and the team went out to do a series of captured recordings and observations to start that process to create a believable, immersive city soundscape. Léo: Because the intent of the piece is to pose relatable and persuasive questions to the audience, we need to trigger an emotional response using memory, which is a complex network of past experiences. So we created a realistic scene that obeyed the general rules and paradigms that street soundscapes are built upon — mainly that street soundscapes are layered on top of each other and have specific properties that can be described in terms of depth of field, granularity/singularity, trajectories, and content stationarity/variability. Playing with these four dimensions at once is a unique ability made possible by 3-D audio. All of this was storyboarded very carefully. We wanted to make sure that the emotional connection and the responses that people were having were instigated by sound. The visual component of this experience is almost exclusively informative — it provides grounding context for the audio experiences and poses the framing questions that introduce the wider theme of the exhibit. But it’s not as simple as just re-creating the existing audio of the street outside. If you are creating an audio experience to create a certain response in an audience or to posit important questions through that experience, you must be careful to build as close a reality as you can without overwhelming people. Depth of field: Sound-emitting elements are distributed on a spectrum of distances from close foreground to deep background. Granularity/singularity: Sound layers have different spatial distributions that are unable to be separated into individual source components, from sounds in the foreground to ambiance in the background. Trajectories: Sources of sound can move in space. Background layers are usually perceived as still, but the motion of middle-ground and foreground components is perceivable. Content variability/consistency: Audio content can be stationary or vary greatly in time — for example, a car can move through space, but its sound texture does not vary in time. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Raj: Yes, exactly. You can't make a full, realistic city because there’s too much going on. In a live situation where you’re on the street, your brain interprets all that audio stimulation and makes sense of it. If you hear the sounds of the street at the same level in an installation as you heard them outside, your brain won’t be able to process it, because you're inside and cognitively you don't expect that same level of audio stimulation. Rachel: As a design artifact — if we imagine that we have been commissioned to think about this for a city or a vehicle manufacturer, as a piece of prototyping — it’s about always trying to strike exactly where it’s high fidelity enough to where you've got just enough information in there to be plausible and that considers the constraints that the client is thinking about. Q: What are the major benefits of this type of prototyping? What insights can we learn? Rachel: The design enterprise is mostly about shifting from the what is to the what could be. Prototyping is essential to this speculative practice in all sorts of ways, moving designers from the potential to the actual. At the heart of the process, iterative prototyping is a way to test a concept, learn from materials, or solicit responses from target users to refine and commit to the form of a concept. Physical and screen-based prototypes also provide feedback, allowing designers to learn by doing, as they interrogate and focus on specific aspects of a deliverable. Even brief, simple prototyping with video and audio, like the scenarios we’re showing to Cooper Hewitt’s visitors here, can inform and enrich Arup’s projects, from interventions in a single street or at scale for a whole city. The power of prototyping is that it allows designers to rehearse ideas before committing to them at one-to-one scale, as well as communicate complex ideas and convey experiential outcomes to clients and collaborators. Sounds of the Future City was designed by Arup consultants and specialists Rachel Abrams, Willem Boning, Terence Caulkins, James Conway, Anthony Cortez, Casey Eckersley, James Francisco, Kelsey Habla, Sean O'Neill, Raj Patel, Chris Pollock, and Léonard Roussel."
95,Climate change: it's roll-up our sleeves time,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/climate-change-its-roll-up-our-sleeves-time,,"Paula Kirk, Arup’s climate change leader, talks about how pragmatic adaptation is now top of the corporate agenda. In October 2018, over 180 of the countries that signed the COP21 Paris climate change agreement ratified the rules by which the agreement would be implemented. A huge moment for the process. But, although political agreement on the targets and rules for meeting them is vital, it won’t in itself solve the climate change problem. I work in Ireland, a country that is currently falling two thirds short of its EU legislated target of reducing emissions by 20% by 2020. These issues are just hard, and often the nation state isn’t the most agile actor to take action on such multi-dimensional and long-term issues. Fortunately, I believe there are reasons for optimism, for at the city and business scale, pragmatic climate change action is already in progress. In cities, pragmatic climate change action is already in progress. Let the cities lead I’ve worked for over a decade with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a group of over 90 cities across the world who are not just planning for a climate resilient future, they are proactively taking steps to make this a reality. The city scale is a good one to work with: issues are apparent to populations who demand change. City politicians tend to be more engaged. Issues like air pollution, renewable energy, flooding and resilience to extreme weather are experienced in sharp definition, driving the political agenda. Importantly, we know a lot more. Satellite photos of receding glaciers fill the newspapers. Weather forecasts are full of hotter summers and harsher winters. And, today, we have over a decade of valuable multidisciplinary research to analyse and understand how cities and climate change are intertwined. As the world continues to urbanise rapidly, making better-informed decisions about investments in transport, energy, water and other vital infrastructure has become a realistic priority for city decision makers. Business steps up In my experience, future-focused businesses are taking a lead. Here in Ireland, Business in the Community has mobilised 43 pioneering companies to sign up to the Low Carbon Pledge (and Arup is among the signatories). Across every sector, we’ve been helping clients who see climate change risk as a real factor that will affect their future success. So, how do businesses make a start? We take a forensic approach, to reveal their exposure to the many interconnected aspects of climate change. A client might be in the property sector and need to respond to new regulations demanding zero emission buildings. They could be radically rethinking their use of materials like plastics or packaging. Or they might be trying to shift to digital tools to streamline deliveries, to reduce their vehicle emissions and operational costs. Whatever their product or service, in my interactions with businesses I see a new mindset emerging. Adapting to climate change isn’t about burdensome costs, it’s about efficient operations and staying competitive. And when doing the right thing becomes a business advantage, we have cause to be optimistic that the best ideas will spread. Our recent work for Meridian Water was an example of this new thinking. We worked with them to place realistic future climate impacts like potential flood risks in their overall development plans. Working at the urban scale, we’ve been helping many different cities to evaluate the threats they’re likely to face, and developing their own city resilience plans. “ Time is of the essence when planning for a climate resilient future. Individuals, businesses and cities need to come together now and start embracing practical change. ” Paula Kirk Director, Climate and sustainability Learning by doing Today, the engineers, environmentalists and planning and policy specialists I work with provide a carbon reduction and sustainability advisory service that simply didn’t exist 20 years ago. We’ve learned much as we’ve helped clients to measure and manage the risks and opportunities these problems present. The only way to tackle the issue is to stay imaginative, and bring scientists, economists, political leaders, business people and other experts together to generate new ideas, new business models and more responsible solutions. Bike share schemes have been implemented in cities across the world Beneficial connections Adapting to climate change provides opportunities to solve other problems or changing behaviours. For example, across the world, cities have implemented city cycle hire schemes to ease congestion and promote healthier travel choices, making cities more liveable. We’ve worked to quantify these benefits, generating the data that helps decision makers in city governments to justify introducing new schemes or expanding existing ones. Everyone agrees that climate change now requires that we roll up our sleeves and make difficult choices. But despite the scale of the problem, I’m optimistic. This issue is already spurring some of the most creative and rigorous thinking that individuals, businesses, and cities have ever had to undertake. With a collaborative and pragmatic approach, we can achieve the change we need.Discover more about how Arup is responding Get in touch Talk to Paula about ways to take meaningful action against climate change Paula Kirk Director, Climate and sustainability [email protected] +353 1 233 4455 Dublin, local time - 10:29pm Discover more about climate change and resilience Project 100 Resilient Cities As Strategy Partner, Arup helped ten cities to develop and release Resilience Strategies.

97,Planning liveable cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/planning-liveable-cities,,"Infrastructure Australia (IA) has identified six challenges and nine recommendations to support liveable cities in Australia in its most recent paper, Planning Liveable Cities: A place-based approach to sequencing infrastructure and growth. The paper was informed by research and interviews undertaken by Arup’s cities specialists across Australia. It calls for a fresh perspective to the ways city practitioners identify the right types of infrastructure in the right places, and encourages a rethink to governance, funding and community engagement mechanisms to deliver infrastructure and services to best meet the liveability outcomes of communities. Here, Justin Madden (Cities Leader VIC/SA) and Safiah Moore (Senior Planner NSW/ACT) review the paper and its context – the rapid growth of Australian cities. Capital cities welcomed more than 80% of Australia’s population growth in the 2016 financial year (ABS, 2018), requiring additional homes as well as infrastructure and services to suit our cities’ evolving community characteristics. Good planning and timely delivery of infrastructure and services are needed to ensure our cities are productive, healthy and enjoyable places to experience daily life. However, the current approaches to infrastructure planning and delivery are obstructing Australian cities’ pathway to liveable cities. Poor planning is costly too. IA highlights that, “to date, governments have not sequenced infrastructure and development well, resulting in congestion, poor amenity, disgruntled communities and more expensive and inefficient infrastructure networks”. Communities are increasingly feeling the strain of crowded, missing or inappropriate infrastructure. These experiences are overshadowing the benefits of growth and influencing recent national conversations on international migration. “ This paper is a timely discussion of ways that we can shift community experiences of growth. We look forward to exploring ways to best implement these recommendations with industry partners, government and the community. ” Safiah Moore Senior Planner In Planning Liveable Cities, IA unpacks the obstructions to timely infrastructure sequencing and development and present a series of recommendations (R) for change. The findings (F) highlight that planning and delivering appropriate infrastructure and services in existing urban environments is complex. Governance arrangements and funding mechanisms are inappropriate to deliver the right infrastructure at the right times, and ways to collect and share data and community participation processes have not yet evolved to operate in this complex environment. Competing or misaligned priorities of national, state and local government agencies are identified as an overarching challenge (F2 and F3). Importantly, with IA’s national remit, challenges and recommendations are considered Australia-wide. Establishing a “whole of government national vision for Australia” is recommended to guide decision making at a state, city and local level (R1). Across Australian cities, there are gaps in understanding the capacity of infrastructure networks. If data exists, this is not easily shared (F6). “ There are no clear triggers for new infrastructure, and limited processes to understand the cumulative impact of incremental development. Infrastructure gaps are only then identified when there are significant deficiencies in a network. ” Justin Madden Cities Consultant R9 calls for smarter ways to collect and share data to inform better use of existing infrastructure and the design of new infrastructure. IA recommends a ‘place led’ approach to infrastructure planning and design (R5). This approach calls for a revisit of sector-based planning that can lead to narrow perspectives on projects (F3). With a focus on place, infrastructure projects are assessed based on city-wide social and economic outcomes with support from various sectors in the city. It is a necessary shift to respond to Australia’s complex urban environments. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Overlapping, inconsistent and inappropriate funding mechanisms are also identified as clear inhibitors to coordinated infrastructure and service delivery (F5). Further assessment of the mix of available funding mechanisms to get the right infrastructure in place at the right time is called for (R7). The right infrastructure may be making better use of existing infrastructure assets as highlighted in R8. R6 elevates the community’s role in planning to strategic planning stages. This includes engaging people in conversations about the trade-offs that may need to occur within communities to support liveable cities for all. The full suite of findings and recommendations can be found here."
98,"Workplaces for our own, by our own",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/workplaces-for-our-own-by-our-own,,"Arup in Australasia is on the move both geographically and metaphorically, into our new Arup-inspired, performance-enhancing workplaces in three locations across two countries. Within a month, we’ve moved into Barrack Place in Sydney, to the Sky Park at One Melbourne Quarter and to Frasers Tower in Singapore. This is more than half of our workforce in Australasia – no small feat, and three great opportunities. As a designer, creating your own workplace is like a dream come true – with a few challenges! We have all had ideas, but we have been united behind a common purpose – to create environments that will enable us to perform at our very best while reflecting what our firm is about: design-led, socially responsible, inclusive to all and a great place to work. After 18 years in the same premises in Sydney, 15 in Melbourne and 11 in Singapore, it was time to rethink how we wished to work and how our workplaces could be better designed to enable that. We started this journey over five years ago. It was not only a business imperative – we were fast growing out of our existing spaces and the leases were all due to expire in late 2018 – it was also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We could be designer and engineer of both new buildings and workspaces in Sydney and Melbourne, but really ‘walk the talk’ on best-practice ‘total design’, sustainability and wellbeing. Working with HASSELL, long-time collaborators and workplace specialists, we created a set of Workplace Guidelines to guide the process of designing, delivering and measuring the success of all Arup workplace projects. It was a dynamic process of interviews, staff surveys, workplace workshops and global benchmarking. Together, we unpacked our culture, values, our preferences and differences. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. The final Guidelines have shaped the design of Perth – our first major office move, the refresh of Brisbane, Auckland and Townsville, as well as the new Sydney, Melbourne and Singapore offices. In the interim, we trialled ideas. In Sydney, we did some fit outs in our existing Kent St space to explore and test what worked best, feeding reflections back into the design process. The ‘Workshop’ with its bare concrete floors, freeform adaptable space and spirit of openness and transparency towards visitors of Arup, is one aspect that we have carried through to Barrack Place. My role has been to ensure that the core themes are incorporated, while encouraging each office to reflect its own character, building, people and the market it operates within. So, they all look and feel different but that’s the Arup way: we are not a rules-based sort of firm, we champion our independent spirit. In line with the feedback from our people – that they wanted to work much more with clients and work more collaboratively – our new spaces have been designed for side-by-side iterative work, be it through real-time modelling or other forms of co-design with clients. There are a variety of spaces, from experimental to specialist – Lighting Labs, SoundLabs, Maker spaces, and an Immersion Lab in Singapore. This Immersion Lab uniquely integrates a Lighting Lab and SoundLab with real-time auralisation, into a virtual reality environment. This bespoke multi-sensory space turns the review process of design into an ‘experience’. This is particularly helpful in the Republic where people are often speaking in a second language, bridging possible differences in communication. All these spaces have been designed to give clients a deeper experience of the design process, and enable our people to research and experiment with new technologies and approaches to design. We decided to go with ‘neighbourhoods’ so people can sit within a community of their sector or function group, wherever it best suits the task. There are diverse spaces to support a multitude of different working styles, group sizes and levels of focus. Workspace is clearly zoned into noisy, buzzy, hushed and silent areas, rich in furniture options from fixed standing, sit-to-stand desks to booths and mobile furniture. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. All workplaces have exceptional amenity, daylight, indoor air quality, greening of spaces, comfort, and physical and digital connectivity. There are end-of-trip-facilities for active transport commuters and specialised rooms for nursing mothers, prayer, rest and meditation. In Sydney and Melbourne, atriums or voids with internal staircases create ‘socially active’ central cores to encourage exercise and bump+spark interactions.

99,Human x Nature: The intersection of the natural and built environments,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/human-x-nature,,"In the run up to the Greenbuild International Conference and Expo in Chicago, three of Arup’s presenters tackle the conference’s 2018 theme: Human x Nature. Frances Yang, Senior Sustainable Materials Specialist; Arup Fellow Alisdair McGregor, and Tiffany Broyles-Yost, Associate and Sustainability Consultant spoke with Kelsey Eichhorn about biomimicry, the circular economy, and embodied carbon. Q: What is our responsibility as designers and engineers in protecting and preserving the natural environment? Alisdair: The shorter answer, particularly when we're designing more than a building on its own, like a community or a new development, is that the natural environment makes a difference to the building performance. Then you go beyond that to anything where you start to look at the built environment and human health, where actively incorporating natural systems within the built environment is extremely important. Frances: There’s definitely a push to incorporate natural systems in our design work. We're extracting so many resources from nature and then we use them to construct something that's displacing that natural environment, which means that people increasingly spend more and more time in a constructed environment. So our affinity for any sign of nature in that constructed environment is unsurprising. There's a responsibility there because of the impact we're having on the natural environment, but also a responsibility to the occupants — bringing them back to that human need of being connected to nature. Tiffany: Additionally, we're starting to see a professional obligation. The AIA amended its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to include new “Obligations to the Public” and “Obligations to the Environment,” which require architects to advise clients of obligations to the environment, promote sustainable design and development, and implement energy- and resource-conscious design. It’s not that we didn’t feel a moral responsibility before, but now we're seeing sustainability included in professional requirements because we know, as Frances said, how much time we spend in our buildings and the impact they have on us. Frances: Exactly. We're realizing there's a lot that natural ecosystems provide both for the health of nature but also the health of humans. More and more buildings are trying to mimic what happens in nature — like clean air and clean water and management of waste — so even though we are in the business of shaping the built environment, we’re using nature's model. Q: That seems to hold true in a lot of places, but is it particularly relevant when we think about resilience in the built environment? Alisdair: Yes, certainly. Most natural systems are pretty resilient — until we start messing with the climate — but generally natural systems can take a lot of sudden impacts and recover quickly. When we're looking at developing resilient systems, it's best to look first to nature, and, as Frances said, use that as a model. We've seen this particularly in flood prevention. Providing more absorptive materials, trees around riverbanks, and using natural systems to slow the speed at which floodwaters move all work really well. Really we’re restoring those natural systems that used to exist before the built environment altered the area. Tiffany: Also, we now need to mimic natural systems more because a lot of materials we use in building are no longer biodegradable. A couple hundred years ago a more linear system of material consumption wasn't so problematic because you took stuff out of the ground and then when you were done with it you could easily get rid of it because it would go back to the earth. That's not the case today. We've advanced in terms of material performance, but we’ve also regressed in terms of our overall systems. Now we have to figure out what do we do with all this stuff. That’s why creating a more circular economy is such an important topic. Arup’s circular economy house at the London Design Festival Q: Circular economy has certainly been a hot topic of late, but a lot of people outside our industry, and even some on the inside, don’t see a difference between it and past reuse models. Can you explain those differences, as well as some of the hurdles to circular economy adoption? Tiffany: There are two issues with reuse. One is making sure materials are safe and healthy — you don't want to reuse toxic materials. The other is scale; in past reuse models people took products or existing things and reused them in individual, unique ways, but there's a scale limit to that. Additionally, if you don't know what the raw materials are, which was often the case as recent as a generation ago because we didn’t track information on materials as well, it's more of a challenge to reuse. Those are two of the differences and challenges with circular economy, but they're not insurmountable. Frances: It's not so much the technical feasibility of recycling, the solutions for that are already available, but the economics still isn’t there. That's tied to logistics and infrastructure, but building experts are not best-placed to solve these challenges. Tiffany: Absolutely. You need the business model to exist and ideally government to set a framework. Then the designers and product manufacturers have to be onboard — you need everybody. That’s how we move from ideas into actually doing this. Then on the design side, it’s what I mentioned before — it’s designing for disassembly, mining buildings as material sources or banks, and scaling the practices. Alisdair: I agree; policy is essential if you want to enact a big change. Everyone complains at first, but you have to push policies that may not be popular and eventually people will adapt. Initially when some states brought in requirements for construction recycling contractors said, ""Well, that's impossible,"" but now most contractors on large projects have an 80-90% avoidance of landfill. Frances: That’s true, but it’s important to remember there’s never a single solution; it all circles back and now we're unfortunately hitting plateaus. The way a lot of the industry was achieving those rates was by shipping our garbage overseas. Now that those countries have healthier economies and are generating higher value materials in their own waste stream. The way things are now, it's all about getting buildings up as fast as possible, which leads to using more materials than necessary. I think we are going to see a shift where the industry realizes there's more imperatives than just schedule and hopefully that will lead to more changes. There's a lot of opportunity and, again, it’s not purely in our industry. We need to look to tech and logistics to infuse new ideas. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

Green wall in Arup's Singapore office Q: Speaking of the tech industry, do you see a direct connection between the digital revolution happening in the AEC industry and the continued development of sustainable building practices? Frances: It’s really incredible to be in this industry right now and I’m especially excited about Arup’s alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; I think one of the main benefits of the digital revolution is the way it can accelerate social change around the globe. It’s like digital provides the tools and innovations while the UN SDGs ensure those changes are channeled to the right initiatives, and sustainability in the AEC industry is a big part of that conversation. Like Tiffany pointed out, two major challenges are scale and material identification, and these are two areas where digital technology can really help. Tiffany: Absolutely. There’s so much more data now. You have information about the materials, you have information about how the resources are used once the building is operational, there's just so much more information available. Alisdair: Related to that are the analytical tools we now have and the optimization opportunities. We can test systems, we can show our clients and end users what impact design choices have, we can essentially simulate the future. We can also monitor that future in real time and improve adaptability. We're already using software like WeatherShift to simulate future climate so we can see how buildings might perform in 20 or 30 years and design them to be flexible enough to cope with different climate scenarios. Bioswales cross multiple New York City borough contribute to the re-greening is the city’s infrastructure. Q: Does digital hold the key to addressing the balance between re-greening the existing built environment versus focusing on new-build sustainable practices? Tiffany: We have to focus on existing buildings because more than half of the buildings that we have now will still be in use in 2050. We don't have enough time to just design net-zero new buildings, we need to be thinking about embodied carbon within our existing buildings. Part of that is trying to understand what exists and figuring out creative ways to use buildings or alter them to make them suitable for current needs. That might mean asking whether it’s better to rehabilitate a building or to tear it down and reuse the materials and components individually. We have the ability to do that because today there's so much more digital information available. Alisdair: I agree, there’s already a lot of material reuse happening, but digital enables us to take that a step further. Mass timber is great and most of the steel that goes into buildings these days is recycled. When we demolish concrete buildings we separate out the aggregate and reuse that, as well as the rebar. But there’s still challenges. Cement is a big problem, certainly from a CO2 standpoint, and there’s a lot of research, driven by digital data, into how to solve that challenge. Frances: Alisdair and Tiffany are right — the best way to move toward carbon reduction goals is to reutilize as much material as we can. If we look at new construction through 2050, our deadline for getting to zero, we've been doing so much better with operational energy that, if we remain on our current path, embodied carbon comprises nearly half of what will be built, compared to the operational emissions of new buildings. That means if we reuse, we could basically cut in half the emissions from new construction. We have the technology that can do that, but this is one of those times where the technology is not the challenge, it's more about approvals and risk. To a developer it's easier to build from new materials because he knows what's there. I think a place to start is to have more incentives to reuse what we have and, like Alisdair pointed out, sometimes you just have to introduce something and eventually people will adapt.

100,BIM reduces waste,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/bim-reduces-waste,,"Construction can be a wasteful process. Building information modeling (BIM) tackles this by creating a robust, accessible model and making it available to everyone who needs it. Recent figures from the US Department of Commerce show that there have been no productivity gains in the construction industry in the last 20 years, although productivity in other sectors has soared through automation and better information management. Construction does not lend itself to automation. Every major piece of the built environment is a prototype that must address its own unique set of user requirements, site constraints, aesthetic and social goals, economic realities and cultural context. There are few opportunities to build and test large elements of the project or to pressure the supply chain for parts that are frequently bespoke and require a great deal of skill to make. However, the construction industry certainly has scope to make better use of information. And this is where BIM comes in. A true building information management system holds the data in one place. My experience at Arup is that this allows our people to use their time for engineering and design issues rather than for chasing correct and complete information to support our work. Our work is intensely interdisciplinary and we pride ourselves on our ability to coordinate and cooperate with each other. For example, all our building disciplines use architectural information to understand the building form. Our structural and services engineers rely on programme information to calculate system sizes. Our electrical engineers base their designs on information from all the trades that need power to operate their equipment. And our acousticians and mechanical engineers need to collaborate closely to design quiet systems. The information can be voluminous, and easy access to a single ‘source of the truth’ can help to reduce the time we need to complete a design. A comprehensive BIM model can also help to reduce the quantity of materials we need. The visualisation of the final condition improves both our understanding and the contractors’ understanding of what is being built. As this visualisation happens before hammer meets nail, or saw meets timber, any re-work due to misunderstandings can be significantly reduced. Finally, BIM can help keep the whole design and construction team enthusiastic about their projects. Readily available information saves time, improves communication between disciplines and reduces re-work both at the design stage and on site. This leads to a greater focus on doing things right and better project outcomes. Find out more about our BIM expertise"
101,Stopping the spread: a new framework for fire safety,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/stopping-the-spread-a-new-framework-for-fire-safety,,"On the 11th March 2017, a fire swept through Imizamo Yethu informal settlement in South Africa. Over two thousand structures were destroyed, 9,700 people were displaced from their homes and four lives were lost. It was one of the worst fires in Cape Town’s history. Behind the headlines of conflicts, natural disasters, climate change and a rapidly urbanising world is the parallel story of the growth of informal settlements. They vary from slums to refugee camps and internally displaced persons camps. When these often-overlooked communities are hit by fire the results can be devastating and hard to recover from. To help address this global issue, we have launched a new framework that examines the fire risks in informal settlements and the potential interventions to mitigate them. Publications A Framework for Fire Safety in Informal Settlements The Framework for Fire Safety in Informal Settlements has been developed to facilitate collaboration and alignment of global efforts to create safer and more resilient informal settlement communities. Download Informal settlements are often unplanned and densely-populated. Residents may lack security of tenure, have poor-quality housing, limited supporting infrastructure and services. Physical factors such as a high density of buildings and the use of combustible construction materials (for example, plastic tarpaulins, bamboo, timber and even cardboard) can cause fires to spread rapidly. The simplest action of a child knocking over a candle or stove can have devastating consequences, consuming their own home in minutes and their entire community within hours. “ None of us can imagine losing everything we have in a single devastating fire, and yet this is the daily reality for so many, entrenching the cycles of poverty. At Lumkani, we have witnessed the continuous devastation caused by fires in South Africa, taking 250,000 people's homes in a single decade. Investing in reducing the risk of fires is our shared duty. ” Francois Petousis Head of Product at social enterprise Lumkani A new way of thinking But improvements in fire safety can and have been made in informal settlements. A new framework from Arup brings together our expertise in fire engineering and international development, to provide NGOs, aid organisations and governments with a new way to think about the fire risks in these settlements. By understanding fire risks at the household, community and city scales, we’ve defined potential interventions to help communities to mitigate this risk, as well as ways to prepare, respond and recover from a fire-related disaster. Watch: Rapid, consuming, deadly… In this video the scale of the problem of fires in informal settlements is made clear. To view this video, you must enable cookies. Fire is a disaster risk Recovery from a fire is a long and difficult process for anyone, and it is exacerbated in informal settlements where insecure tenure, financial instability, and a lack of insurance are common. The impacts from a fire often exceed the community’s ability to cope. On this basis, fire in informal settlements is a ‘disaster’ according to the definition of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. Despite this, informal settlement fires are often not included in disaster management policy and practice, and fire resilience isn’t enough of a priority. Every fire reflects local issues Every informal settlement is unique. A slum in India that has been around for decades faces different challenges than a camp housing refugees displaced from a Syrian warzone. Fire safety considerations for informal settlements must be holistic and take account of the wide range of competing risks and challenges. By first understanding the local context, investments in fire risk reduction can take advantage of existing resources and the capacities of the communities themselves. The framework places understanding local context at its centre, emphasising its relevance to every area of fire risk reduction. This keeps the framework relevant to different informal settlements around the world. “ Fire safety considerations for informal settlements must be holistic and take account of the wide range of competing risks and challenges, which are often unique to local context. ” Kenneth Wynne Associate Director Fire is a social issue Attention is most commonly focused on the physical aspects of fire, but fire is equally a social issue. People’s personal experiences with fire, their cultural beliefs and related perceptions of fire risk all influence their behaviour and likeliness to invest in fire safety measures. Investments in preparedness often address the social aspects of fire safety. Evacuation planning, community warning systems and fire safety education can significantly reduce fire risk and improve fire response, for example. A focus on these social aspects of fire safety may be the most cost-effective approach for communities that are well-established. This framework is the first step, allowing NGOs, aid organisations and governments to understand fire risk in all its complexity, and develop initiatives that will allow them to both prevent fires and reduce the consequences of fires that do happen. It is intended to support further research, encourage knowledge sharing and promote investments in fire risk reduction in global informal settlements. Listen to the podcast Fire Safety Engineer Danielle Antonellis and International Development Senior Consultant Darren Gill discuss the fire safety issues facing informal settlements and how they informed the new framework."
102,Behind the hype around connected and autonomous vehicles ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/behind-the-hype-around-connected-and-autonomous-vehicles,,"Behind the hype around connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) lays an inconvenient truth - that without appropriate market shaping they could lead to more congestion, less walking and public spaces become holding pens for ever circulating fleets. Governments must take the lead in setting the policy parameters in which this revision of the private car is allowed to operate, particularly in city centres, to protect both the environment and the public funds sunk into public transport. They must put the interests of the public, society and the economy ahead of the narrow sectional interests arising from the unprecedented levels of investment into CAVs, and at the very least maintain our existing amenity. And if governments are bold, they could create a far more equitable, safer and attractive urban environment. But why must governments take the lead? What problems should they focus on preventing? When markets operate unconstrained they typically either fail through unbridled competition (as we’ve seen recently in Sydney with hire bikes being abandoned on our streets and subsequent market withdrawal) or they push a huge cost onto the government and the economy to enable them to thrive (as we’ve seen with conventional cars over the past 50 years). But is the advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) actually anything beyond a technology shift? Are the consequences likely to be significant? That discussion should start with car share markets, previously known as hire cars. Uber and Lyft have caused major failures in public spaces, with London’s congestion cordon system challenged by the explosion of circulating hire cars, and New York City decrying the congestion impacts due to kerb space competition. The UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies found that more than half of all trips by rideshare would not have happened if rideshare was not available, and that the other half would predominantly have been made by walking or public transit. As Phil Carter of Arup postulates, Uber could kill the bus. And health gains made by increased active transport could evaporate. If free active transport, or low-cost transit, is being replaced by more expensive hire cars, and that still induces demand, imagine what might happen to demand on our road networks when prices plunge as labour costs are eliminated and vehicle operating costs plummet in an electric, shared and autonomous vehicle world. What could happen? It could evolve into an environment of unconstrained competition for customers, AVs circulating to increase the probability of picking up a ride, trying to find kerb space in demand centres. Looking back, this was why we created taxi ranks and constrained the ‘hail and ride’ points in city centres that disrupted traffic flow and increased unpredictable lane changing and accidents. It could evolve with the communications technology so that users and operators hammer government for more access in real time, with individuals empowered to demand instant access, further devaluing the community benefit of the shared ride. It could change how we use power grids, pulling on peak power load to recharge electric vehicles straight after the peak commute, coinciding with city centre peak surges as offices fire into life. If mobility as a service dominated by single user trips kills the bus and the train, imagine what your city centre would look like. In the Sydney centre those 500,000 people arriving in groups of 100 on buses and 1800 on trains every minute might arrive individually in a “pod”, also known as a car – albeit without driver. Would the demand for access push for ever more road infrastructure? And imagine what has to be done with transit to prevent that. What would the customer offer have to be if total freedom to choose, regardless of external costs imposed, was allowed to occur? Once the question of safety gets added, it gets more difficult. AVs cannot defy the laws of physics, so they can never provide the oft cited zero road toll outcome, unless we separate people and vehicles by barriers. Pedestrians who step in front of vehicles without warning are highly likely to be severely injured or killed. We take this as part of the cost of mobility today, but with changes to ownership models and with automated decision making, can we continue in the same manner? Will the promise of mass reduction in severe trauma lead to the acceptance of driverless vehicles? And then, acceptance of the reality that they can only work if separated totally from pedestrians? Can we risk not doing the work to fully understand the extraordinary benefits such a change in technology can bring, without fully exploring what the limitations in application should be for the broader benefit? We have the opportunity to completely rethink what is important in our cities and suburbs and to realise a far better balance for people of accessibility, mobility, safety and place. “ A critical role for government is, therefore, to guide the market on what will be acceptable, thus containing development costs, while ensuring the public gets the best value – a balance between the best public outcome and the cost to achieve it. ” Terry Lee-Williams Strategic Transport Advisor Already Arup is thinking critically about place and how to adapt to different demands that such technologies might bring. Our FlexKerbs initiative is being funded by the UK’s Infrastructure Commission for development and testing, to see if we can realise benefits of automated vehicles while maintaining public amenity and safety. If we think about regulation as the ability to appropriately allocate risk while incentivising good outcomes, rather than applying punitive measures for transgressions, it allows us to think very positively about a high-mobility future with far less downside. And if we think of all roads as the space between buildings held in public trust by the government for the public, and thus responsible for sharing it equitably, it gives us a solid starting point. As Adie Tomer wrote for Brookings, “It’s not hyperbole to say every single rule and penalty related to transportation and street design could be upended within the next few decades.” Governments should start collaborating now on the hardest ethical issues to resolve, as they will take the longest to agree on with the public. Then, they should move through to the more mechanistic issues arising from the developing technology including power supply, then management of the road space and rights to operate. Arup’s Global Knowledge and Foresight Leader, Chris Luebkeman, is fond of quoting the deputy lord mayor of Paris, who is emphatic that: “If you don’t design the rules of the game before 2020 it is too late.” And with the speed of development and investment occurring, there is some truth to that, though I suspect that we have enough time to have a proper conversation about what we value. Designing those rules does need to focus on what place we want to live in, how we value the people within that place over the technology that operates within it and how we might balance the pricing and funding challenges that undoing mass transit would bring to cities, but which might make suburbs much more accessible. It is time to move the debate from the technology, which is now a given over time, and into terms people can understand so that we can begin to shape a better world, not surrender to a more congested and constrained one.

Download this report Download A fire in an informal settlement can affect thousands of people. Fires take lives, cause serious injuries, destroy property and have a long-term impact on livelihoods. Recovery from fire is a long and difficult process, which can be exacerbated in informal settlements where a lack of insurance, financial instability, and insecure tenure are common. But this global fire problem remains largely neglected. The Framework for Fire Safety in Informal Settlements has been developed to facilitate collaboration and alignment of global efforts to create safer and more resilient informal settlement communities. Communities that are resilient to fire can withstand, respond to and recover from severe fire incidents, thereby contributing to residents’ broader wellbeing and long-term development. This requires action throughout the entirety of the disaster management cycle – mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. Improvements in fire safety may be realised through direct investments in fire risk reduction or as co-benefits from investments in informal settlements more broadly. The most effective investments will require holistic consideration of the physical and social nature of fire risk and fire safety. Download this report Download"

106,Stepping up together for climate action: The Global Climate Action Summit,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/global-climate-action-summit,,"Strategically hosted between the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the 2020 deadline to stop the global average temperature from rising by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) aims to ignite climate action ambitions. Summit attendees hail from a range of government sectors, businesses, nonprofits, and research institutions, all coming together to tackle the most pressing problem of our generation. Arup’s decades-long commitment to sustainability in the built environment is essential to the firm’s mission to shape a better world. Around the globe, our work seeks to check climate change and build resilience to avoid its worst impending impacts. In advance of the GCAS, Arup’s five delegates discussed climate-action mobilization, the importance of partnerships, and their desired summit outcomes. Our delegates: San Francisco Group Leader Aidan Hughes; Energy, Cities, and Climate Change Director Ben Smith; Americas Cities Leader Brian Swett; Americas Energy Business Leader Cole Roberts; and Arup Fellow Fiona Cousins. * Climate action has been a driving force in each of your careers. Why is this work important to you? Fiona: Climate action is the greatest challenge of our generation. It wasn't particularly a problem for the baby boomers because the population was much smaller, but the population has doubled in my lifetime. More recently, we’ve also seen a rise in affluence and the expectations about what and how people consume, as well as their quality life. That means we have to work really hard on climate action — it’s a huge intellectual, social, political, and motivational challenge. Ben: The stat I always use is that the urban population is nine times greater today than just 100 years ago. That’s worrying because it feels a little like we are disconnecting ourselves from the natural world, the very thing we need to work hard to protect. Fiona is right, climate action can’t be discussed by academics and politicians alone. Tackling this issue requires action on all levels — from individuals, communities, schools, etc. And it especially requires action from those who are seeking to integrate the natural world with the built environment. We have a huge responsibility as designers, not least of which is to do much more to bring these challenges into the mainstream. Brian: I agree — climate action is the existential threat facing humanity. It’s a game changer — if we don’t solve it, climate change fundamentally changes the ways in which people live, work, act, and play. While there are massive social equity challenges associated with it, climate action is a unifying problem that will affect everyone. I remember the Environmental Defense Fund ran a phenomenal ad, I think in the early 2000s, with some guy standing on a train track talking about climate change and why he didn't care about the issue since it wouldn’t impact him. As you hear the train coming, he steps aside and a child remains behind. The decisions we’re making today, they’re make-or-break for the next generation, and we’ll know in the first fifteen years if we’ve bent the curve on climate change or not. Cole: I think this existential crisis is also an existential opportunity. As Brian says, there’s a chance for this to be an exciting moment where we come together as a humanity. We can discover new, innovative approaches to energy, infrastructure, and transportation systems that wouldn’t have emerged had we not been forced to come together under a common purpose. The Construction Industry Council's Zero Carbon Building in Hong Kong There is sometimes an assumption that climate action and sustainability are the same conversation. How would you describe the relationship between the two? Brian: Climate action is necessary but not sufficient for sustainability. It’s like back in the green movement of the '80s and '90s when we used to get, “Oh yeah, I’m green, I recycle.” Very singular — if I check this box, then I’m sustainable. Fiona: Exactly, it used to be if you bought a hybrid car, you were there. Or if you always drank from a reusable thermos, you were there. There were lots of single-point activities and I think there's still a whole lot of that. In reality, you need widespread action — you need lots of partners with lots of primary impact points, because this problem is too big. We, together, have to do everything. Ben: And we are seeing this move toward partnerships. Cities are starting to recognize that mayors alone can’t deliver the level of action that’s needed. The United Nations and other similar organizations are starting to set up private sector alliances, and numerous private companies are showing leadership. Just look at the We Mean Business platform being promoted through the GCAS. Brian: I've been heartened, at least within the real estate developer and owner space, how much more seriously companies are taking this. They’ve gone from reporting on sustainability or energy or community engagement to truly changing behavior. They’re getting policies and practices in place that change the trajectory of what they're producing in terms of buildings in communities. Cole: I think that there’s actually more activity going on amongst our clients than is sometimes evident, especially when it comes to assessing climate risks. It's one thing for a company to come out and say what positive action they're taking to stave off climate change, which usually gains them some market benefit. It’s another thing for companies to assess their own risks. Personally, I’m heartened to know that there is more activity than meets the eye. Wind turbines adding renewable energy to the grid Decarbonization is a prominent approach to climate action in our industry. Where are you seeing the most progress? Fiona: In the United States, we’re seeing decarbonization leadership at the city level. Cities are beginning to set targets, like an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. In some ways, it’s a funny place to start, since cities don’t own the distribution or generation network. Ben: But I’ll add in that city leadership is often directly connected to (i.e., elected by) its citizens who have a strong voice in terms of regional and national politics. In our work with the C40 Cities initiatives, we’ve seen you often don’t need formal power to drive action. Fiona: Yes, absolutely. The other place that we're getting to see decarbonization quite a lot is in campus design. In those cases, there’s a little bit more control over the energy generation and distribution network. Brian: I’m happy to see that the metric in the built environment is transitioning from building energy efficiency to building emissions impact and emissions efficiency. We’re seeing a tremendous amount of research and interest around building electrification because there’s a realization that to decarbonize means we then need to produce zero carbon electricity. I’m also encouraged by the massive amounts of renewables that have been added to existing grids in northern Europe, west Texas, and elsewhere without breaking down the entire system. We can have a distributed renewable system that meets current demands for reliability and price. This isn’t to say that the transition won’t be challenging or costly, but the potential is there to achieve a zero-carbon energy system in our lifetime. Cole: One of the challenges of the net-zero dialogue is that it’s heavily focused on operations and procured energy from the grid. We just did an interesting analysis on the total carbon performance of one of our projects, and while the operations and transportation of the building are decarbonizing over time, the biggest issue is the building’s embodied carbon. There is a time-based value to when carbon is released, and the carbon released today is more important than what is going to be released in ten, twenty, fifty years. Think of the embodied carbon in all the infrastructure we’ll need to build over the coming decades to respond to climate change, the embodied carbon in seawalls, for instance. We have to address the embodied carbon factor or we’re going to bury ourselves in a situation where we’re emitting more and more carbon just to protect ourselves. Fiona: Yes, and as Cole says, if embodied carbon becomes the biggest component of our construction emissions, then the idea of the circular economy becomes really important. The circular economy is a way of trying to recycle, reuse, and repurpose materials through either the technical or biological cycle — so there’s an opportunity there. Aidan: I do think we’re seeing increased attention from our clients on the circular economy and its possibilities. And at Arup we’re doing quite a bit of research to demonstrate how a move to the circular economy can benefit our industry and offer up opportunities. We’ve teamed up with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation as a knowledge partner to try to embed some circular economy principles into our work in the built environment and to potentially provide leadership across this space. But there’s still a long way to go. The Circular Building, an installation for the 2016 London Design Festival designed and built using circular principles What outcomes do you hope to see from the Global Climate Action Summit? Fiona: Realistically, I hope for an understanding of the value of nongovernmental action and an energizing of those who are prepared to act. We need to come together to share ideas that actually work and inspire one another. Brian: I think a key outcome would be a continued formal engagement of subnational sectors. It wasn't until the most recent United Nations climate summits that subnational states even had a formal role. Historically the negotiations were very top-down, nation-state oriented. So much can be accomplished through coordination and commitments between nations, governments, businesses, cities, and states. It's creating the momentum that Fiona is talking about and recognizing the various structures and entities that are going to be key to moving us forward. Aidan: The summit is definitely an opportunity to show that the US continues to be a world leader committed to climate action and for us to demonstrate that leadership. But what’s most essential is finding the combined voice of businesses, cities, nonprofits, governments, and communities. Like my colleagues have said above, collective action is the only way we’ll make a difference. For Arup, this summit and guiding targets like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals give us a chance to think about our business in a different way. While climate change is something we can proudly say we’re already working to address, we constantly need to examine how we can contribute to climate action and step up."

108,Shaping the female city ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/shaping-the-female-city,,"Great progress has been made across the built environment industry to increase female participation in the workforce at all levels, and to create more inclusive environments based on fairness, respect and merit. Despite these efforts, the sector is typically well below national workforce averages. And despite inspirational female urbanists such as Jane Jacobs, gender mainstreaming – the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes – has been less observed in city making. We are used to discussions about whether companies have responded to a more diverse workforce and have provided a flexible, enabling environment for employees to balance work and other obligations. Yet we don’t often explore whether the way our cities are planned and developed is actually responding appropriately to similar challenges and needs. Being more conscious about who we are designing and planning for to create a more equitable or shared city – to accommodate everyone – needs greater exploration. We need to understand the changes in shaping our cities as a result of women in city leadership positions, and whether a city that provides for women and men equally looks any different to business as usual city development. The Habitat III New Urban Agenda strategically supports mainstreaming gender equality and women’s empowerment across all social development goals. And right now is a good time to be working in the built environment sector as the New Urban Agenda could, and should, be a real game-changer for women in cities. What can we do to make cities more female friendly? This needs to be addressed through process and design interventions. The process of city building needs to ask whether decision makers are applying a gender lens and placing greater emphasis on inclusive planning. Plymouth City Council in the UK has implemented gender auditing to measure ‘gender gaps’ in a planning policy or proposal. It’s not a new concept, but it is something that is often overlooked, despite being a vital part of equitable and sustainable planning. The first step to user-focused city planning is for planners, designers and engineers is to understand how everyone perceives the built environment - and there is no substitute for meaningful engagement with our community and recognising that the community does not have a singular view. Digital technology also plays a role in increasing participation of women in shaping cities through open and accessible platforms such as Free to Be’s crowd mapping tool that enables young women to identify and share public spaces that make them feel uneasy, scared or happy and safe. Concepts such as inclusive masterplanning, human centred design and co-design reflect the need for these places to be designed with the input of all users involved. It is all about building a deep empathy with the people you’re planning for and with, and recognising that what constitutes quality of life differs from place to place, community to community and over an individual’s life course. Public transport agencies typically do this well with a very customer centric approach to planning and design, but it’s not typically extended across cities with gendered urban design responding to female patterns of time organisation and simultaneously of tasks. Fundamentally, planning and design need to consider accessibility, to be welcoming and useful to the entire community. This is important if we want communities to own, look after and celebrate their shared spaces. More mixed land uses, better and more accessible public transport (accommodating varied patterns and multi-journey trips), safety and security and the co-location of social infrastructure – the city of short distances - are important considerations in making cities more female friendly and importantly more inclusive cities for all. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Are we on the right path? The qualities of a female city - a city that better addresses the needs of women - will start to address broader inequality issues, and with the New Urban Agenda, there’s a great opportunity to establish a paradigm shift much more broadly in liveability and equity related urban policy and implementation."
109,Encouraging city dwellers to walk more,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/encouraging-city-dwellers-to-walk-more,,"Many cities today are saddled with high car dependency, wider roads, fewer pedestrian-friendly streets, increased pollution and inevitably, low walking rates. Congestion is a common sight and this has affected liveability. Policymakers and planners around the world recognise the growing demand for more liveable cities. The focus however has been on developing public transport. That is only one aspect of making a city liveable – the other is to create an environment that is conducive for walking. As I look out my office window in Tanjong Pagar, Singapore, I see a lovely patchwork of small, walkable streets, food stalls and urban architecture. More importantly, I see people walking on the streets, enjoying the scenery and resting under the shade of one of the many trees in this garden city. It truly demonstrates what can be achieved when policymakers design cities with people at the heart. People lounging along the streets in Tanjong Pagar, Singapore. At the World Cities Summit Mayors Forum and Young Leaders Symposium in Suzhou last year, I shared three key principles on developing more liveable environments by creating more walking opportunities. Firstly, urban planning and design must begin with the people’s point of view. From this perspective, we need to think about the broad considerations to make the environment more conducive for walking such as safety, convenience and accessibility. For example, an obvious safety consideration is whether the paths are well-lit at night. And when we think about walking in a climate like Singapore’s, are these paths sheltered from the elements? Empress Place and Esplanade Park, Singapore Above all, the walking experience should be enjoyable and for this, it is important to design the journey to include pleasant spaces, beautiful streets and green corridors. In rejuvenating the historic Civic District, Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) successfully created new experiences for the people by designing environments and precincts that brought people closer to water. Second, shift mindsets to favour walking. In Singapore, nationwide campaigns like the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) National Steps Challenge are encouraging Singaporeans to walk more and lead active lifestyles. More than 350,000 adult Singaporeans participated in the second edition of the challenge which concluded in April this year, clocking a daily average of more than 10,000 steps. Design consultants can work with the Singapore government to create more opportunities to walk. Arup, for example, improved pedestrianisation in the Civic District by creating ‘shared zones’ where pedestrians, cyclists and motorised traffic share the same road space. Carriageways along Connaught Drive were reduced for vehicular traffic, freeing up space for pedestrians. Connaught Drive has made more space available for pedestrians. Singapore’s renowned shopping belt, Orchard Road offers another opportunity to increase walkability. With reduced roads and fitted with the right public infrastructure, Orchard Road could become ‘Orchard Street’. The reduced roads could cater to select vehicular traffic such as buses, taxis and bicycles only, resulting in more space for walking at leisure and facilitating community events to engage consumers. Lastly, be flexible in planning. To encourage Singaporeans to use public transport and get moving, the government has implemented several initiatives to ensure it is convenient to reach a train station or a bus interchange from home and work. These are known as first-and-last-mile connectivity (FLMC) initiatives and they include the use of bicycle, personal mobility devices (PMDs) and of course, walking. During this year’s Committee of Supply Debate, the city-state’s Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Dr Lam Pin Min shared that space allocation for pedestrians, cyclists and PMD users will be prioritised in town planning. This demonstrates the rigour that goes into planning an environment that encourages people to stretch their legs. But rigour needs to be complemented with flexibility to accommodate disruptions. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Orchard Road could become Orchard Street, with the right infrastructure and reduced roads. For example, plans to launch a government-led bike-sharing scheme last year were quickly re-assessed to instead support existing start-ups that were already on the ground rolling out bike-sharing services. The focus is now on resolving teething infrastructure issues such as the provision of bicycle stands to encourage uptake of cycling. This will in turn encourage more people to walk, according to city planning expert Jeff Speck who highlighted that the world’s most walkable cities are also among the most pro-cycling. These three principles are general enough to work for every city and they bring significant economic benefits. Our research shows that there is a clear correlation between cities with more actively mobile citizens and lower healthcare costs. These cities also have lower congestion costs. A separate study by Transport for London indicated that pedestrians contribute 65 per cent more to the retail economy. Hence it is in the government’s advantage to promote walking – and other forms of active mobility – in order to foster the local economy and create job opportunities. To achieve these benefits, collaboration between government agencies needs to be closer. Many developing cities still lack a framework to initiate discussion among multiple agencies. A good start would be to first dedicate resources for coordination. For example, Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) conceived an active mobility team whose inputs feed into the URA’s and Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) masterplans on planning and designing streets for pedestrians, cyclists and PMD users among others. The fact the government has recognised the importance of active mobility and is employing people specifically to drive that agenda is a huge leap in the right direction. Long-term planning is also key. We need to think beyond rather than playing catch up – plan for 2050 instead of 2020. With cities in the tropics, like Singapore, getting warmer, we need to build more walkable, more sustainable environments. This will inevitably create more liveable and attractive cities, changing the lives of citizens and those of future generations for the better, forever.

Our active travel team helps clients navigate the complex decisions these schemes seek to solve, to deliver lasting benefits to their communities.

110,Collaboration through technology: the key to a prosperous society,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/collaboration-through-technology-the-key-to-a-prosperous-society,,"Unlocking the promise of digital Digital infrastructure has long been considered an engine for economic growth and a beacon for private sector investment. The launch of the Mayor of London’s ‘Smart London Plan’ this month highlights the degree to which local authorities are now turning to data and technology to provide better public services and more broadly improve the lives of citizens. Unlocking the promise of digital in this way requires new, unfamiliar levels of collaboration at scale, between public and private bodies and underpinned by shared values. “ Where we can align opportunities for private sector investment with the potential to deliver improved public outcomes, we can make a real difference to society and the economy. One of the most powerful tools for doing this is digital masterplanning. ” Rick Robinson Former Property Leader Once considered peripheral, how we embed the right digital infrastructure to shape urban spaces is a growing priority for planners, local authorities and investors alike. And if we combine our shared values with a real commitment to practical execution, we can create communities that enjoy: Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. London is coordinating digital initiatives that will provide better services and attract investment through technology. 1. Greater economic participation Even in wealthy countries, many regions suffer from unreliable or slow internet service – with poorer areas often the last to receive network upgrades. Without common levels of connectivity, equal opportunities for all to participate in the digital economy cannot be realised. To solve this problem, smaller regions or districts are joining forces across boundaries, aggregating their demand so it’s more attractive for telecommunications suppliers to respond, and for digital skills development programmes to engage. This in turn increases the opportunities for local communities and businesses to participate in the digital economy. Initiatives like the Creative Digital City in Guadalajara, Mexico, have done this. Demonstrating how district-level regeneration can thoughtfully blend physical and digital elements for the benefit of the whole community. 2. Improved public services Consumer apps already offer commercial services, but public services have often been slower to adopt new technology. What often inhibits innovation is a lack of a digital plan that links available data sources and infrastructure to opportunities to generate valuable services that can be scaled. Some authorities are making headway in this area. On the edge of London, the One Epping Forest partnership has brought together members of adjacent boroughs to coordinate digital innovation initiatives that will provide better services and attract investment through technology. “ We are trailblazing the approach to building a regional consortium – not a city – that applies the right technology to help the local economy flourish. Arup’s experience working with central and international governments, and its understanding of what works and why is key to helping us achieve our goals. ” John Houston Manager, One Epping Forest 3. Fair and sustainable governance New technology also requires a new approach to governance, specifically the rules around data use and management, to allow authorities to fully apply the emerging power of digital tools reliant on big data and artificial intelligence. Defining effective governance must itself be a collaborative and inclusive process. In London, the Mayor has run a city-wide consultation with the public, regional leaders, businesses and tech firms, to understand what will make the capital a digital leader. Progress is reported openly, and policies can be debated by anyone. This approach shows that with the right rules and shared values in place, everybody involved gains the confidence to innovate. Finally, governance is also about practicalities. Investments in technology must be on the basis of interoperability and common data standards, to ensure solutions create agility and don’t result in “lock-in” to one way of doing things. 4. Enhanced social connectivity Digital technology’s ability to instantly connect people, issues, knowledge and places also makes it a powerful tool for solving social issues and strengthening community ties. Social start-ups like BorroClub in Birmingham, an app that allows people to share tools with each other, show how communities are benefitting from simple yet effective apps – saving money and meeting neighbours. By having a clear digital plan in place, local regions or authorities can encourage these ideas to operate and scale, contributing to local community objectives. Digital for all We know that digital masterplans created with sustainable, values-led objectives help to create more prosperous and equitable societies.

But how do they impact the health of their inhabitants? Fitwel, a certification system operated by the New York–based Center for Active Design (CfAD), allows users to find out — and then create healthier spaces. The system utilizes a scorecard weighing so-called strategies, such as whether public transit is accessible nearby, how many rooms are lit by natural daylight, and where the staircase is located (is it placed invitingly in the lobby, or hidden away in a stairwell, an obvious afterthought to a gleaming elevator?). Writer Rachel Dovey sat down with Joanna Frank, CfAD’s president and CEO; Liz York, chief sustainability officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which helped create the system; and Tiffany Broyles Yost, an Arup associate who’s also a Fitwel ambassador, to discuss the certification’s history, how it’s unique from LEED, and how to apply a holistic notion of health to zoning regulations and building codes. What’s the backstory of Fitwel’s creation? How did the CDC become interested in a health-based certification process? York: The idea of translation has been key to this entire effort: looking at how to take the stacks of public health studies showing us what changes behavior and turn them into something that architects can understand and use. Around 2010, a group formed — made up of the General Services Administration (New York Federal Buildings), the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the CDC — and we began the process of determining what the strategies were going to be. We tried to build on the success of LEED, looking at what it does well and what users wanted us to improve. It was great to have someone else go before us so we could see how the market was responding. Frank: CfAD was awarded the exclusive license to operate Fitwel in May of 2016 after a competitive selection process. We’ve since expanded it beyond workplaces to multifamily residential buildings in conjunction with Fannie Mae, which has created a new loan called Healthy Housing Rewards. Fitwel rates buildings on a scale of one to three stars. Have any of you scored your own buildings? Broyles Yost: We have two-star certification for our New York office, and the Boston office has a three-star rating. The Boston office scored higher because we were renovating it around the time we did the scoring, and there were a few things that were easier to do from scratch. Our New York rating looked simply at the existing space. If we’d done things like purchase adjustable work stations, we could have scored more points, but we really wanted to see how the rating applied to an existing space without any changes. York: Our chronic disease center only scored two stars at first, so we looked at some of the low-cost things we could do to push it over the edge — even just putting up signage here and there. We made a few changes and when we went back to the scorecard, we had three stars. Three ways to make your building healthier: Encourage use of the stairs: Two minutes of stair climbing per day is enough to prevent average, middle-age weight gain. Improved work spaces: In addition to active work spaces, employees benefit from natural daylight and other biophilic design choices. Indoor air-quality policy: Indoor air pollutants are on average two to five times greater than outdoor pollution levels. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Liz, you said earlier that Fitwel was built on the success of LEED. Can you elaborate on that? York: LEED gets people excited about doing these really hard things by giving them a prize level — silver, gold, or platinum. It’s a competition. So we also wanted to give people benchmarks that they could aim for. But LEED is complicated. It brought a whole bunch of building science knowledge to the table and taught a lot of engineers, architects, designers, and owners about sustainable construction. We didn’t want to teach everyone about public health science — we just wanted to give them the strategies and then have them implement the strategies however they wanted. Another goal was to have Fitwel be a kind of everyman’s certification system, in that any building could get better. So we took out the prerequisites because we didn’t want anyone to say, “Oh, I can’t meet prerequisite number one, and so therefore I’m not even going to try.” Broyles Yost: One example of a prerequisite within LEED is that no project would be able to meet certification if it were built on previously undeveloped land. That’s an incredibly reasonable and well-thought-out policy. In Fitwel, though, the goal is to improve. There’s nothing that says you must obtain this certain level within your building. It doesn’t say that there can be no smoking anywhere within the campus or near the building — it says there’s a health benefit to not smoking and you can get a lot of points by making your building smoke-free. There’s more carrots and fewer sticks within this system. In its focus on the environment, LEED already covers public health in a sense. Why is it important to have another certification program for the more personal side of public health? Broyles Yost: There’s a health epidemic in our country related to lack of activity and exercise that can’t just be medicated away. And we’re in buildings 90% of the time. That epidemic is something we should all be working on. And designing for individual health is incredibly relatable. It’s difficult in some ways to talk about climate change, which is a very large, global program that is difficult to understand and happens in the future. But if you tell me that the way I’m living and the things I’m doing daily give me the health of a 55-year-old woman when I’m not a 55-year-old woman, that resonates directly with me immediately. York: Health has always been one of the things that architects have been charged with. We are supposed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. Most of our building codes and zoning regulations are based on that idea. But I think that architects in recent years have lost the health charge in our focus on safety. Fitwel is a call to put health and well-being front and center again. Earlier Liz mentioned testing the market response to Fitwel. Can anyone elaborate on how they’ve seen LEED change the marketplace and how they anticipate Fitwel doing the same? Broyles Yost: I think one really basic and concrete way within LEED is the recycling of construction waste. When I started working on LEED projects in New York in 2001 or so, it was very difficult to get contractors to sort and recycle construction waste. Within 10 years, we didn’t have to think about that because there was a market for crushed concrete and recycled rebar, and a cost-benefit to contractors to sort through those things. With Fitwel, I think the active design strategies are really relevant. We see more active and interstitial stairs than we used to. And a lot of Class A office spaces are starting to implement active work stations as a standard within their spaces. Five years ago, a standing desk was kind of odd. Frank: To add to what Tiffany said, we’re seeing demand for health-promoting environments coming from both the workplace and residential sectors, because the occupants of both are prioritizing health when deciding where to work or live. That’s borne out by recent data relating to businesses’ rates of retention and housing developers’ pricing. There are many studies connecting increased value in real estate with health-promoting environments, proximity to transit, and well-maintained parks. Ultimately, we want to bring about a market transformation in all aspects of the building industry around health, and that feels like a realistic goal.

114,Yes in my backyard: An integrated approach to homelessness,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/seattle-block-homes-yes-in-my-backyard,,"Meeting the challenges of increasing homelessness Homelessness is at crisis levels across the United States. More than half a million people are without homes across the country. Stratifying wage gaps and skyrocketing costs of living mean that homelessness is on the rise in San Francisco, New York, Boston, Seattle, and many other US cities. Some in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, including at Arup, are considering the role they may play in exacerbating the crisis — and the role they could play in helping solve it. Several employees at Arup’s Seattle office are now assisting with the BLOCK Project, an innovative nonprofit with a mission to place 125ft2 homes for the homeless in backyards of single-family homes. The homes are completely self-sufficient and sustainable. So far, two homes in Seattle have been completed, but more people have volunteered their backyards for the project and dozens more homes are in the pipeline. The idea is to eventually get a BLOCK home on every residential block in Seattle, and expand to other cities. Writer Peter Moskowitz caught up with Arup senior administrator Mia Areaya and mechanical engineers Anne Shellum and Zoe Roberts to talk about their involvement with the project. What exactly is the BLOCK Project? Shellum: The BLOCK Project is an offshoot of a nonprofit called Facing Homelessness, which was started in Seattle by a local architect who recognized the need to reach across barriers that we form in our society and invite the homeless community into our lives. The way we're currently sheltering our homeless population is very segregated. There's been an effort in Seattle to create homeless communities and shelters, like tent cities, but they're always formed behind fences and barriers, isolated from the rest of the neighborhoods in the city. The BLOCK Project was designed to place tiny homes in the backyards of single-family homes, so that it would be less of a segregated community and more of a neighborhood effort to get somebody back on their feet and reintegrate them into society. “ We’re helping shape the city physically, but we also need to help shape the city socially. We need to be working with city planners, builders, everyone. ” Mia Areaya Senior Administrator What drove you all to help with this project? Areaya: There's not a day that goes by that we don't see or hear about the homeless crisis in Seattle. My daily commute takes me through a few shelter spots that always have a line that doubles around the building, so it's pretty impossible to ignore. As an office, we’ve held other charitable activities to support local shelters and food banks, but I felt that Arup as organization could do more. So when Anne brought the project to my attention, I was really excited — it’s in line with Arup’s charitable mission and something we can all get involved with. Shellum: Seattle has a lot of single-family housing right in the city center, which means a lot of open backyard space. And at the same time, we have one of the highest homeless populations per capita, with essentially no place to go. The City is throwing millions of dollars at this, trying to come up with a solution, yet the problem is getting worse every year. This model was the first that I'd heard of that genuinely seemed scalable, plus looked at a different side of the problem: how to reintegrate people that feel so disassociated with the city community. This model seems both disruptive and achievable. Arup is well-known for finding unique solutions to improve the built environment, so this seemed to really align with something that our company would be good at and would be able to champion. Roberts: Our Seattle office joined other firms in the AEC industry to raise money on behalf of the project. Building these homes relies entirely on donated materials, design skills, and labor. Arup has a goal of raising $35,000 for the BLOCK Project — the cost of building one home. Once that goal is met, we will be matched with a resident and start to build our Arup-sponsored BLOCK home, which is the part we are all the most excited about — making this project a reality. BLOCK homes are completely off-the-grid, powered by solar, with rainwater-harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Why is BLOCK different than more traditional projects that address homelessness? Shellum: The current model allows any Seattle resident to assume that the homeless problem isn't theirs to acknowledge or tackle. The BLOCK Project kind of flips that on its head. We want to put new BLOCK residents in every neighborhood so it becomes everybody's responsibility in the community to work through a solution to this problem — not wait for somebody else to solve it. Roberts: Plus the BLOCK houses are designed with sustainability at the core — not just in the physical design of the homes, but in the model itself. If a house has a yard, that's kind of dead space to everyone else in the city — it belongs to one family. With the BLOCK Project, however, you're freeing up that space as a community resource. You're opening up a perfectly viable space in the center of the city to people who really need it, reducing the need to build alternative housing at the edges of the city and figuring out a way to build housing that doesn’t contribute to sprawl of the city. Housing solutions that are sustainable for the environment and sustainable for the city will ultimately be the most successful. Shellum: These houses are meant to be examples of the best way of living, the best-in-class design. They're pursuing Living Building certification — the highest standard in sustainable design — which aligns with Arup’s vision for the built environment. Volunteer homeowners/hosts Dan Tenenbaum and Kim Sherman, and BLOCK home resident Robert Desjarlais (center) Do you think it’s the design and building industry’s responsibility to grapple with issues like homelessness? Roberts: Yes. We work on these multimillion-dollar projects that don't necessarily serve everyone in the city. We also have the skills and the manpower to be working on things like the BLOCK Project. It brings awareness to our industry and offers an outlet for giving back. It's specifically tailored to what we're good at. Shellum: Many corporations purchase carbon emissions offsets. We can think of this in a similar way. Like Zoe was saying, if we contribute to a built environment that benefits one portion of our city’s population, we must also dedicate ourselves to designing for the other portions. That is truly sustainable design and what it means to shape a better world. Areaya: We’re helping shape the city physically, but we also need to help shape the city socially. We need to be working with city planners, builders, everyone. We can be advocates within the building industry for these types of initiatives to become part of the fabric of our work. Join the Arup team to help build a foundation to end homelessness in Seattle, one backyard at a time. Question or comments for Mia Areaya or Zoe Roberts?

Download this publication Download Arid environments are characterised by a natural scarcity of fresh water and precipitation. They currently account for 30% of the world’s land surface. Yet far too often, cities in arid environments are planned and designed based on a global city making paradigm that fails to respond to region specific opportunities and challenges. Cities in regions including the Middle East, Australia and the south west of the United States require climate appropriate design solutions to create sustainable and liveable cities. Cities Alive: Rethinking cities in arid environments proposes a strategic rethink of how we plan and design cities in arid regions. At the heart of the report sit three key recommendations to shape the next century of city building in arid regions: Learning from the past. Build upon locally adapted climate-specific design solutions. Invest in green and blue infrastructure that is designed to work with local environmental and ecological systems. Designing intelligent buildings and public spaces that can meet the needs of people in changing climates. The report proposes 36 actions that local governments, planners, architects and investors can consider to support the development of more inclusive, resilient and competitive cities. #aridcities Download this publication Download"
116,Tomorrow's terminal: designing for the digital passenger,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/tomorrows-terminal-design-for-the-digital-passenger,,"On 27 December 1995, the very first flight was sold online. Just over two decades later, every flyer is a digital passenger, providing and consuming vast amounts of data, from our trip itineraries and social media posts to shopping preferences. And while airports already use digital technology to power various aspects of their operation, most have yet to create a complete digital passenger experience – and reap the benefits. The potential gains are immediately apparent. Terminals that adapt to avoid queues and overcrowding. Faster and more secure check-in procedures. Retailers with stock tailored to the preferences of passengers that use those routes. Our own use of digital strategy in terminal design has already demonstrated what’s possible. Perhaps more importantly, digital services are the only way to meet the expectations of a new generation of passengers. ‘Generation Z’ is used to a world of services that unconsciously meet their needs and reflect their preferences – so why would travel be any exception? In the video below we explore the benefits of following a data and technology driven approach at every stage of a passenger's journey. To view this video, you must enable cookies. The data-powered terminal But it’s not enough to simply collate information in siloes. It must flow through the terminal to provide real commercial intelligence. For this reason, we see more collaborative relationships between airport operators, airlines, retailers, and service providers as vital to facilitate this new, data-powered operation. With the right strategy in place, every aspect of the airport can be improved: Design for future flexibility: Terminals are huge investments, but the industry is a dynamic one so operators need facilities that can adapt to fluctuations in passenger numbers. Digital tools can help produce modular designs that respond flexibly to passenger flows without additional costs or bottlenecks. Smoother (faster) security: A smooth passenger journey can be derailed by the slow speed of check-in or security checks. Frequent fliers who opt-in to share biometric information in the USA are already being fast-tracked – an idea that could have much wider application. Higher retail revenue: Space in airports is constrained, so how do retailers achieve higher revenues? With Bluetooth beacons installed throughout a terminal retailers and food/beverage vendors can send personalised offers to passengers whose preferences they already understand. Better baggage control: Arrivals data can be used to improve carousel efficiency, reduce waiting times and avoid unnecessary belt maintenance. Passengers could track ‘digitally tagged’ bags from their devices, providing peace of mind by showing exactly where they are located and when to collect them. “ Airlines and operators appreciate that terminals should be designed from the ground-up to produce the digital experiences passengers demand ” Ian Taylor Director Scaling digital experiences As every airport or airline operator knows, a seamless travelling experience has many moving parts. That’s why piecemeal digital improvements at one stage can easily be undermined by a poor (analogue) experience in another. A truly end-to-end digital passenger strategy is the only way that digital improvements can be scaled to benefit the operations of all parties, at each stage of the passenger journey. Beyond BIM Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools already offer immense insights to improve terminal design, but we can now push the data they contain to answer harder operational questions. For clients, the key is to work with a partner who can use data to inform every aspect of the terminal, from BIM-based design, to developing profitable passenger experiences during peak dwell times. By designing for the digital passenger, airports will be able to offer a truly smooth, responsive experience - one that would’ve seemed unimaginable when that first e-ticket was sold. You can find out more about how we implemented this approach in our work in our related projects."
117,Torrid urbanism: city-making in the tropics,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/torrid-urbanism,,"So hot in summer your head throbs waiting to cross the road. Rain so heavy you’re up to your ankles on the street in minutes. Colours so intense they make your heart sing. Divine ‘winters’. Cylones! Also known as the ‘Torrid Zone’, the tropics are intense. Intense storms, colours, heat, and humidity. So much so that Aristotle in the 4th century BC boldly proclaimed the Torrid Zone as too hot for human habitation. Today, in fact, approximately 40% of the world’s population lives in the tropics, and by 2050 this will climb to over 50%. At the same time, the Tropics are the most bio-diverse region on Earth, hosting about 80% of the planet’s terrestrial species and over 95% of its corals and mangroves. The majority of the world’s fastest growing cities are located in the tropics. Very high population growth, intense and sometimes wild weather, super dense cities, vulnerable environments and populations – torrid indeed. It’s true we are all drained by the heat and humidity when it is extreme But there are also great swathes of time when the temperatures in the Torrid Zone are benign. The combination of benign temperatures for substantial portions of the day and (and in the subtropics over the year), the capacity for abundant vegetation and the ample supply of water makes the tropics and subtropics perfectly suited to the creation of a sustainable high density urbanism that integrates low energy design and urban greening. Cities in the tropics and subtropics still have excellent examples of how cities and buildings were designed prior to the wide usage of air conditioning. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Brisbane and Cairns all have their own localised versions of urbanism that use shade, breezes and urban cooling in their own unique ways. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Courtesy WOHA Architects Cool narrow lanes which are shaded and intensify breezes. Deep shaded loggias with screened gardens allowing breezes to flow through the environment. Leafy streets where the tarmac is shaded all day and doesn’t heat up. Elevated garden terraces for catching evening breezes (and maybe a long cool drink!). Buildings that use thermal mass to trap cool air as a resource. Or lightweight construction that instantly changes temperature as the day cools. It is not too much of a leap then to imagine an urbanism that scales up these local climatic adaptations to spaces that accommodate higher densities to service our ever-growing population in tropical and subtropical cities. Our urban high-rises would be more porous with garden rooms inviting cool air to pass through the walls, creating respite from the heat. Our streets and public spaces could be more like shaded and sheltered urban living rooms offering relief in the heat and inviting occupation even when it’s very hot, or very wet. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Courtesy WOHA Architects Sound utopian? It’s actually happening. Singapore, for example, has enshrined this kind of urbanism in its plans for the city for over a decade, and leading architects and engineers are well versed in the practicalities of implementation. The city has demonstrated that the much wider integration of green infrastructure and adaptive climatic design, even in high density environments, benefit urban ecologies and the health of populations whilst mitigating the impacts of climate change. “ Amongst all the complexity of city-making there is much to be gained by paying particular attention to natural climatic advantages and harnessing these to make the cities of the future. ” Caroline Stalker Principal This is particularly true of city-making in the ‘Torrid Zone’ – one of the fastest growing urban areas with the most opportunity to harness nature to create liveable, vibrant and bio-diverse cities.

Not only is our population skyrocketing, people are living longer than ever before and a far greater percentage of over 65’s are living in our cities. What are the opportunities and challenges of urban-based aging population? In an era of rocketing housing prices, infrastructure challenges and increasing social isolation, how do we ensure our cities cater for multi-generational physical and social inclusion? Meet Ian Ian is 80 years old. He goes camping once a month. He sometimes makes the 12 hour drive to see his children and grandchildren but wishes they were closer. Ian is thinking about downsizing his house soon but likes his independence and connection to the community. Ian doesn’t think he’s ready for a retirement village just yet. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. To take a deeper dive on these questions we held a workshop at MPavillion in November 2017, as part of SIBLING Architecture’s ‘Designing the Age Friendly City’ day. The workshop consisted of a design exercise put together by Arup’s architectural research programs. Attendees were divided into two groups—half represented over 65s; half, the younger generations. They were asked to work together, not on a city plan, but on the smaller scale of a prototype for a multi-generational communal home. Beyond four-walls, toward a tech-equipped home The benefits of technology were recognised by both groups as a valuable weapon in the fight against the degenerative effects of aging. A number of technological innovations were proposed for our prototype multi-generational home including voice activated doorways and tablet equipped virtual libraries. Away from physical enhancements, groups noted that social issues such as isolation could be combatted with technology. Meet Anne Anne, 67, uses technology to improve her access to the wider community. She starts her morning by contacting as many people on Facebook as possible. She’ll then read the paper and send e-mails via her phone before organising something social to get her out of the house. She runs an AirBnB. The other week, Anne hosted an English backpacker. Anne’s use of technology enriches her social life, allows her to keep up with her friends, and provides a source of income through her AirBnB. “ As humans we crave comfort, companionship, and autonomy. Often, these needs become harder to meet as we get older. In combatting these things with technology, we need to consider how we create pathways for aging communities to learn how to use the digital. ” Kristian Winther Associate, Architecture Publications Shaping Ageing Cities Read our Shaping Ageing Cities Report Shaping aging cities This is not the first time we’ve investigated technology as an enabler in the pursuit of more age friendly cities. In 2015, Arup released a publication titled Shaping Aging Cities, which looked at how 10 major European cities are responding to the social, environmental, and mobility needs of an aging population. Among the many trends teased out in this publication was the emergence age-friendly digital environments. Of course, not even the most staggeringly ambitious of us ever believed such a complex design challenge could be solved in an afternoon. But the workshop allowed us to see what happens when we begin to reimagine the boundaries of the conventional home and think about the kinds of transitions that could be made to make the wider city more age-friendly."
119,Designing cities for independent and healthy children,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/designing-cities-for-independent-and-healthy-children,,"The recent focus on child friendly cities among built environment professionals has received much attention among academics, designers, institutes and the media. The beauty of this theme is that it speaks to a vast number of people. Some of us have children, some of us are grandparents, aunts or uncles. We have all been children. The concept of child friendly cities touches all of us and the desire for our children to have safe and happy childhoods is one most of us share. With around 70% of the world’s population predicted to live in urban areas by 2050 (Children in the Urban World, Unicef, 2012), we are at a critical planning stage and change to policy can be implemented. Take Australia for example; our cities are surrounded by sprawling suburbs that have spread out like tentacles over the decades. More recently we are seeing densification, helping to connect the suburbs to the urban centres, and massive development to allow more people to live closer to employment and transport hubs. During this time of city shaping development, childhood experiences will be very different to our own. Now is the time to consider how we want our children to learn and grow in our cities and factor this into our urban design planning and policy. Our recent report Designing for Urban Childhoods, highlights many benefits of child-friendly cities demonstrated through case studies which cover health and wellbeing, local economies, safety, creating stronger communities, nature and sustainability, promoting resilience and catalytic change for improving cities. The child-friendly city offers the opportunity to be a city considerate of the needs of all citizens: a city truly for all. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Tackling obesity with independent mobility Critical for child friendly-cities, and an opportunity to tackle the rise in obesity, is the need for independent mobility and children’s infrastructure. Independent mobility allows children to feel safe walking to school, and encourages more active travel, supports the freedom to get around independently of adults. There is also natural and important correlation between independent mobility and health. A recent Sydney Morning Herald article stated that more than 10% of children in western Sydney are considered obese, which raises concerns that we are not adequately considering how to best support children’s mobility and need for infrastructure. According to Active Healthy Kids Australia, walking 2km to and from school, 5 days a week for 40 weeks a year (so a full school year) will equate to about 400km of distance covered by foot. Walking 400km burns approximately 38,400kJ which can be represented by 64 cans of cake or about 1kg of fat. Healthy body, healthy mind Variety and opportunity for activity is needed. A range of accessible parks and open spaces, places to be active or linger in a comfortable and safe environment, being social and exploring helps foster a healthier lifestyle. In addition, a study in Sweden found that children who have connection with nature and green spaces have reduced levels of stress and aggression levels, increased ability to concentrate, improved academic performance as well as the reduced risk of obesity. Publications Cities Alive: Designing for Urban Childhoods Through 40 global case studies, 14 recommended interventions and 15 actions for city leaders and built environment professionals, the report shows how we can create healthier and more inclusive and resilient cities. Download Safe routes and street smarts With the rise of car ownership and impact of adverse weather, it can be challenging to encourage our young people to walk to school and enjoy their neighbourhood parks. Street-smart awareness is critical. Creating safe routes to school within our local communities can support an increase in daily activity and the implementation of healthier, greener streets. Safe and accessible routes will help to increase independent mobility, and brings the opportunity to rethink infrastructure such as accessible public transport – trains and light rail – within close distances to homes, to foster child-friendly environments. Planned for, designed and accessed every day Planned for, designed and accessed every day For those of us living in apartments, and with more and more families moving into high-rise living, the solution isn’t as simple as opening the back door for play time outside. Active transport and green spaces must become part of the norm – planned for, designed and accessed every day. For example, in London’s Kings Cross, where development continues to densify the city, arts programming, urban gardens and a natural open air swimming pool generated activity in the Kings Cross Central’s outdoor spaces from the early stages of development. Barcelona is supporting physical activity with a radical superblocks strategy, restricting traffic to main roads and turning internal streets into safe and green ‘citizen spaces’. Strategic interventions and policy changes can support the broader awareness of designing with children in mind. Focussing on a local scale will make a deeper impact on the daily lives of our cities’ children. Importantly, we need to create cities and places that allow our children to experience healthy and active lives without the need for constant adult supervision. Our smallest inhabitants need attractive and vibrant places, flexible spaces, healthier streets, activity, places to explore and opportunity to be a recognised and equal part of city life. If we can design a city that works for children, we will have designed a city that can be enjoyed across the generations."
120,Property hits the digital tipping point,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/property-hits-the-digital-tipping-point,,"New business models, maturing technologies and an unprecedented level of user insight are redefining how property will operate and generate value. In the last twelve months ‘Proptech’ has assumed its place alongside Fintech as one of the most exciting areas for venture capitalists – in 2017 alone, investment in the sector jumped 28% to around $3.4bn, according to CB Insights. Investors are being attracted by the new possibilities that digital tools and insights are bringing to the once slow–moving property business. This year, I believe we will see a rapid rise in the number and value of these developments and projects across the property industry, driven by three market factors in particular: 1. Meet Generation Z...and their high expectations Generation Z are entering the workforce with new ideas about workplaces. Born between the mid-1990s to early-2000s, these sophisticated users of digital services expect the same responsive, personalised experiences in their homes and offices. Property developers, owners and operators hoping to acquire occupants or talent are having to rethink how they embed digital technology to meet Generation Z’s ever-expanding expectations and grow market share. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. 2. Rise of the digital business model Today’s property business models must possess a smart technology dimension or risk being irrelevant. Flexible workspace giant WeWork is a great example. They’re using a digital property strategy to produce more inviting, responsive spaces and securing better returns on investment. Their success underlines wider investor confidence in Proptech and crucially, places greater pressure on developers and operators to provide efficient, profitable spaces. 3. From Internet of Things to intelligent assets Thanks to IoT devices, user behaviour is finally out of its black box. Networked sensors offer real-time insights into how people and organisations are using their homes and workplaces, allowing owners and operators to determine whether an asset is operating effectively across its lifecycle. For investors and developers, they can help to shape an asset’s entire proposition around the user experience for the first time. The technology is affordable, but property players need to ‘design-in’ digital services from the outset to unlock this information. We used our SoundLab simulation technology to help design the working experience at White Collar Factory, which shows how digital tools can precisely define the new user experiences owners require. “ The property industry has an exciting opportunity to improve our cities, producing sustainable and enjoyable spaces. ” Rick Robinson Former Property Leader Improving our cities If you were designing a property business tomorrow, a digital-first mindset would likely shape your entire business model and supply chain. You’d want to know how your assets are running, who’s using them, and why they’re used in the way they are. Beyond the obvious commercial advantages, this new approach heralds a shift in property where buildings adapt and improve to reflect changing needs. In a larger sense, digital property will improve our cities, producing adaptable buildings that meet higher standards of environmental performance, energy usage and create enjoyable places to live and work.

121,Building castles in the air: what can Sydney’s history teach us about an autonomous vehicles future?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/building-castles-in-the-air,,"As evidence from Boston is showing us that ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are increasing traffic in that city by replacing transit and walk trips, even in the transit-rich city centre, it is timely to reflect on how transport planning needs to facilitate better urban outcomes from technological advancements. The future is always hurrying towards us. Andrew Gordon’s Book, The Rules of the Game, explores a familiar story: the technological disruption confronting the world’s navies in the late 19th/early 20th centuries as they adapted to the advent of coal-fired propulsion and wireless communications, rendering their existing methods of communication and coordination obsolete. The author describes the British navy’s First Sea Lord’s modus operandi as ""the building of castles in the air” and the role of his staff as “the rearing up of earthly foundations to meet them"", meaning that instead of undertaking analysis of how to use the new technologies available, they were ex post-facto constructing the justifications for the adoption of innovations. The Battle of Jutland in 1916 put this approach to test, and the navy’s failure to adapt their fleet management methods to future technology saw the British fleet suffer devastating losses. Fast forward to today and coal-fired propulsion is out and autonomous vehicles are on the horizon. Well, in many ways they are already here, but fully-autonomous vehicles could be right around the corner. They have the potential to completely reshape our cities and their transport systems; in fact that potential seems to be autonomous vehicles’ main selling point. Political figures are already calling for planners to rethink investment in public transport infrastructure in Australia and New Zealand on the assumption that autonomous vehicles will solve many of our cities’ transport problems. “ The phrase ‘transport planning’ implies we are at the front edge of things, helping to guide and direct our future transport networks and services. But too often, we have been led by the technological imperative of new developments. ” Brian Smith Instead of giving directions from the front, we have hurried along behind these developments, backfilling justifications and facilitating the adoption of the new (rearing up those earthly foundations), unable to catch up and with insufficient time to think about the wider consequences of new transport technologies and proposals. At present, I see this rush to facilitate and embrace autonomous vehicles as having the same characteristics. There’s a real risk we will reverse what gains we have made in making our cities more liveable, by not creating the planning policies, strategies, frameworks and mechanisms to ensure we can reap the social and transport benefits autonomous vehicles offer, while minimising the negative outcomes. Closer to home, the demise of Sydney’s tram network provides a cautionary tale. From 1861’s first horse-drawn trams, the network grew to be the world’s biggest. However, after the second world war, the rapid rise of the private car and the bus sounded the death knell of the tram. In 1946/7 around 13% of trips were made by car. By 1960, a year before the Sydney tram network was finally dismantled, 50% of trips were by car and by 1971, car had captured 70% of trips. Transport planners helped to remove the trams. The flexibility of private cars and buses was seen as their great advantage over inflexible trams. Cars permitted people to live where they wanted and let industry shift away from the inner city, resulting in the sprawl and congestion many of us spend our careers trying to overcome. Transport planning was dragged along behind the new technology of the mass-produced private car and the bus, urgently changing our city to facilitate the car. So what are some of the risks of autonomous vehicles to our cities and why should we be concerned about them? The most urgent, in my view, is the way autonomous vehicles are assumed to interact with pedestrians and cyclists (the original autonomous vehicles). Many of the benefits to the performance of the road network that autonomous vehicles can offer, as demonstrated by traffic models – increased capacity by means of closer headways, doing away with traffic lights by having autonomous vehicles navigate intersections like networked schools of fish – assume that pedestrians and cyclists are not present. As soon as they are introduced to the model, things turn to custard. The technology that helps the vehicles avoid crashes will grind things to a halt once unpredictable pedestrians and cyclists are detected. There’s two ways for the transport planning industry to resolve this. One is to say that in busy pedestrian and cyclist areas such as cities, autonomous vehicles are excluded (after all, if we can trust the collision avoidance technology, what will stop us from stepping off the kerb at any place, confident the autonomous vehicles will stop for us?). The other way is to separate the pedestrians and cyclists from the vehicles. We already have the model for this in underpasses, overhead bridges and footpath fencing. Which future do we want for our cities? If we look to the car manufacturers, we can get some hints about which way things are heading. Manufacturers are taking two approaches. The first is a steady introduction of autonomous vehicle technology to new car models – automatic parking, lane-keeping technology, crash risk detection etc. All things to ease the burden on the driver and improve the safety of owners. The second approach is to promote the urban planning benefits of autonomous vehicle technology, for instance by showing how autonomous parking technology can reduce the size of car parks (the car can drop you off then park itself in a stacked space, or a narrower parking space because the doors don’t need to be opened), making more land available for parks and buildings. Both models aim to protect the private ownership model for cars in cities. In this version of the autonomous vehicles future, driverless cars are circulating the streets, picking up and dropping off their owners and disappearing out of sight. A KPMG study estimated that in the USA, autonomous vehicles could unlock 1 trillion more miles of driving by 2050, partly by providing mobility to the old and young who may not be travelling now. In accordance with the principles of induced demand, the space autonomous vehicles make available will immediately be filled by more travel demand. Commuters in Sydney Central Business District In Sydney, almost 80% of CBD workers use public transport to get to work. If only a few percent of these workers shift to an autonomous car, how could we accommodate them on our streets? I suspect most transport planners would prefer to see fewer cars in our cities, rather than more. We want to see our cities made even more pedestrian and cycle friendly. There are good social and economic reasons to do this. So how do we harness the potential of autonomous vehicles to achieve this outcome? As transport planners, we have a clear choice right in front of us. Do we follow behind as the technology determines the outcome, or do we grab opportunity by the forelock and shape the autonomous vehicle future through policies, strategies and planning frameworks to deliver better cities and a more sustainable and safe transport network?

In our report Designing for urban childhoods, we explain how we can create healthier and more inclusive, resilient and competitive cities for all of us to live, work and grow up in. To showcase our thinking we compiled 40 global case studies, 14 recommended interventions and 15 actions for city leaders, developers and investors and built environment professionals. The amount of time children spend playing outdoors, their ability to get around independently, and their level of contact with nature are strong indicators of how a city is performing, not just for children but for all generations of city dwellers. If cities fail to address the needs of children, they risk economic and cultural impacts as families move away. Read more in the Cities Alive series Cities Alive: Designing for Urban Childhoods Through case studies, recommended interventions and actions for city leaders, developers and investors and built environment professionals, this report shows how we can create healthier and more inclusive, resilient and competitive cities. Download The ‘everyday freedoms’ of time spent playing outdoors, children’s ability to get around independently, and their level of contact with nature are strong indicators of how a city is performing, not just for children but for all generations of city dwellers. If cities fail to address the needs of children, they risk economic and cultural impacts as families move away. In the info-graphic below, we explore 14 ways to design child-friendly cities. How children can influence all aspects of our cities Less pollution, more green spaces, and the freedom to move about easily and safely – these are aspirations shared by city leaders and children alike. Although city leaders’ influence is understood, the role played by children in urban improvements has largely gone unnoticed – until now. We’ve found a child-friendly approach to urban planning is essential for the creation of inclusive cities that work better for everyone. “ It’s about looking at what affects young people most and using this as a framework to inform all aspects of planning, designing or managing cities because it benefits all of us ” Sam Williams Landscape Architect Beyond playgrounds, towards children's infrastructure An integrated child-friendly approach reverses the idea that children’s space should be discreet areas, such as playgrounds, and excluded from other parts of the public realm. It’s not an either/or situation whereby an environment is child-friendly at the expense of any other group – instead, creating a ‘children’s infrastructure’ network of spaces, streets, nature and design interventions provides an opportunity to create better cities and better outcomes for all generations. Watch: This video looks at how child-friendly urban planning can help unite progressive agendas such as road safety, air pollution and sustainable behaviours, benefits which go beyond children and add value to all citizens' lives. To view this video, you must enable cookies. Children unify stakeholders The consideration of children’s needs is highly effective in unifying politicians, planners and developers, as well as communities and businesses, on many aspects of the urban environment. When children are the over-riding motivation for improvement, consensus about the specific measures needed is more readily reached. For example, prioritising the benefit to children’s lives was key to successfully delivering pedestrianisation in Tirana, Albania. In Ghent, Belgium, the city’s child-youth vision is the only recent city planning policy document to win cross-party political support. “ A child-friendly agenda is no longer simply a CSR requirement. Developers are beginning to see the benefits themselves ” Felicitas Zu Dohna Foresight & Research Analyst Developers are listening to children’s needs The case for shaping planning and urban design around the needs of children is clear. If developments are attractive to children and families, they appeal to all ages, automatically marketing themselves, as vibrant, safe, clean places. Developers also realise the economic benefit. When areas provide for everyone, space can be saved. Management costs also tend to fall because the more a public space is used and shared by a community, the more behaviours in public spaces automatically improve. Consequently, a child-friendly agenda is no longer simply a CSR requirement. Developers are beginning to see the benefits themselves. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

In Utrecht, in the Netherlands our expertise was sought on how to develop a new residential neighbourhood that appeals to families. We worked with the developer to priortise interventions that meet children’s needs. For example, we designed solutions that supported safe and active movement, creating a comfortable outdoor environment with spaces where the whole community could enjoy activities together in locations that caught the sun. Other examples of developments where child-benefit has been put at the heart of plans and rationales include the mixed-use projects by Wesgroup at River District in Vancouver, Canada and Argent’s King’s Cross Central in London. They have both become highly desirable neighbourhoods to live, work and grow up in. “ Child friendliness should be considered in policies for transport, health, environment, arts and culture. ” Hannah Wright Urban Planner King’s Cross Central supported diverse activities for more cohesive communities. ©John Sturrock Children are influencing city planning Prioritising children’s perspectives is about looking at what affects young people most and using this as a framework to inform all aspects of planning, designing or managing cities because it benefits all of us. For example, children are more at risk from cars as they find it hard to judge their speed and are less visible to drivers, while young lungs are more susceptible to life-long damage from pollution. With this knowledge, planners and policymakers can reconsider their traffic measures, prioritising the next generation’s needs, which in turn benefits everyone. Such an approach is visible in the draft London Plan which enshrines in its principles children’s ability to get around and to play actively in the city, in contrast to playing in specified areas. It’s a powerful shift – signifying that child-friendliness should be considered in policies for transport, health, environment, arts and culture. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

Child-friendly principles can be applied everywhere Even small actions that take a child’s perspectives can amount to big changes for the community. For example, if all street furniture has to score highly on playability as well as functionality during procurement, a bench can become a destination; a child could crawl under it, climb over it, or swing on it, while accompanying parents are prompted to spend more time outside. Meanwhile, a requirement for a pavement to be 50cm wider could makes a street safer and more pleasant to walk along. As our report shows, we believe child-friendly principles should be integrated from the outset for all aspects of urban projects. Only by taking such an approach will our cities be fit for our children to grow up in and for everyone to live and work in. You may be interested in...

124,"As tall timber takes shape, acousticians set standards for sound",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/as-tall-timber-takes-shape-acousticians-set-standards-for-sound,,"The following article was written by Rachel Dovey, a Northern California-based journalist, with input from Denis Blount and Peter Dodds, members of Arup’s acoustics, audiovisual, and theatre consulting group. There are many well-chronicled upsides to building with cross-laminated timber (CLT), an innovative and fire-resistant take on the classic framing material. It’s far greener than cement or steel — trees, after all, are “made” by sunlight and water rather than through a carbon-heavy manufacturing process, and they sequester carbon as they grow. It holds great potential for rural economic development and stateside job creation. And if done right, it’s cheaper than conventional building. One downside: the acoustics. A CLT frame is significantly lighter than one made of steel or concrete, providing less airborne and impact sound isolation. That’s particularly challenging for developers trying to construct any kind of multifamily housing, because building codes specify how much acoustic separation is needed between units. When Arup began working on the Framework tall timber tower, one of the winners of the US Department of Agriculture’s 2014 Tall Wood Building Prize Competition planned for downtown Portland, Arup acousticians Denis Blount and Peter Dodds set out to make sure the building’s residents wouldn’t be kept up all night by their upstairs neighbors. Together with the architects at LEVER, they began drafting mitigation strategies and testing them using the Arup SoundLab. At the time, the stakes were high and the data scarce. USDA officials selected Framework to serve as both pilot and proof that CLT can work for tall buildings — when completed, the 12-story building is expected to be the first timber high-rise in the US. Wood, of course, is often used to frame single-family homes and smaller office buildings, but since the end of the 19th century, when cities began to densify, steel and concrete have been developers’ exoskeleton of choice for buildings over five stories. Their preference was partially due to simple engineering — the so-called balloon frame design commonly used for wooden buildings at the time could only sustain a few stories — but it was also a response to the massive fires that devastated cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and San Francisco between 1871 and 1906. CLT, however, is sometimes referred to as “plywood on steroids” and is not your great-grandfather’s timber. It’s made by gluing multiple layers of dimensioned lumber together to form slabs, then layering those slabs in opposite directions like three-dimensional latticework, and it can compete with steel in both strength and fire resistance. Still, because it’s not commonly used for tall buildings in the US, Dodds, Blount, and the LEVER team didn’t have much information to work with — and they knew their results would set a precedent in the domestic market. “ When we started there was not a large set of acoustic data on how these mass timber assemblies perform ” Denis Blount Associate Principal ""We began by collecting information on what’s been done by some of our overseas colleagues.” Blount explains. (Mass timber is an umbrella term that encompasses CLT as well as nail-laminated timber and dowel-laminated timber). Mass timber is more commonly used in central and western Europe, particularly Austria and Germany. A large mass timber structure is also currently going up in Amsterdam. But according to Blount, builders in those markets often cover the wood up to improve acoustics and/or fire resistance. Framework’s designers wanted the building’s aesthetically pleasing bones exposed, which proved challenging since thickness and density tend to equal better sound isolation. Complicating matters, the international data didn’t always translate. “The hard thing with that data is that it didn’t necessarily account for the use of a domestic product,” says Jonathan Heppner, an associate with LEVER Architecture. “So while there might be data for acoustical testing that performed well in another international location, we have a domestically produced piece of CLT panel. The standards work differently because of the requirements for code.” And the codes they were following relied on target numbers. For example, the International Building Code requires an STC (or sound transmission class) and IIC (or impact insulation class) rating of at least 50 each — but the team suspected that due to the new material’s unique characteristics, those numbers might not accurately reflect residents’ perception of noise. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Cross-laminated timber “Because mass timber is quite a bit lighter than traditional building materials, what’s getting captured in that single number is not necessarily always indicative of how we’ll experience sound interacting with that building element,” Dodds says. To that end, Arup’s SoundLab was indispensable. The calibrated 3-D listening space that Blount calls “the aural equivalent of a visual rendering” was developed for concert hall design, and it allows users to make decisions based on the evidence of their own ears, rather than abstract renderings and charts. From the outset, Dodds and Blount knew that they would be relying on some kind of mass-and-resilience combination to form a sound-mitigating barrier — something massive for blocking airborne sounds and something pliable to absorb footfall. A CLT handbook has several example assemblies, many of which meet the code minimums. But many of those pretested assemblies were actually too thick, Dodds explains. They would be costlier to produce, and the building’s inhabitants would lose valuable floor-to-ceiling space. So the two consultants began testing combinations of rubber and concrete in various sizes and densities, adding and subtracting things like a resilient underlayment to a finished floor or a pad that would act as a kind of noise-isolating cushion. They tweaked the design in the SoundLab, using recorded noises that could potentially be bothersome to Framework residents — for example, a television playing in a room or the sound of footsteps from the floor above. Because they’d gathered test data for the various assemblies, they could run the television noise through the SoundLab’s custom software and watch — or, more accurately, listen — as it took on the acoustic properties it would have in each design scenario. Eventually they landed on what Blount describes as a “CLT-plus-acoustic-topping sandwich.” To showcase the beauty of the wood, they opted for a design that layered the wooden framing with a thin layer of rubber and then a thick (but not too thick) lightweight concrete slab called Gyp-Crete, followed by the finished flooring.

Testing the cross-laminated timber Their testing data filled a definite void in the US market. And because it was USDA-funded, it will be made public so that designers and acoustic consultants working on the country’s next mass timber high-rise won’t face quite as many challenges as the Framework team. CLT probably won’t go mainstream overnight. Despite advances in fire safety, strength, and now acoustics testing, a number of challenges remain. For one thing, it’s still something of a novelty, and from an architectural perspective, Heppner says, developers in hot urban markets tend to migrate toward lower-hanging fruit. “If an American company isn’t really super familiar with CLT and they’re not familiar with what a project needs and looks like, they’ll probably move on to other, more easily gained markets,” he says. “ Whenever new building methods or materials are introduced, there’s a learning curve associated with how making these new advancements in technology can best serve the market and create efficiency, ” Dodd explains, ""Right now, we’re in a phase where the industry is figuring out how best to deliver timber products.” Still, Framework, which is set to break ground next year, will accomplish the USDA’s goal of showing that a mass timber high-rise can be built. And Arup has helped create a blueprint proving that those tricky sound challenges — at least one potential downside of CLT — can be solved. “In my mind, the big thing is that we’re showing the rest of the US, ‘Hey, we can build with mass timber, and we can build tall with mass timber,’” Blount says. “It’s feasible from a fire and life-safety standpoint. It’s feasible from a code standpoint. It’s feasible from an economic standpoint. And it’s feasible from an acoustics standpoint. That’s a big win.”"

126,The Fourth industrial revolution: meet the technologies reshaping the built environment ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-meet-the-technologies-reshaping-the-built-environment,,"We are now in what Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum has termed the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ – a revolutionary merging of the physical and digital realms. In this emerging era, Schwab foresees that combinations of information-powered and networked technologies will transform the way entire industries work. But what does this mean for the design and operation of the built environment? “ Overall, the inexorable shift from simple digitisation (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution) is forcing companies to re-examine the way they do business. ” Professor Klaus Schwab World Economic Forum From combination to innovation A new Arup research publication, the ‘Emerging Technology Timeline’ examines how a cluster of emerging technologies will allow designers, architects and engineers to fully optimise the design of the built environment, taking into account the complex interplay between a building or an infrastructure asset and the wider natural, physical and digital systems in which it sits. Among the new technologies that will together deliver this vision are “Smart Dust” sensing equipment and future communications infrastructure supplied by Bluetooth 5.0 and 5G internet. Also on the horizon are the abilities of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to give us the opportunity to learn from the data captured, analyse it and make more informed decisions about the built environment. “ Combinations of these technologies are producing a highly disruptive new world of information, one which will in turn drive innovative systems-based approaches to design and engineering. ” Marcus Morrell Associate Quantum computing and leaps Much of a designer and engineer’s work involves understanding the complex interplay of many different parameters. For example, designers need to explore the implications of an alteration in a structure’s design on energy use, lighting, foundations, rentable area and so on. With existing technology and techniques it is reckoned that there is a hard limit of about ten to twelve variables that can be meaningfully understood and managed at once. Quantum computing promises the power to tackle far more complex calculations, and at incredible speeds. These machines move beyond the ones and zeroes of traditional transistors, vastly increasing the ability to undertake large computations. Looking ahead, the computing power of an entire data centre could be contained within a single small box, enabling levels of data analysis that far exceed today’s capability. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. One useful application for advanced computational power might be to probe and better understand the more subtle implications of design choices on social and environmental domains. For example, what likely societal or ecological impacts would a hospital or school situated in one potential location have compared to another? Complex concepts such as city resilience would also benefit from advanced analytics and computational power. A new level of control Immense quantities of highly detailed data, thousands of connected sensors, a quantum leap in computing power, visualisation tools that put the designer in virtual worlds. All these technologies together promise to give designers and engineers true ‘systems-level’ perspective for the first time. This vastly richer level of insight means better, more sophisticated decision making for clients and a more efficient and sustainable use of the world’s precious materials. They also point to a future for design and engineering where collaborative, data-rich processes inform every choice, bringing client, engineer, user and community closer together than ever before. Buildings that learn… and teach We could greatly refine design thinking if we understood how buildings perform once they’re in use. Traditionally the building management systems that facilities managers rely on have been discrete technologies, often disconnected from each other and unobserved by the engineers who initially designed them. However, new ‘smart dust’ nanotechnology sensors promise the inexpensive monitoring of every aspect of a building post-occupancy. This level of embedded awareness means buildings become intelligence-driven, almost self-aware, allowing owner, designer and operator to subtly refine how an asset is used throughout its lifespan."
127,A new era for sustainability: could digital technology align humanity and nature?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-new-era-for-sustainability-could-digital-technology-align-humanity-and-nature,,"Why do we care about sustainability? It began as a humane response to the growing sense that unfettered production and consumerism were damaging our natural environment. At first our interest in protecting nature was mostly in order to ensure a future for ourselves, but over the past 30 years our definition of sustainability has matured and expanded. Today the concept embraces not only the impacts we have on the natural environment, climate change and scarcity of natural resources, but also biodiversity as well as human and social needs. In short humanity has started to recognise the value and importance of the wider ecosystem of which we are just one part. As we’ve moved into the ‘fourth industrial revolution’, powerful connected digital tools and processes are allowing us to have greater mastery and understanding of sustainability implications of given design choices. We have started to possess a level of technological mastery over the natural world unprecedented in human history. Technology for technology’s sake But some voices are concerned about this push towards technology-driven decision making. Paraphrasing the Italian philosopher Umberto Galimberti, we’re being seduced into replacing our own human concerns with technology’s inherent logic, reason and priorities. His fear is that we run the risk of mistaking our capacity to do things for our ability to foresee their effects. In short, technology allows us to think we are in control, while actually enabling us to lose control. One danger is that we mistake technological advances for a good in their own right, with human concerns and nature suffering in largely unpredictable ways as a result. So, how do we keep humanity, technology and nature aligned? “ Humanitarianism also implies a social conscience, a wish to do socially useful work, and to join hands with others fighting for the same values. ” Sir Ove Arup Founder Finding the balance At Arup, we’ve always believed that collaboration across disciplines produces the most socially valuable end results, producing the built assets our clients need while minimising their impacts on the natural environment. This humanitarian mindset was championed by our founder Ove Arup over 45 years ago and we remain committed to it today. With Professor Galimberti’s warning in our ears, it’s clear we need a vision of sustainable design supported, but not supplanted, by technology. One way to achieve this is to prioritise communication with the many stakeholders affected by built environment projects. After all communities, clients, and the public at large will all have to live with the effects of the ever-grander choices technology allows us to make. Sustainable projects should produce an emotional response as well as rational appreciation. So by aiming to increase the beauty of the built and natural environments at once we would naturally build public support for this new vision of sustainable design. Towards a new alliance We will need a more integrated and conscious design process, one where digital technology helps us to evaluate the human and natural consequences of design choices, to the mutual benefit of these two very interdependent parts. This would involve a commitment to prioritising ‘soft metrics’ such as comfort, health and wellbeing indicators alongside existing and new environmental requirements. It might also mean changing our relationship to precious resources, becoming more ‘circular’ in our thinking, developing new organic materials to construct with instead.

A few projects already point to how this future could be realised. Projects like Green River in Milan show how relics of the industrial age can be sustainably reimagined for a new era. Arnhem Station shows how digital tools and a human need for beauty can produce an extraordinary combination. With increasing urban development and the challenges of climate change this new sustainability ethos is an idea for its time.

128,Are cable robots the future of construction?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/building-the-future-are-cable-robots-the-future-of-construction,,"The use of robots continues to spread across industry. Sophisticated, fixed-arm robots have been assembling cars on production lines for decades. Today robots are gaining bigger and bigger roles in healthcare, mining and other manufacturing sectors. Construction however has been slow to adopt robot workers. A few, static, fixed-arm robots have slowly been introduced into the construction process on small scale projects and pavilion type buildings. But these are limited to what they can construct by the length of their arms and their fixed position. The sheer variety and nature of construction sites requires a more flexible, dynamic and responsive solution. One emerging possibility is cable robots. Cable robots are highly flexible, easy to install and able to move precisely in three dimensions. They typically comprise a central lifting device suspended from a number of cables and winches. A cable robot can be programmed to select, lift and move construction elements into a predetermined position based on x, y, z coordinates, having scanned their environment to calibrate their exact position in space. By using winches to change the length of the supporting cables the lifting arm would be able to move in all directions. “ Viewing construction as the assembly of ‘off-site’ fabricated building components is slowly becoming the norm, but we haven’t yet brought the advantages of digital tools and automation to the site itself. ” Francis Archer Project Director, Arup The robot advantage Cable robots’ advantage over the fixed-arm ones you find on production lines, comes from the wide range of locations they can operate in. On a construction site, they could be attached to adjacent buildings rather than having to install huge tower crane-like structures. Previously difficult construction sites would become accessible using simple support structures that place the winches at any height and in any position. Once installed the cable robot assembler won’t suffer from fatigue or tiredness so could theoretically run day and night, far more safely than a human operated tower crane. The small amount of noise generated from the winch motors and the movement of the end effector is significantly less than a traditional building site allowing it to be run at night. The winning entry for 2017 annual competition [email protected] is a perfect illustration of how the construction industry will evolve and embrace the potential that machine learning has to offer. Watch the video below to see how collaboration amongst emerging designers, across all sectors and disciplines can lead to an exploration of new technologies and techniques. Arup is working with Arthur Mamou Mani architects to consider how cable robots might reshape and streamline the construction process. To view this video, you must enable cookies. What could a robot build? So how could cable robots take part in construction? Robotic automation works best when carrying out repeat, similar tasks. This means buildings will need to be designed as a set of components that can more easily be assembled and connected. These components will need to be designed with simple, rigid connections that snap together or interlock to allow them to be assembled in a pre-determined sequence with minimal human interaction. Some building typologies are more suitable to cable robot construction than others. Buildings that involve many repeat components or have vertically repeatable floor plates would all benefit, possibly skyscrapers or modular housing. Architects and engineers would still be able to program the variances or differences between the design solutions so that a measure of design individuality is retained. 1 of 2 Cable robot being utilised as a small scale domestic 3D printer. Credit: Mamou-Mani Architects. There would be implications for delivery and storage too, with components brought to site and stacked in ordered, individual piles. The robot will need to know where to pick up the correct component from the right pile and in the right order. The stacking order of the components in the piles becomes just as important as construction sequence itself. Changing an industry Bringing cable robots into construction could result in dramatic improvements to an industry used to incremental change. Safer, automated construction sites will speed up the time taken to erect buildings, and lower the impact on the neighbouring community. Building costs could come down too, given the reduced time on site and labour cost savings. But we should be clear: this will require a fundamental shift in how we, as architects, designers and engineers design and ultimately construct buildings."
129,"At this Montreal school, big sounds come in small packages",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/at-this-montreal-school-big-sounds-come-in-small-packages,,"The following article was written by Zach Mortice, an architectural journalist based in Chicago. The design for La Musique Aux Enfants began with one key question: “How can we make a basement sound more like a concert hall?” said Willem Boning, an acoustic consultant with Arup. The brainchild of Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal director Kent Nagano, the Musique Aux Enfants program is a collaborative initiative by the orchestra, the Université de Montréal, and the Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l’Île to teach roughly 180 pre-K and kindergarten students choral, piano, and violin music. Located in the previously unfinished basement of a public school, the classical music curriculum will serve children in Montreal North, a neighborhood with a high percentage of low-income households. Architects at LEMAYMICHAUD and acousticians at Arup donated their services to the project. According to Arup’s Tateo Nakajima, who worked on the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal’s concert hall, the Maison Symphonique, the project grew out of Nagano’s long-standing desire to overcome disparities in access to music across the city and offer children a welcoming and inspiring space to explore the benefits of music. “The orchestra has done things like free, open-air concerts which bring together tens of thousands of people every summer. But they wanted to bring music to very young children in some of the most diverse communities in Montreal. So they brought friends together to work to make this a reality.” The design team helped the school make the most of its low-ceilinged basement by carefully calibrating the room’s acoustics and incorporating exuberant visuals tailored to the lunchbox set. An informal group lesson area houses child-scaled tables and chairs. Visit today and you’ll find a 4,000-square-foot space divided into three areas. First, there’s an informal group lesson area with child-scaled tables and chairs, along with an anime-style mural that dispels any ideas of white-wigged classical music snobbery. But it’s the other two areas — a set of practice rooms and a performance space — that define the school’s sonic experience. “ The orchestra has done things like free, open-air concerts which bring together tens of thousands of people every summer. But they wanted to bring music to very young children in some of the most diverse communities in Montreal. So they brought friends together to work to make this a reality. ” Tateo Nakajima FRSA FIOA Arup Fellow Hallway solutions The eight individual practice rooms that run along a hallway posed some of the project’s biggest acoustic challenges. One of these was sound isolation. To ensure that air would circulate properly in the practice spaces, each room needed to be connected to the HVAC system through a duct in the ceiling. But these same ducts would also carry noise from room to room. The solution involved creating a maze of ductwork that would prevent sound from circulating. “The architects tested it by standing in neighboring practice rooms and yelling into the diffusers,” Boning said. “Our idea worked — they couldn’t hear each other.” The second major practice room design challenge involved sound quality. Without any acoustic treatment the rooms would have sounded overly loud and experienced a phenomenon called flutter echoes: noise that bounces back and forth off parallel walls, creating a metallic, ringing sound. One obvious solution was to cover the practice room walls and ceilings in acoustic insulation. But this would “make the room sound dead,” Boning said, like the students’ notes were “going into the void.” The solution lay in angling the walls instead of creating a rectangular box. This scattered the sound waves, preventing flutter echo formation. The team then optimized the amount of acoustic treatment to control for volume without dampening the rooms’ sound too much. An added benefit of these odd angles, said LEMAYMICHAUD’s Jean-Marc de Grandpré, is that the school has no long, monotonous corridors. The hallway’s playful atmosphere is reinforced by kid-sized teal benches. Musique Aux Enfants by numbers The program kicked off in 2016 161 total students will receive at least one lesson per week 16 students will have more than an hour of instruction each day Another group of 16 will have three hours of instruction each day A small grand hall To make the school’s performance area sound much bigger than it is, Arup’s team developed a two-part strategy. First, they used sound-reflecting surfaces around the stage to create a buildup of reverberant energy, similar to the effect found in larger concert halls. This provides acoustical feedback to the children on stage and makes them feel like they’re in a bigger, grander space. Second, the acousticians positioned sound-absorbing treatment in the middle of the ceiling while keeping the upper corners hard and sound-reflecting. The sound-absorbing portion helps to control loudness in the audience area and lessen claustrophobia-inducing reflections from the low ceiling above. The hard corners, meanwhile, add a sense of spaciousness to the room’s acoustics. The finished space is wide open, with nary a column or even any fixed furniture. Seating comes in the form of cube-shaped ottomans in bold orange, blue, purple, and red. This arrangement also helps with programmatic flexibility — a particularly important quality for a venue that will in the future be used by community groups when school is not in session. The small-scale performance stage directly references the Maison Symphonique. The stage itself is made from sound-reflective cherry and maple wood, its design directly referencing the Maison Symphonique. “We used the pale wood used in the Symphony Hall so the kids would have a sense of performing in a hall, even if they’re very young,” said de Grandpré. These design strategies were successful in bringing classical music to a child’s level without trivializing it. The school “does not impose any kind of elite, intimidating atmosphere, but it brings the best qualities of concert halls to a scale for children,” said Boning. “It shows that this isn’t just something that the pros can have or that only people who can afford an orchestra ticket are entitled to.” Get in touch Find out more about acoustics, arts and culture in the built environment Tateo Nakajima FRSA FIOA Arup Fellow [email protected] +44 (0) 20 7636 1531 London, local time - 10:30pm"
130,Up and running: The speedy recovery of Houston’s City Hall,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-speedy-recovery-of-houston-city-hall,,"On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey slammed into the coast of Texas between the small communities of Port Aransas and Port O’Connor. The Category 4 hurricane was soon downgraded to a tropical storm, but it lingered off the Gulf Coast, breaking regional rainfall records. It soon became apparent that flooding was going to become a serious threat to southeast Texas, and in particular to the city of Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States. In the early hours of August 28, rainwater runoff from areas to the west of Houston began to engorge Buffalo Bayou, raising the water to record levels. As the bayou continued to rise, it burst its banks and eventually overflowed the flood wall around the City Hall Annex, flooding two levels of parking and reaching the underside of the ground floor structure of the building. From the upper parking level, the water entered the tunnel that connects the annex to the basement of City Hall, flooding the mechanical and electrical equipment rooms to 4 feet. Engineers Tom Smith, Hussein Moussa, and Steve Done from Arup’s Houston office responded to a request for help from officials at the City of Houston. Based on mayoral direction, their first goal in the aftermath of the storm was to get the departments based at City Hall and the City Hall Annex up and running again, so that they could start to undertake the essential work of helping Houston to rebuild. Smith and Moussa were embedded with staff from the City’s General Services Department and the contracting team to repair and replace the damaged equipment. I spoke with them to learn more about these efforts. We all saw the horrific images coming out of Houston over the past month, but can you give us an idea specifically of the level of damage done to the infrastructure of the City Hall and Annex buildings? Smith: Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the damage has been fairly extensive. Floodwaters destroyed most of the electrical systems in the basements of City Hall Annex and City Hall. Moussa: It also impacted the operation of the domestic water systems, the sewer pumping systems, and the storm pumping systems. In the annex, floodwater made it into the domestic water tank as well. It completely flooded one air-handling unit and made it into a couple of other air handlers where the insulation had gotten wet. It made it into the insulation of some of the chilled water and hot water piping distribution in the building on the lower levels, as well as into some of the exhaust fans and the control panels. There was a lot of repair and replacement work across multiple systems that needed to be done — and done quickly — in order to get the building back up and running so that the government could do everything it could to help the people of Houston recover. Houston's City Hall before Hurricane Harvey How did Arup become a part of that repair and replace effort? Smith: Arup had already been conducting a project with the City around replacing existing electrical switchgear. As they regained access to the flooded areas, I got a call from the project manager at the City to see if we could come down and, given our expertise, help them with the immediate response to the flood damage. Hussein and I have done a fair amount of work and built some strong relationships with the City over the years, and there was really no question — of course we could make ourselves available to assist them in the flood recovery. The storm had a huge impact on our city so it’s great to be able to help in some way. Essentially we stepped into a project-direction role with the City, directing the contractors and liaising amongst teams to facilitate decisions quickly by filling in the knowledge gaps in the different client and contractor experience levels. Moussa: This recovery effort was really important to the mayor, as well. He wanted a show of strength and resiliency for Houston, and he wanted to get the City up and running again as soon as possible so that they could get down to the business of rebuilding and support the citizens. So the goal was to be able to hold a city council meeting in the City Hall chambers on Wednesday morning [September 6]. So we essentially had one week to conduct a project that would ordinarily have spanned maybe 9 to 12 months. Smith: Yeah, it was an exceptionally tight timeframe. We were called in on Wednesday afternoon and spent four or five hours with the contractors and City Hall officials inspecting everything. Since then, Hussein and I have spent an average of 12 to 15 hours here every day. Monday we worked through the night and finished somewhere around noon on Tuesday, after the buildings were reopened. It was a very collaborative job — we were working with both the director and assistant director of the General Services Department, C. J. Messiah and Richard Vella; as well as the manager of the design and construction team, James Reddington; and the division manager of property and facilities, Paul Marro. “ We essentially had one week to conduct a project that would ordinarily have spanned maybe 9 to 12 months. ” Hussein Moussa Associate [email protected] Can you talk us through the scope of repairs that were made? Smith: Technically speaking, it was a straightforward process, working with the contractors to develop testing procedures for all of the equipment that was affected to determine what could be repaired and what needed to be replaced. Mechanically, we’ve replaced all of the motors that were submerged, all of the variable frequency drives that have been submerged, and all the control panels. Basically, every electronic component within the lower two levels of the building have been replaced in the annex. Moussa: We’ve also replaced all equipment, pumps, and connecting units that were submerged. For larger pieces of equipment where only the motors were damaged, the motors were replaced. We didn’t touch the rest of the unit because it was in good shape, but we did make sure to clean it. We also disinfected all the components of the air-handling units so that we were able to use them to circulate air through areas in the building. Environmental work wasn’t specifically in our scope, but we were aware that the floodwaters contained a number of effluents — sewage, oil, other petroleum products — so all of the equipment and surfaces were power-washed as part of the repair review and the mechanical and electrical rooms were dehumidified. Flooding in Buffalo Bayou, beneath the McKee Street Bridge in Houston Were there any specific challenges, beyond the accelerated timeline? Smith: From an equipment-replacement perspective, we have had to source equipment from coast to coast, and even from Canada. So, we’ve had motors coming from Washington State, a temporary chiller on its way from West Virginia, and we had cables flown in from Canada to assist with the replacement of the bus duct, which facilitated the electrical distribution. We couldn’t replace those ducts in the timeframe we needed, so we used cable instead, which means we’ve installed in excess of 20,000 feet of cable in the past week. That kind of sourcing would be challenging in a tight timeframe anyway, but when you add in a holiday weekend, it starts to get even more complicated. Moussa: And the challenges didn’t stop with the actual replacement and repair. Once we had all those pieces in place, we had to have a strategic phased start-up for the equipment so that the systems could come online without overpowering the new switchgear and the new power system in the building. That meant not only coming online gradually, but also making some split-second decisions on-site. “ Hussein and I have done a fair amount of work and built some strong relationships with the City over the years, and there was really no question — of course we could make ourselves available to assist them in the flood recovery. ” Tom Smith Associate [email protected] Is Arup working on any other building repairs following Harvey? Smith: There are many buildings across the city that will need repairs — so far we’re also working on six other buildings. The municipal courthouse was completely flooded in the basement level and the mechanical room was under 15 feet of water. There are also two police buildings, including one which holds the police communications systems. As part of the recovery effort, Arup will be undertaking a risk and resilience review of the MEP [mechanical, electrical, and plumbing] systems associated with the police communications building and trying to ensure that they never lose police communications, from a public life-safety perspective.

131,Making art out of a university building,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/making-art-out-of-a-university-building,,"I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work on the Arts West Redevelopment at the University of Melbourne, which was designed by ARM & Architectus. The project incorporated new teaching and learning spaces and the enclosure of an existing courtyard to form an atrium in amongst old and new buildings. In addition to guiding the project to a 5 star Green Star rating, we analysed the atrium design to holistically understand likely conditions in the space. The atrium was proposed to be naturally ventilated with a significant amount of roof glazing and both transient and non-transient spaces, such as elevated walkways, stairs and seated areas. This makes for an interesting and dynamic space, with sunlight shifting around the space over the course of the day and penetrating to varying degrees, as well as retaining strong links to the outdoors. However, the design also had the potential to cause thermal discomfort, condensation and hot surfaces in some locations under certain conditions. We undertook both daylighting and dynamic thermal modelling to understand the performance of the atrium glazing and the degree of mechanical ventilation provided by smoke exhaust fans to supplement the natural ventilation under peak thermal conditions. For the atrium glazing, we were particularly interested in the visible light transmittance (VLT; the amount of light in the visible portion of the spectrum that passes through the glazing) and solar height gain coefficient (SHGC; the amount of solar radiation that is transmitted). “ We related the analysis back to thermal comfort criteria (SET* in this case) to understand the tangible implications for occupants and the likely levels of thermal discomfort. ” Lauren Clay Building Physics Engineer For example, from a thermal comfort perspective, it is usually beneficial to reduce the solar gains (reduce the glass SHGC). However, from a glass performance perspective, a lower SHGC generally results in a lower VLT, which can be detrimental for the daylighting performance. Therefore, we needed to achieve a balance and we made a number of design and operational recommendations to achieve this, including a recommended SHGC and VLT in the range of readily available glass performance, localised shading for areas with seating on the elevated walkways, installation of sensors to monitor temperatures at various heights within the atrium and minimum mechanical exhaust rates for peak summer conditions, with the potential to run overnight for consecutive hot days to flush the space. We primarily focused on passive strategies (e.g. glass performance), but also provided advice around operational, active strategies (e.g. provision of local shading and use of the smoke exhaust fans). This enabled the atrium to remain unconditioned, as per the design intent, all whilst making use of existing design features (e.g. making use of the smoke exhaust fans that need to be incorporated for regulative purposes) to optimise likely conditions in the space year-round. In parallel to the daylight and thermal analysis, we also considered the condensation risk of the glazed roof design. In Melbourne, condensation is likely to form on the interior glass surface when the internal glass temperature is lower than the dew-point temperature of the adjacent air. Factors affecting the glass temperature include the outside temperature and the thermal characteristics of the glazing system. Given that the atrium is naturally ventilated, the number of people in the space and their activities will influence the humidity levels. The roof design consists of glazing and structural beams that form a thermal bridge from outside to inside. We looked at the glazing and structural beams individually. This was because condensation forming on the beams could be mitigated during construction (e.g. by adding insulation, drip trays or cladding), whereas the glass performance needed to be addressed in the design stage. We looked at the worst case scenario for the glazing, which was a winter's morning, firstly when there are no occupants and then also mid-morning, when it is still fairly cold but humidity levels are raised due to occupants. We identified that double glazing would minimise the risk of condensation forming on the glass for a number of scenarios, whereas single glazing could result in condensation. For the single glazing case, we identified that the risk of condensation forming was very sensitive to the occupancy levels and outside temperatures, both of which are hard to predict at any given point. This really highlighted the need for double glazing to be incorporated to provide comfort that condensation would be unlikely to occur. Finally, we also investigated the health and safety risk associated with metal handrails in atrium getting hot when in direct sun. Two mechanism of impact were considered, including direct burn and discomfort leading to a trip/fall. These were compared to the existing risk associated with metal handrails and seating elsewhere on campus that are exposed to direct sun. As part of the risk analysis, we considered the probability of occurrence of various peak environmental conditions, the corresponding likely handrail temperatures and the potential consequences. We ultimately concluded there was a low-medium risk of health and safety impacts and identified a series of potential control measures to further minimise the risk, including material selection, localised shading and operational controls. “ By undertaking a series of analyses, we were able to holistically approach the design and optimise likely space conditions to ensure an actively used space throughout the course of the year. ” Lauren Clay Building Physics Engineer"
132,Cities Alive: Rethinking legacy for host cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-alive-rethinking-legacy-for-host-cities,,"Legacy 2.0: how public need is reshaping Games design Major sporting and leisure events are under scrutiny like never before to deliver long term benefits for their host city, and the citizens within them. Host cities have been struggling to convince their citizens that they are worth the investment and the upheaval. Hosting an event places a city in the spotlight like nothing else. But when the event is over, cities face increasing demands to demonstrate the long lasting benefits the event has delivered for its citizens. With games in the near future being awarded to cities that are largely already “games-ready” in terms of infrastructure and venues, future events carry the risk of no tangible legacy at all. Designing a longer-lasting legacy Arup is rethinking legacy. As a firm with a long history of the development and design of major sporting venues across the world, we’ve conducted a study into the changing nature of successful legacy. From venue optimisation, through to innovative finance models securing long term investment, we believe there are new ways to help cities achieve long term value and increased civic engagement through hosting.

Legacy 2.0 is about placing socio-economic and city resilience outcomes at the centre of event planning. ” Jerome Frost Director With an eye to events beyond 2020, organising committees and host cities are beginning to reconsider legacy priorities, placing a more central focus on citizen’s benefit and community value. The new era of hosting major events should be defined by the use of existing or temporary venues, maximising the host city’s operational efficiency, minimising cost and reducing the risk of unused venues post-Games. The ‘shock’ of hosting a major event has the potential to challenge a city’s resilience. But getting legacy right has the capacity to strengthen it. Publications Cities Alive: Rethinking legacy for host cities From venue optimisation, through to innovative finance models securing long term investment, we believe there are new ways to help cities achieve long term value and increased civic engagement through hosting. Download Winning behaviours It might seem an obvious question, but it’s often the unasked one: what do cities want their populations to be able to do once the games are over? Focusing on the behavioural legacy of investment is the best way to design future value. Cities need to see the games as a ‘partner’ in helping them deliver solutions to meet the growing longer-term challenges they are facing. They should be a focal point for citizen engagement and galvanise investment momentum so that the post-games infrastructure becomes part of the city’s social fabric. So how do you design for behavioural legacy? Arup’s team have identified three tactics: Urban overlay Urban overlay is a multi-phase ethos that finds innovative ways to enthuse and inspire the local community before, during and long after an event is over. By using longer-term temporary infrastructure and staging event-themed cultural activities, communities deepen their connection to the site and places can be transformed well ahead of their permanent form. Operational excellence Operational excellence requires live, in-depth understanding of public behaviour and being organised to respond to it. Games time operational models can also embed future resilience. At the 2012 London Games, the multi-modal Transport Coordination Centre was the nerve centre which managed London’s transport in real-time. It demonstrated how responsive public transport could be, even under intense pressure. This organisational model has since been reused on other complex urban events such as the London marathon. Cleaner and greener infrastructure Cleaner and greener infrastructure is a win-win opportunity to take action on climate change through hard and soft infrastructure and widespread shifts in behaviour. A low emissions zone can improve air quality around venues. Flood protection and retention initiatives can be designed into new public leisure areas. And new parks that improve air quality will also help future generations lead healthier, more active lifestyles.

At the State Library of NSW on Tuesday, 29 August, more than 100 people from industries relating to the built environment came together to hear from an expert panel on the changing nature of place. 1 of 2 Tim Horton, Registrar of the NSW Architects Registration Board Facilitated by award winning architect, Tim Horton, the discussion went from strength to strength as the panel heated up while addressing some of the big issues in urban design in Australia. Soft infrastructure and a sense of inclusion were front and centre as the group identified these as two key features that make a place great. Justin Madden explained that the venue itself was a great example of this. “ A library is a very inclusive environment. It’s not selective. Anyone can come to a library and do the reading and study they want. That’s what makes it a great place. ” Justin Madden Cities Consultant Alison Page rallied for designers to find a fixed home in Australian government, arguing that as trained communicators, problem solvers and lateral thinkers, there is an opportunity for designers to support positive change in placemaking in Australia. Kylie Legge gave some insight into the community consultation processes influencing placemaking and highlighted the value in educating the community on what is possible. Kylie suggested that there aren’t enough case studies that demonstrate the positive impacts of change in local communities to support the process. Training the community to speak the same language as placemakers was Kylie’s advice to help achieve better outcomes. Shaping our City: Place To view this video, you must enable cookies."

Designing for urban childhoods inspires us to respond positively to the challenges, and sets out actions that can help take us to a more child-friendly future – moving well beyond simply providing playgrounds. The amount of time children spend playing outdoors, their ability to get around independently, and their level of contact with nature are strong indicators of how a city is performing, not just for children but for all generations of city dwellers. If cities fail to address the needs of children, they risk economic and cultural impacts as families move away.

135,"Rates, rubbish and climate leadership: The role of local government in climate resilience ",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/rates-rubbish-and-climate-leadership,,"Received a rates notice lately? There’s a good chance your local government is more than just roads, rates and rubbish. That’s right, cities and sub national governments are now leading the way on climate action. During the recent Ecocity World Summit we heard numerous examples of where local governments (particularly) have been stepping up to take bold action, often in the face of national political squabbling and inaction. In an ever urbanising world, and with concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions largely focused in the city environments, their role in shaping our climate future should not be underestimated. Indeed that over 350 mayors in the US recently committed to upholding the national pledge to the Paris accord, despite Donald Trump withdrawing the country from the global deal, speaks volumes in this regard. The trend towards local action on climate change is becoming increasingly global, particularly through investment in renewable energy and reducing emissions. Countless cities and municipalities are committing themselves to ambitious targets of zero net emissions by 2050 or earlier. Across Australia most states and territories announced their own policies on renewable energy and emissions reduction. In this vacuum of clear national policy state and local governments are leading the way in addressing climate change and arguably they are best placed to do so. There is a growing body of policy makers and advocates who believe the action at the city level is how we are going to fix climate change. They argue that good mayors are pragmatists who can’t get as caught up in the party politics and ideology of other levels of government. Instead, they need to deliver outcomes for their communities, resolve localised issues and provide positive environments for those who live, work or play in their cities. Local governments also have a role for supporting the actions and voices of their own community, which are showing significant interest and investment in local renewable energy. In Germany alone, nearly 50% of installed renewable capacity is owned by communities. Within Victoria, the number of community initiated and run renewable energy projects are growing every year. While investment in renewable energy and reducing emissions is absolutely essential, so too is acknowledging the action needed to adapt. Climate projections under the current business as usual scenarios are terrifying. Climate scientists predict that the north of Australia will likely swelter through endless summers with the projected number of days with temperatures over 35oC predicted to be up to 48 for Cairns, 55 for Brisbane and-over 260 for Darwin by 2090. That’s well within the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren. Projections for sea level rise, droughts, high risk bushfire days and extreme rainfall are not much better. But again, we are seeing positive leadership from cities! Recently, through Arup, I worked with the City of Melbourne, the World Summit hosts, in the refresh of their own climate change adaptation strategy. Since the original strategy in 2009 they have delivered on over 100 actions to enhance the resilience of the city, including substantial work in urban greening and innovative social programs to support people experiencing homelessness through heatwaves. I worked closely with their team to find ways to further push the boundaries of adaptation. The new strategy lays out a clear and ambitious commitment to adapting well to climate change, enabling the city to continue to prosper and thrive. Moreover, as one of the original 100 resilient cities the Greater City of Melbourne, comprising 32 municipalities, is also in the process of completing an assessment of the City Resilience Index developed by Arup in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation. Arup is providing technical assistance to the Chief Resilience Officer in the gathering of data and establishing a baseline of current resilience. Learn more about our work with cities City Resilience Index Deadline 2020: How cities will get the job done Learn more about our work with cities Announced last week Arup will commence a partnership with Hansen on an exciting two year project with the Municipal Association of Victoria, supporting the ten Port Philip Bay councils to embed climate change and coastal adaptation within their planning processes. This is yet another example of local governments stepping up to climate action. In the face of such significant challenges from climate change, we need to embrace leadership at every level. The creativity, passion and energy within our communities is vast and it is through harnessing such resources that we will see a world of equity, safety and prosperity, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive."

Arup was founded on a belief of doing work which leaves a positive legacy for subsequent generations and this consequently feeds into our unique perspective on climate change. We have identified four key areas that are of strategic importance to our clients. Our cities, transport, energy and water resources are all under immense pressure due to rapid urbanisation, improved mobility, rising energy demand and water scarcity. By addressing these challenges together with our clients we will play an important part in mitigating the impacts of climate change. Climate change is happening now. It is having a devastating impact on the lives of ordinary people around the world. We can’t tackle the problem on our own, but through collaboration and partnerships, helping cities to become more resilient and advising on the transition to lower carbon energy sources, we hope to be a catalyst for change.

We are actively encouraging collaboration and partnership on every continent. For example, we have committed $1 million of professional support to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group – 82 cities dedicated to addressing climate change. As a result, we have gained unparalleled insights and crucial data to help cities deliver effective climate change strategies. Michael Bloomberg, the UN Special Envoy on Cities and Climate Change, asked us to assess how cities are working together on their city climate initiatives. The research estimates that cumulative emissions savings by cities could reach 13 GtCO2e by 2050 – equivalent to the combined annual emissions of China and India. That’s how valuable collaboration and sharing can be. Cities need practical tools to battle climate change. So, working with the Rockefeller Foundation, we have developed the City Resilience Index comprising evidence and knowledge, from more than 150 sources, including 14 city case studies and the output from fieldwork in six cities. The Framework enables cities to understand their resilience, shape urban planning and choose appropriate investments. Similarly, Arup and The Open Data Institute (ODI), an independent, non-profit, non-partisan body founded to inspire innovation with data, has brought together public, private and academic experts to design, share and use information about cities which prioritises the needs of people and the imperative of climate change. (The ODI was founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt). Resilience and adaptation A changing climate poses a critical challenge to how we improve our cities’ resiliency and adapt our buildings and infrastructure. Our technical expertise, combined with an in-depth understanding of the built environment, enables us to help a wide range of clients address the impacts of climate change.

New construction techniques, alternative materials and innovative technologies enable us to retrofit old, and design new, buildings and structures to withstand the current and predicted impacts of climate change. Following the devastating earthquake in 2011, we’ve worked with the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, on the ‘Sensing City’ project to embed sensors into the city’s infrastructure – such as roads, energy and water systems – to collect valuable data on the environmental stresses these assets endure on a daily basis. It means we can respond to changes which are occurring, before the strains become critical. We are also re-thinking our approach to designing infrastructure. In the UK, we’re working with Leeds City Council on installing innovative moveable weirs as part of a critical Flood Alleviation Scheme to protect the city. Knowledge such as this can be shared through the Flood Hazard Assessment and Adaptation Toolkits we’ve devised for cities facing sea level rise and increased flood risk. Elsewhere in the world, we’re introducing clients to new technologies and techniques, such as using bio-facades to produce biomass energy and capture solar thermal heat, and concepts such as vertical farming and urban foraging, which could boost food production and natural resources. And we’re encouraging strategic and intelligent use of renewable materials, such as timber, and reclaimed materials on built environment projects. Shared problems call for shared solutions. We’re helping to make the business case by looking at the economics of resilience so our clients can justify their investment in climate action. Publications Climate Action in Megacities (CAM 3.0) Climate Action in Megacities (CAM 3.0) looks at how the world’s greatest cities are forging a pathway to low carbon and climate resilient development, recognising climate risks and taking more action on climate adaptation, as well as mitigation. Download Transitional energy sources The energy trilemma – how to balance sustainability, cost and security of supply – is on the minds of city leaders around the world. The solution is a strategy based on a broad energy mix of lower carbon sources whilst we develop low-carbon renewable alternatives. Can climate change be reversed? Our experts argue that it can, but as this film highlights there is an urgent need to reduce our energy consumption and transition to lower carbon energy sources.

Developing a strategy to tackle the trilemma, and meet our carbon emission targets to limit global warming, requires a balanced and collaborative approach. In response, we work with our clients to help meet their energy and carbon challenges by drawing on relevant, real-world expertise in financial modelling, energy, infrastructure and more. Our renewable energy centre of excellence in South Africa is helping secure a reliable and sustainable alternative to the ageing coal-based generating capacity the country has relied on until now. We’ve advised on the development of the 75MW Kalkbult photovoltaic (PV) plant, the 73.8MW Nobelsfontein wind farm and the Rosherville research facility (the first of its kind in Africa). In Hong Kong our expertise led to our design team developing a self-sufficient and sustainable solution to dispose of up to 2,000 tonnes of sewage sludge per day in the largest incinerator of its type in the world. The heat generated is recovered for power generation, and power surplus to the plant’s requirements is exported to the regional electricity grid. We’ve helped realise over 100GW of geothermal power in countries including Australia, China, Nigeria and Colombia. In Europe, we’ve conducted a study looking at the CO2 generated by infrastructure to plan future Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) facilities across Europe. CCS is one of the only technologies capable of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from large-scale fossil fuel usage, so it has the potential to solve the energy crisis in an environmentally acceptable way. More broadly, low-carbon energy solutions such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, marine and nuclear power, zero net energy schemes, microgrids and district heating all have a part to play in addressing the energy trilemma. At Arup, we work with leading organisations and academics to ensure that we are at the forefront of the research and development of transitional and renewable energy sources.

138,350 years on from London’s Great Fire  – The role of the fire engineer in building the modern city,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/350-years-fire-london,,"350 years ago, a great fire devastated London. Much of the city was destroyed and thousands made homeless. A combination of unregulated urban sprawl, narrow streets, no fire service and highly flammable construction materials faciliated the devastating spread. In the aftermath, a new, more fire conscious approach was developed to prevent such an event occurring again. The early Fire Brigade was born, streets were widened and the London Building Act of 1667 was introduced. The Act restricted the use of wood and thatch in favour of less combustible materials such as brick and stone, and Londoners were forbidden from building houses taller than four storeys high. In addition, surveyors were appointed to enforce the new regulations. 350 years ago, a great fire devastated London. Much of the city was destroyed and thousands made homeless.

With society now placing greater value on sustainability, there has recently been a renewed interest in wood as a building material and we are starting to see the introduction of other combustible materials into our built enviroment such as eco-plastics and foams. “ Modern methods of construction are changing and going back to being as combustible as they were then. All of those challenges at a city scale are starting to re-emerge. ” Barbara Lane Director These comparatively new materials might solve one set of challenges of the modern built environment but are more susceptible to burn than conventional materials such as concrete or steel. They therefore require increasingly innovative solutions, tools and technologies to mitigate fire risks. Ambitious projects At the time of the Great Fire of London, most buildings were low-rise and were easy to evacuate. Despite the devastation wrought by the 1666 fire, few people died in the flames because they were able to get out of their homes quickly. Today, many of us live in multi-storey buildings where evacuation procedures can be less straightforward. Public buildings like Birmingham New Street railway station pose challenges of complexity and scale. In addition, mixed-use projects such as the Marina Bay Sands illustrate the challenges of variations in occupancy patterns across the day and night as hotel guests, casino visitors and shoppers come and go. Arup’s Fire Engineers use the latest research and technology to respond to these challenges. Some of this work takes place in a laboratory setting as we seek to understand how construction materials behave during a fire. For example, we are working closely with a team of research engineers at the University of Edinburgh to explore the fundamental behaviours of timber and wood-based materials. If we can better understand the properties of such materials, our teams can push boundaries with timber-based designs to create buildings that are safe, beautiful and a pleasure to live in. “ … all relevant design decisions have been considered together and have been integrated into a whole by a well organised team empowered to fix priorities… excellence depends on it.” ” Sir Ove Arup Founder New tools and technology It’s not just building materials that have evolved since the fire of 1666. Architects and engineers also benefit from using computers to inform their approach to the built environment. Our fire engineers employ visualisation tools such as MassMotion crowd simulation software that helps us understand how large crowds might flow through structures, helping devise effective evacuation procedures, even at times of peak congestion.

139,Cities Alive  – Green Building Envelope,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-alive-green-building-envelope,,"Towards a cleaner, greener, and healthier human ecosystem Over time, the human population has become increasingly urban, with city centres becoming more and more densely populated. In these dense city spaces, there is little room for ‘green infrastructure’ – parks, trees and other green spaces. The impact of this depletion is underestimated, as urbanisation and climate change continue to jeopardise our way of life. Cities Alive: Green Building Envelope, shows how a collaborative team of Arup specialists from across the world, set out to tackle these issues head on. The report explores the application of green infrastructure to the surfaces of both new and existing inner-city buildings in five major global cities – Berlin, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne and Hong Kong - to create a positive future for inhabitants. Our report reveals that, out of the five case studies, London has the most to gain by introducing green walls to reduce pollution. Green façades can have a major impact on air quality and also reducing urban heat. Discover more Download the report Discover our expertise Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

Understanding the strains that modern urbanisation places on our cities and their inhabitants is crucial, and our report looks to explore potential solutions to the wider problem. “ We – as humans – are inherently tied to nature and, more specifically, to vegetation; utilising land for crops, trees for shade and oxygen to breathe. ” Josef Hargrave Global Foresight Leader Reducing urban stress As our ever-expanding cities become more densely compacted, ‘grey’ structures are a source of untapped potential, where ‘green’ spaces can make cities more attractive and resilient, as vegetation filters fine particles from the air. The effective introduction of green building envelopes can result in local reduction in pollution of around 10-20%. Capturing renewable energy using wind turbines and bio-reactive façades such as SolarLeaf in Hamburg, can drive sustainability in built-up environments. While, harnessing urban agriculture initiatives like vertical farming, beehives and wildlife corridors, can deliver better air quality. We explore how these initiatives must work in tandem towards this ultimate greener and cleaner goal. 1 of 2 Of the case study cities, Berlin has a low Urban Heat Island effect. However, it has high levels of air pollution and needs more green infrastructure to reduce the level of harmful contaminants. Creating cooler cities Metropolitan hardscapes, such as concrete and glass, have a huge impact on the ambient temperature of the environment, as solid surfaces radiate rather than absorb heat. This increased heat takes a toll on urban spaces, and can affect water quality, cause heat-related illnesses and cause an increase in mortality rates. Our report reveals that the quantity and quality of vegetation within a city can reduce temperatures and the Urban Heat Island effect. Retrofitting cityscapes with green infrastructure, such as moss walls and tree façades improves aesthetics, well-being, and the cooling potential of buildings. CapitaGreen in Singapore demonstrates how green building envelopes can reduce solar heat gain and lower surface temperatures.

140,Cities Alive  – Lighting the urban night-time,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-alive-lighting-the-urban-night-time,,"How light shapes 24-hour cities Lighting designers have joined fellow urbanists to rewrite the night. It is time to consider life after dark. Today's cities are alive 24 hours. Yet all too often town planners apply their work to the daylight hours. They neglect the potential of night-time lighting to shape urban life after dark and support 24/7 economies. With darkness accounting for 50% of the world’s time, that potential is huge. Well-designed night-time lighting can influence the way you use and enjoy a city, the way you move around its streets and even the way you feel. 1 of 2 City Park, Bradford - Carefully balanced lighting provides a flexible, fun and functional night-time setting for the park. The power of night-time lighting Have you ever stopped, for instance, to wonder why you take a certain route home at night or feel safe here but not there? Chances are it has to do with how public spaces are lit. The right night-time lighting can make shift workers feel safe on after-dark commutes. It can make you more likely to walk or take public transport. And it can encourage you to socialise outdoors at night, contributing to its night-time economy. “ Urban lighting isn’t just about meeting safety needs through code compliance, or achieving an aesthetic effect. It presents a significant opportunity to fundamentally improve the quality of life of urban citizens. Properly considered, lighting can positively impact the ‘total architecture’ of our cities; reinforcing urban design principles, enhancing cultural experiences and encouraging social interaction. ” Florence Lam Director We were commissioned to improve the lighting of the garden in London’s famous Leicester Square. We noticed that it wasn’t being used to its full potential at night and set about analysing people’s movements within the space, then transforming it with light. We revealed how lighting can affect where we go, when we go and which route we take. Watch the film to find out more about how the use of light can transform urban spaces at night.

Answering this question involves understanding things like how people want to use city spaces, how light affects our bodies and our behaviours, and why we need darkness too. So creating effective night-time lighting requires expertise in lighting design, urban planning and sociology. In researching our report, we brought together experts from different disciplines to discuss the importance of lighting, and what needs to be considered when planning our cities. Watch this film to discover how lighting experts from different disciplines come together to discuss the importance of lighting, and what needs to be considered when planning our cities.

The role that urban lighting will play in future cities will be influenced by a multitude of social, technological, economic, environmental and political factors. Cities will need to be more resilient to the challenges of the future, while also being safe and fun places to live. In collaboration with Arup’s Foresight, Research and Innovation team, we have created an animation to communicate our vision for the future of urban lighting, which encompasses the multiple ways lighting can shape future urban environment by 2053. The animation explores how lighting technology and design solutions may contribute to achieving city resilience and sustainability and how a new approach to public lighting will allow transport infrastructure to be shaped with humans, not cars in mind; urban plazas to thrive with participation; and cities to conquer dark skies after a century for humans and wildlife to enjoy, while using natural light at its best potential during daytime.

As shown in our Design Book: 50 city stories explored, this might mean taking steps to increase safety for workers in a given industry – as we did for the garment manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. Or it might be something as outwardly simple as applying our operational readiness knowhow to prepare a new hospital or airport to ensure things run smoothly from day one. Lasting change “ A successful city needs a plan for the future… Such long-term planning is important to the liveability of any city.

One positive result was that it prompted investment in rebuilding damaged properties and in the long-term regeneration of the area. We’ve worked with the local community on the strategy for regeneration and have secured a loan guarantee for new infrastructure – reducing some of the risk previously associated with investment in this area. Our work is contributing to the local council’s plans for change. Between now and 2025, 5,000 jobs will be created, 10,000 homes will be built and more green public space will make Tottenham a better place to live and work. Can a community use a negative event as an impetus for change? Arup has been commissioned by the Mayor of London and Haringey Council to lead a team developing a plan to regenerate Tottenham after the 2011 London riots To view this video, you must enable cookies. New infrastructure benefits a city as a whole for many years. Crossrail, for example, is a 118km railway line passing under London. The aim is that the high-frequency east-west line will increase London’s below-surface rail capacity by 10%, it will also stimulate development above the new stations and along the route. Future aspirations are high, but what about today? A central part of our role has been ensuring that tunnelling under the city doesn’t affect life above ground. We’ve carefully assessed and monitored the impact of the tunnelling on 17,000 structures along the route, as well as underground utilities and London Underground. Design for future needs Can you design now to meet future needs? We think so. The White Collar Factory is a blueprint for office design developed for property investor and developer Derwent London. The goal was to anticipate tomorrow’s tenants’ needs before they were expressed, rather than simply responding to today’s design trends. It’s a model for the workplace of the future. New ideas of course need to be tested and proven. In Hansung City in Qingdao, China, we were asked to develop a test site for micro-energy grid (MEG) technology – which can reduce energy usage, carbon emissions and costs. The technology means energy can be directed to where it is needed and when. Residents have access to the information they need to monitor and reduce their own energy use. It’s true people power.

142,Design Book  – Future Cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/design-book-future-cities,,"How today’s decisions shape the cities of tomorrow Delivering desired future outcomes for cities can pose a number of challenges. But, as we show in our Design Book: 50 city stories explored, it doesn’t matter if the goal is encouraging growth, developing infrastructure, or planning for an increase in population. The planning starts now. “ We’ve got the need, we’ve got the obligation, frankly, to try and make cities as good as they can be. Because future generations are going to live with what we do. ” Gregory Hodkinson Former Chair of Arup Group Gregory Hodkinson , Arup Group Chairman, on city complexity and the pressures cities face today To view this video, you must enable cookies. Infrastructure projects are one of the biggest enablers of economic growth in cities. With timelines often stretching across decades, each phase of the planning must be carefully orchestrated to make the greatest possible impact. In Foshan, Guanzhong, we are supporting the economic case for a new metro line by ensuring that stations are optimally-placed to prompt development. Managing the built-up city Without the luxury of starting from scratch, most projects must fit within a city's existing footprint. Nowhere is this better shown than Shanghai. We started work there three decades ago, on the city’s first skyscraper. Since then, Shanghai has become a megacity, symbolic of China’s economic rise. 1 of 2 Enter image caption here We have been involved in numerous projects in Shanghai that maximise the limited opportunities for new growth. One project of note is our plan to redevelop Shanghai’s 2010 World Expo site into a business, leisure and exhibition centre. And in Xinzhuang TOD Town, we’re expanding above an existing station. It will become a multi-mode transport centre, with residential and commercial space overhead. “ Just 30 years ago, we built the Hilton Hotel. In photos you can see you could have built almost anywhere at the time. Now there’s no space: you have to find gaps and create places. Because the city is so developed, you have to start building where it’s technically very difficult. That change is absolutely amazing. ” Michael Kwok East Asia Region Chair At a micro-level, the ancient shopping streets of Dashilar are proof that even the smallest projects can have a transformative effect. In this congested part of Beijing, the moveable street bench we designed acts as a parking barrier, a place to sit and somewhere to lock up bicycles. It’s simple, but effective. Planning for tomorrow’s challenges Cities are experiencing more change now than at any other time. As our work in northern Melbourne shows, plans made today will shape the city for the next generation. Urbanisation is driving record population growth in the Australian city; our 50-year plan is phased so that new transport and social infrastructure will be in place when they’re needed. That’s what we call future-proofing. Design Book: 50 city stories explored Read an electronic version of the Design Book Download Purchase your copy"
143,Design Book  – Green Cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/design-book-green-cities,,"Breathing life back into urban living A greener city is a healthier place for people to live, work and visit. In our Design Book: 50 city stories explored, we show the many benefits of bringing nature into the urban environment. We believe that incorporating green corridors, streets, parks and green space on buildings into a city boosts wellbeing, safety and prosperity. As well as encouraging biodiversity, green space reduces heat and pollution and inspires people to walk or cycle. Green infrastructure can also alleviate flooding and provide resilience against the effects of climate change. At Hunter’s Point South, a wasteland has been brought back to life. This semi-derelict site – with its views of Manhattan’s skyline – offered great opportunities for regeneration and redevelopment. The space also had the potential to become a new, shared community space. The waterfront park we have created is home to new streets, bike-ways and even a dog-run. The community contributed ideas and is now seeing the benefits. The park is regularly used for events of all kinds – from beach volleyball to movie nights and silent discos. It’s a true community hub. New ways of thinking Green space is sometimes vertical. In the heart of a historic area of Milan, Italy, we used our structural know-how to create the Bosco Verticale – a ‘vertical wood’ of 900 cherry, olive and oak trees – up the side of two high-rise residential buildings. The trees offer shade and cleaner air for the residents and are a haven for insect and bird life. They have created a vibrant natural environment on an artificial surface. 1 of 2 The Bosco Verticale in Milan are planted with trees that provide a habitat for birds and insects. Cities Alive, our award-winning report looks at the importance of building nature into urban areas through new developments or retrofitting. “ The wide social, economic and environmental benefits that green delivers in supporting the quality of urban living and providing climate change resilience are becoming better understood. Green space needs to be designed as a fundamental component of a healthy city and urban environment. ” Tom Armour Global Landscape Architecture Leader This approach is evident in London, where we are working with The Crown Estate to creatively introduce more urban green, flora and fauna into its central London property portfolio – via rooftops and public space.

144,Design Book  – Intelligent cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/design-book-intelligent-cities,,"Cities demand design that thinks 'outside the box' Intelligent design is sometimes about new ideas or development. It’s also often about giving cities’ existing assets – buildings, infrastructure and beyond – a new lease of life through well-planned updates. It’s certainly about adapting so cities live within the resources that are available to them. These are some of the intelligent approaches to city design and planning that are revealed in our Design Book: 50 city stories explored. “ What we are really talking about is finding new ways to propel the growth of cities, to build in a new way, to live differently, in just the next ten, 20, 30 years. ” Edgar Pieterse Director of the African Center for Cities Edgar Pieterse, director of the African Center for Cities, talks about the trends driving change in cities in that continent.

In New York, the Fulton Center unites six existing subway stations and 12 subway lines; 300,000 people pass through daily. This new hub incorporates retail space, natural light and the refurbishment of one of New York’s earliest skyscrapers. The design simplifies the transport system for passengers and creates a new focal point for Lower Manhattan. 1 of 2 Fulton Center unites 12 subway lines and six stations Our plans for the new Cityringen network of stations in Copenhagen also needed to work in harmony with the existing city footprint. In contrast, these small-scale, economical stations squeeze into the existing urban space. The light, bright, modular design of their interiors is efficient and functional, with colour cues helping to guide passengers to their destinations. Bringing the new to the old “ Cities are rejuvenated by revitalising and preserving historic icons. It’s like charging the city’s battery. Stations, galleries and industrial buildings given a modern functionality with a beautifully-restored, theatrical backdrop. ” Nigel Tonks Director 1 of 2 The renovated Rijksmuseum is flooded with light We have been involved in the sensitive upgrade of many historic buildings worldwide. The 130-year-old Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is home to priceless works by artists such as Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Vermeer. To bring the museum into the 21st century, we embarked upon a ten-year renovation. We overhauled generations of adaptations and uncovered beautiful internal frescoes and ceilings. The space is now flooded with light, both natural and state-of-the-art artificial. This enhances the space for visitors by illuminating the building’s 19th-century detailing and, most importantly, the art. Simple ideas in action Often smart design is just simple. In Limerick, Ireland, the transport network runs more smoothly since we linked up traffic lights. They now respond to fluctuations in traffic and quickly produce fault alerts if one set of lights isn’t working. Sensors mean buses are given priority at traffic lights. Congestion has been reduced and public transport is more widely used. Simple solutions aren't necessarily new. Wood is one of the oldest building materials, but it is back at the heart of innovation. We co-funded research at the LifeCycle Tower to determine whether wood can be used for a 40-storey building. It seems counter-intuitive in a world where tall buildings are more often steel structures, but we’re disproving concerns about acoustics and fire safety. We are now designing a 20-storey timber building in Austria. Design Book: 50 city stories explored Read an electronic version of the Design Book Download Purchase your copy"

But how we respond to them is very much within our control. Resilient cities, as revealed in our Design Book: 50 city stories explored, can weather both shocks and stresses resulting from many causes, including the effects of climate change. Small-scale solutions can sometimes do as much as big ideas to help cities plan for known threats and react efficiently to unexpected ones. Strong foundations Rooting out vulnerabilities and applying resilience thinking at all levels – local to global – is a crucial step in tackling future problems. “ Everyone – business, government, civic society, academia and NGOs – has a role to play in building resilience, and everyone stands to benefit. ” Judith Rodin President of The Rockefeller Institute. Globally, our work with The Rockefeller Foundation has led to the creation of the City Resilience Framework and Index. For the first time, this sets out a way for cities to understand, assess and measure their own resilience. As a result, they will be better able to share ideas and learning, as well as planning and investing to ensure urban communities are well-placed to survive and thrive a broad spectrum of risk. Of course, it is not just large-scale initiatives that make a difference. Community groups can transform cities’ ability to be resilient. Our work with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent is reducing risk at this micro level. By looking beyond infrastructure solutions, to identify factors that aid social cohesion within and between communities, we’re helping prepare them to tackle challenges better, together. 1 of 2 Fieldwork with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Rebuilding better No city is immune to natural disasters, but they can learn from previous events. In New York and New Jersey, we’ve been working with local communities and the government to rebuild after 2012’s Hurricane Sandy. We’re developing and executing plans to ensure areas can withstand the ongoing threat of flooding and rising sea levels. We’ve used small-scale initiatives that cumulatively – and cleverly – make a big difference. Projects have ranged from helping to develop action plans for the rebuilding of communities and damaged housing stock to the design of a waterside community that can bounce back quickly from flooding. Rising to the challenge Tackling the problem itself is also crucial. Ninety-eight percent of the C40 cities have said that climate change presents a significant challenge to them. Working with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, we used data from more than 200 cities to estimate what the impact on our climate in 2050 would be if 3,000 cities took the same steps to reduce emissions. Together, we can effect real change. “ Cities have the power, the expertise, the political will and the resourcefulness to continue to take meaningful climate action.

The historic elements of a city also form its character. Preserving this heritage while encouraging evolution requires a delicate balance. Awe-inspiring spaces “ As humans, we are drawn to the odd, the unusual, the idiosyncratic. It is not illogical, barmy or stupid.

It is a ‘statement‘ building that will inspire locals and attract tourists. 1 of 2 The National Taichung Theater was dubbed the ‘unbuildable building’ Buildings should both enhance and respond to the wider city. The skyline was a key consideration in our design for the Singapore Sports Hub. The government didn’t just want a world-class sports facility near the city centre; it wanted a building that retained a connection with the city. The horseshoe-shaped venue has an open end, framing a view of the city skyline. An addition to the cityscape itself, the hub is topped by a spectacular moveable ultra-thin roof: the world’s largest freestanding dome. Beautiful buildings like the Glasgow School of Art’s Reid Building can be inspiring.

147,Cities Alive – Rethinking green infrastructure,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-alive-rethinking-green-infrastructure,,"Can nature help restore harmony in our cities? Our cities are facing an uncertain future. Underground roads and automated transport, permeable pavements and water roofs, vertical farming and even glowing trees – from large-scale interventions to smaller scale enrichments, cities in the future will need to look vastly different to cities now. Cities Alive – Rethinking green infrastructure – shows how the creation of a linked ‘city ecosystem’ that encompasses parks and open spaces; urban trees, streets, squares; woodland and waterways can help create healthier, safer and more prosperous cities. To realise this vision, green infrastructure has to now take a more influential role in the planning and design of cities and urban environments. Five key requirements Supported by the Landscape Institute and Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, Cities Alive leads us to five key requirements with significant implications for the future design of cities. 1. We need to recognise ‘urban green’ as more than an aesthetic consideration – it’s a fundamental part of an urban ‘ecosystem’ which improves social interaction and physical and mental health 2. We must make landscapes work harder, for multiple end-users and to improve climate change resilience, through a multi-functional design approach 3. Design creativity is needed to deliver a green city ecosystem – from both city-wide strategic projects down to more imaginative uses of space within the layers of a city 4. By capitalising on advances in technology to measure the value that nature delivers through ecosystems services, we can optimise the planning and design of urban space to meet future demands 5. We need an integrated approach to delivery that better links and connects policy to transgress ‘silo-driven’ cultures and achieve long term benefits.

148,Building high-rise better  – ground-breaking design realises the world's most inventive skyscrapers,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/tall-buildings,,"Have you ever wondered what makes it possible to create the folding structure of the CCTV building, or the circular form of Aldar Headquarters? Arup’s structural engineering and design expertise is behind some of the most ambitious tall structures in the world. This updated animation looks at the tall buildings projects Arup has worked on over the past 30 years. To view this video, you must enable cookies. Arup is recognised as one of the most significant structural engineers behind some of the world’s tallest buildings. In the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat’s ""100 of the World’s Tallest Buildings"" (2015) Arup had worked on 17 of the projects highlighted. Following 9/11, Two International Finance Centre in Hong Kong set new standards for resilient high-rise design. And projects such as One Central Park, 1 Bligh Street and Heron Tower show how just how efficient tall buildings can be in terms of costs, materials and energy. At 30 St Mary Axe (‘The Gherkin’), we showed how a diagrid structure can create column-free spaces and use less material. It’s an approach we employed on a vast scale for the Guangzhou International Finance Centre – a 103-storey super skyscraper that must withstand South China’s typhoons. “ With 70% of the world’s population expected to be living in urban areas by 2050, the demands placed on those cities will be considerable. Well-engineered, safe, efficient and smart tall buildings will have an increasing role to play in meeting those demands. ” Craig Gibbons Arup Fellow New thinking at every level Much of our innovation is in response to a project’s local conditions and limitations. In highly seismic areas our patented outrigger damper systems reduces the cost of tall structures, something we achieved on the Saint Francis Shangri-la Place in Manila. In developing economies it’s not just a matter of getting the building design right, you also need to consider market conditions, including the available materials, skills and machinery. Working on Goldin Finance 117 in Tianjin, the structural columns we needed were so large that we couldn’t find a manufacturer that could fabricate them off-site. To overcome this problem we modified the design, and small sections were made, held in position by a crane, then welded to the top of the rest of the column in the air. Craig Gibbons, an Arup Fellow, talks about his area of expertise - the structural design of of high-rise towers, including the circular Aldar HQ and Two International Finance Centre.

The 57 storey Torre Reforma building in Mexico is the tallest building in Latin America. Arup’s geotechnical and structural teams building have designed it to withstand a ‘1 in a 2500 year’ seismic event, making it one the most secure buildings in the region.

Arup constantly experiments with materials, and we’ve been researching and prototyping the use of cross-laminated timber in structures like the LifeCycleTower. We could soon see wooden buildings over 20 storeys in Switzerland and Austria, structures that absorb CO2 and play a role in mitigating climate change. This new generation of timber buildings promises to be taller and more sustainable than ever before. Arup’s structural engineering, fire safety, acoustics and building physics team are working on HAUT, in Amsterdam – an innovative 73 metre high, 21 storey timber constructed tower which completes in 2019. We continue to collaborate on timber research in Australia, Austria, the UK and the USA to support the commercialisation of these ideas and approaches. “ Increasing urbanisation means cities will grow up as well as out. Wood can play a big part in building the sustainable high-rise cities of the future. It’s a truly renewable material and it can compete on cost and performance. ” Carsten Hein Associate Director and Timber Competence Team Leader at Arup Germany Arup continues to innovate in tall structures. We created the world’s first bioreactive façade, which uses algae to provide both shading and renewable energy. Il Bosco Verticale in Milan is a relatively modest height, but features a forest planted up the building’s exterior. Our work on the Al Bahr Towers includes a shading system that opens and closes as the sun moves. Elsewhere, our engineers are extending existing buildings upward, integrating vertical farming, and pioneering the safe use of elevators for high-rise fire evacuation. Our rapidly urbanising world’s need for tall buildings is likely to grow. Arup continues to play a central role in the design and engineering of its most ambitious structures.

149,Humanising the workplace,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/humanising-the-workplace,,"Designing workplaces around people improves the health and wellbeing of individuals and organisations A workplace should help you be your very best. Yet all too many offices, factories and laboratories overlook vital human factors that affect employee wellness and impact organisations. The lost workdays, high staff turnover and lower productivity that result is costing businesses dear. In the UK alone, work-related mental health problems cost the economy £26bn every year. Creating the perfect workplace is certainly no easy task. But today employers are realising the potential of workplace designs and strategies that prioritise people. These can help them bring out the best in an increasingly skilled workforce, avoid accidents and incidents at work and improve their operations. Achieving this requires expertise in design, engineering, architecture, workplace strategy, employee health and wellbeing, as well as occupational psychology and people factors. There needs to be an appreciation of how lighting affects health, how acoustics affect concentration and how to create a supportive culture by considering the needs of different users and designing jobs and organisations around them. Putting people first If these people factors are prioritised right from the start of a project, the benefits include efficient, flexible operations as well as attracting and retaining the best staff. In the video below, specialists from across Arup explain why these things are needed now more than ever and how they can be realised. To view this video, you must enable cookies. Setting a new standard for offices Workers today demand more choice and flexibility from an office building than ever before. They want to work in ways that suit them, and to feel valued and trusted. They want spaces that enable them to be creative and connect with other people. And businesses need this too if they’re to be productive and innovative. So by providing this kind of office environment, organisations can realise a host of benefits, from speeding up decision-making to reducing costs and increasing efficiency. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is one organisation that has realised the importance of the human factor. It sees the working environment in its Luxembourg headquarters as key to attracting top talent. By engaging with staff through workshops and surveys, we created a workplace strategy for the EIB to ensure their workplaces can be tailored perfectly to the jobs people do every day. Around the world, demand is growing for office buildings like this that put employee health and wellbeing first. In London, 22 Bishopsgate is setting a new standard for others to follow. It’s designed as a vertical city to provide the 12,000 people who will work there with everything they need to eat, play and relax. Inviting spaces for eating and socialising distributed throughout the building will encourage mindful dining, a meditative concept that encourages people to think carefully about what they’re eating. Active lifestyles will be championed – there will be 1,600 bike parking spaces, changing and repair facilities, a cycling club and spinning classes. A library will provide space to read and relax, while an auditorium will host films and other events. A carefully curated range of shops, strong design and public art will complete a place that people feel proud to inhabit. Our health and wellbeing consultancy, led by Ann Marie Aguilar, is helping 22 Bishopsgate to champion improving health and wellbeing through the built environment. It is the first UK building to be registered under the new WELL Building Standard®, targeting WELL Core and Shell Compliance. In fact, Ann Marie is the first WELL Accredited Professional in the UK. Buildings that meet the WELL performance criteria improve the nutrition, fitness, mood, sleep patterns, and performance of their occupants. Our infographic below highlights just what a difference this can make to an organisation. Creating the human factor(y) Even the biggest industrial workplaces can be built around people, as we explore in our Rethinking the Factory report. Let in the changing hue of natural daylight and workers can relate to the time of day. Provide views to the outside and you create a sense of location. Create shared rest spaces and you foster chance conversations that can spark the next big idea. These game-changing interventions all feature in our design for Jaguar Land Rover’s state-of-the-art UK Engine Manufacturing Centre. They maximise productivity among the 700 people employed there – a figure which is set to double. The same approach informed our work on the award-winning Procter & Gamble Planta Milenio razor and blade factory in Mexico. The Mexican facility’s saw-tooth roof structure lets in daylight – something that’s vital to natural human rhythms – while providing shading and reducing glare from the harsh sunlight. Placing the cafeteria and gymnasium near the main entrance ensures easy access to these common areas, which give workers somewhere to unwind and interact with colleagues at all levels. Revolutionising laboratories Scientific industries are also embracing the idea that bringing people together to work in the right environment can fuel breakthroughs. This is the thinking behind pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline’s revolutionary campus in Stevenage, which we designed some 20 years ago. More recently we have supported the development of the latest generation of laboratories at the site, which focus on people and flexibility. A major hub for early-stage biotechnology companies, the Smartlab campus fosters a culture of open innovation. Previously, scientists from different specialisms such as chemists and biologists would have worked separately. In the new facility, they work together in shared spaces that can be easily reconfigured over a weekend. This enables the scientists to break down the traditional barriers between disciplines and share ideas that could become major innovations. Conclusion Together with our clients, we’re aiming to create a legacy of workplaces that enrich the employee experience. By thinking more deeply about creating workplaces that benefit employee health and wellbeing, organisations can dramatically enhance their operations.

It is strong and light, making it easy to transport and erect. It can also be machined to very high tolerances, making it ideal for prefabrication. New wood products such as CLT (cross laminated timber), and recent advances in computer-controlled manufacturing, now make it an attractive choice for office construction. If acoustics, floor vibration and fire safety are addressed early in the design process, wood can be left exposed – saving on the cost of finishes and adding to the beauty of the interior. This is where our multidisciplinary approach can offer real cost savings. We believe that wood can create office buildings that are attractive, sustainable and affordable. Why use timber? These benefits of timber make it an ideal construction material. Richard Hough explains in this film what makes timber unique, and how that can radically change the construction process.

151,Bridging the Quay with intelligent design,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/bridging-the-quay-with-intelligent-design,,"The $440 million Elizabeth Quay was officially unveiled to the public in January. Part of a bold plan by the Western Australian Government to revitalise central Perth, Elizabeth Quay features a stunning 2.7ha inlet and 1.5ha promenade with bars and restaurants and will eventually be surrounded by a vibrant mix of offices, apartments, hotels and shops. The event also marked the opening of the spectacular new $20 million pedestrian and cyclist bridge, which stands out as the jewel in the crown of the precinct. The 22m high cable-stayed bridge spans the inlet and offers impressive 360 degree views across the Swan River and the Perth CBD and allows for continuous movement around the Quay. Arup was engaged by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority (MRA) and novated to managing contractor CPB Contractors (formerly Leighton Contractors) and Broad as the lead design consultant for the bridge, and worked closely with stakeholders to deliver multi-disciplinary services from concept design through to completion. The design process A bridge as a primary element is a very simple structure; however the Elizabeth Quay bridge presented three core challenges. Firstly, the bridge was to be simple and transparent despite being positioned in constrained location. Secondly, the deck needed to be raised up to a certain level to provide clearance and allow vessels to safely pass underneath it. And thirdly, from a functional point of view the bridge had to have a minimum width of 5m to offer easy access for pedestrians and cyclists to move smoothly across it, including disabled users. Given these challenges, Arup's team of designers knew that the bridge's design needed to be more complex than a simple 'straight line' bridge. The solution was two leaning arches with 45m spans, connecting in the middle, and sweeping down towards the water to rest on concrete piers supported on piles socketed into the rock bed. To ensure that existing views across the river to South Perth were not obstructed, elements’ of transparency were added to the bridge’s balustrades. However, the bridge still needed some level of solidity in order to reduce wind-induced vibrations. Arup’s wind engineers reviewed the bridge to mitigate vibration and overcome potential vortex shedding issues. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Bridge materials Presented with a windy riverside location and the at-times harsh Western Australian climate, in-depth consideration was given to the materials selected for use in the new bridge. Jarrah was selected for the bridge decking, not only because it wears well but because it is native to Western Australia and therefore familiar to many of the people using the bridge. The Jarrah was sourced from the south-west of Western Australia. Because of its durability and in particular its resistance to salt and wind corrosion, stainless steel was selected for the architectural elements such as balustrading. Similarly, concrete was adopted for the foundations and piers. Bringing it all together The delivery of the design for the Elizabeth Quay pedestrian and cyclist bridge took a multi-disciplinary approach, which included Arup’s structural, civil, geotechnical, electrical, wind, materials, maritime and vibration engineering teams and Arup Associates. Arup’s design solution overcame every technical challenge whilst ensuring the bridge’s visual appeal was at the forefront of the design. The final bridge design has delivered everything the MRA and Arup sought to achieve in terms of simple and pure structural forms, complemented by rationalised modular architecture. The bridge is an iconic structure and a key element in the transformation of Perth’s Swan River waterfront.

We’re already reaping the benefits of digital Digital tools like data-driven analysis and BIM (building information modelling) are already helping us improve how buildings are designed and constructed, heighten the experience of the people who interact with them and allow us to analyse how they’ll perform in the long term. All of this has the ability to impact long-term valuation. But fully realising the potential of digital requires property developers and owners of corporate real estate to move away from a tactical use of digital design thinking to a more strategic approach that touches all aspects of their portfolio management.

153,Cities Alive  – Towards a walking world  ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-alive-towards-a-walking-world,,"Walkable cities are better cities for everyone In our new report, Cities Alive: Towards a walking world, we shine a light on walking, and the impact walkability has on the success of a city. In particular, we highlight the opportunity for cities to embrace walking in response to some of the significant societal, environmental and market challenges they are facing. “ From 70 years of practice we know that a walkable city is a better city and that the more we walk the better the city in every respect. ” Gregory Hodkinson Former Chair of Arup Group The report demonstrates the significant social, economic, environmental and political benefits of walking. The health benefits of walking are well-known, an active lifestyle dramatically reduces the likelihood of chronic disease. But there is so much to be gained from encouraging walkability. A walkable city improves mental health, reduces inequality, attracts inward investment, it improves urban micro-climates. As you can see from the illustration below, these are just a few of the 50 benefits we have identified when walking is placed at the heart of urban mobility. 1 of 2 In Brighton, New Road’s successful shared space redesign by Gehl Architects brought a 600% increase in seating. Why walkability needs attention Mobility is intrinsic to the quality of life experienced in cities. But for the past century, the car has dominated how we plan and grow our urban areas. We must now seize the opportunity to place people back at the heart of our cities and drive a human focused approach to the design of the built environment. With a growing desire to create more liveable streets, walkability should be used as a catalyst for developing sustainable, healthy, prosperous and attractive cities. Publications Cities Alive: Towards a walking world Highlighting the significant social, economic, environmental and political benefits of walking, this report details 50 benefits of walking explored through 16 distinct indicative themes, and list 40 actions that city leaders can consider to inform walking policy, strategy and design. Download There are so many reasons why walking can better the urban landscape – and cities are now taking active steps to encourage more walking amongst residents, business and visitors. We give the effect the High Line has had on New York as an example of a major city taking steps to encourage people to get from A to B on foot. “ Walking is better for the planet, better for your mind and better for your body. As it becomes more prevalent, we are forced to design public space and corridors to be pleasant and safe at a human scale. It demands thoughtful and pleasing investments in the public realm."" ” Penny Hulse Deputy Mayor, Auckland City What’s next? Of course, creating a walking world requires action. So how does a city design the built environment to get more people walking? Our report highlights 40 actions that cities can take to inform the design of their own walking policies and strategies; and includes a series of 80 case studies that provide inspiration. Take Madinat al Irfan for instance, which creates a comfortable walking environment for citizens in high heat. Or Singapore’s Marina Bay Waterfront – who worked with Arup to install structures along the promenade that emit fine sprays to counter the humidity. These are just some of the many examples that demonstrate that a walkable city is a better city and that the more we walk, the better the city in every respect.

154,Urban cliffs for better city biodiversity,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/urban-cliffs-for-better-city-biodiversity,,"Natural cliffs in the landscape play home to a variety of flora and fauna. By contrast, cities are full of tall vertical structures whose glass and steel exteriors do little to encourage biodiversity. But I believe that if architects approached tall buildings as ‘urban cliffs’ they would be able to design-in a more bio-diverse urban ecosystem. Architects typically view nature, whether plants, animals or insects, as elements to be controlled, directed or resisted by their designs. But by choosing to green their many vertical spaces cities could absorb some of their ambient noise, reduce the Urban Heat Island effect and toxic air, and support a wider variety of plants and animals. Spontaneous colonisation of buildings’ facades does take place, but in an unplanned fashion. Swallows nest under eaves, pigeons occupy windowsills. Vegetated roofs and green walls are effective, but designing an ecosystem is a different skill. Urban cliffs need to be consciously designed and then allowed to establish naturally. In this, architects need to work with specialists such as ecologists to plan the urban cliff habitat effectively. The benefits of green walls and roofs are beginning to be understood in rapidly expanding cities around the world, and in some areas biodiversity is equally valued. Habitat creation for the Black Redstart began the brown roof movement in the UK, and in Singapore the city government co-funds green roofs and walls through the Skyrise Greenery initiative. Biodiversity was designed-in above and below the Vancouver Convention Centre. Its six acre sloping roof is the largest non-industrial green roof in North America, and is proven to reduce heat gains in summer and heat losses from within during the winter. This roof was also designed to mimic the local beachfront seabird nesting habitat that is threatened by development, and supports 240,000 bees. With urban cliff ecosystems the amount of biodiversity can be incorporated to match the clients’ aesthetic and maintenance expectations. Cliff ecosystems vary from sheer walls to cascading plateaus, and these extremes can be easily incorporated in to both existing and new buildings. The sheer walls that characterise our cities for instance, mimic stone cliffs, where the design focus needn’t be extensive planting, but rather the careful incorporation of roosting or nesting sites, which could service nearby parks or extensive green walls and roofs. Creating an urban cliff that responds directly to the local climate means that some planting may be lush during the growth season, dormant during colder / drier months. This direct response to the local climate and growth cycles reduces maintenance requirements and encourages a stronger link and appreciation of prevailing conditions. Focussing on biodiversity and not just plants means that a wide range of complementary habitats can be established, leading to greater overall biodiversity. Urban biodiversity is an often misunderstood or underappreciated dimension of the built environment, yet it underpins almost every other ‘green’ aspect of a city. Generating awareness of the benefits of this approach is an important first step. Do you know of any examples of urban cliffs that have improved the biodiversity of a city, whether planned or accidental?"
155,BIM Champions: why do we need them? ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/bim-champions-why-do-we-need-them,,"Building Information Modelling (BIM) Champion is a buzzword that is increasingly heard amongst the BIM community and my research indicates that this may be because BIM projects do better with a BIM Champion. But who are the BIM Champions and why are they needed? A BIM Champion is the person who has the technical skills, theoretical knowledge and the motivation to lead and guide teams improving their BIM implementation. The levels of BIM Champion's involvement within the BIM utilisation process differs across companies and varies sometimes within the same company across different projects. The UK's BIM Task Group has appointed a number of BIM Champions to support the BIM utilisation across different regions. Many national and international companies have also relied on BIM Champions to drive the cultural BIM change within their businesses and influence the success of the projects. Yet, despite the recognition of the BIM Champion’s role, there is still a lack of a quantifiable and objective way to investigate their impact on the implementation of BIM. To address this gap, Arup has interrogated its in-house BIM Maturity Measure (BIM-MM) which it uses globally to assess project maturity. The primary purpose of the BIM-MM is not to investigate the impact of the BIM Champion – this is just one of the questions that the tool allows us to investigate. The BIM-MM is a tool that evaluates BIM in projects, it combines a set of critical BIM criteria including the BIM Champion. Each of the evaluated criteria has six evolving maturity levels. For instance, for the BIM Champion criteria these levels range from 0. ‘Non-Existent’ – ‘No BIM Champion/Leader’ to 5. ‘Optimising’ – ‘Leadership level BIM Champion working closely with BIM regional champion’. The positive impact of the BIM Champion has been acknowledged by project managers at Arup. Sean McGinn, manager of a project with a high level of BIM maturity, notes: Both the initial set up and the early assistance [of the BIM Champion and manager] proved invaluable to the client to get the project organised the right way from the outset. For such a large and fast-tracked project, this was essential for the success of delivery, and much appreciated by the client.” Arup has a policy of regularly measuring its BIM projects, analysing the results and sharing lessons to its teams. It shared the data of 213 assessed projects with researchers at the University of Bath, UK to support the academics researching the future of construction and to get some independent feedback on the tool. The findings show that the BIM projects do better with a BIM Champion. And it can be seen that the average score of projects with BIM Champion Level 5 ‘Optimising’ is much more significant than the average score of projects with no BIM Champion. Currently, with the lack of studies on evaluating BIM, Professionals are using the BIM-MM as a tool to answer different questions on the BIM agenda. How is BIM being used across project teams and regions? And how to drive change and recognise benefits through BIM performance measurement? These answers will help to diminish the uncertainty surrounding BIM culture and assist academics, policy makers and professionals to better understand what 'good' looks like. In order to help the industry investigate these questions Arup has made the BIM-MM available on Arup.com for anyone to use. Find out more about our BIM expertise"
156,Why we should look at city planning from a child's perspective ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/why-we-should-look-at-city-planning-from-a-child-perspective,,"As our cities densify, diversify and become challenged by affordability and space, they must adapt to meet changing uses and purposes to accommodate business people, singles, men, women, families and more. Placing a child-like lens over our view while planning for cities may seem frivolous for some. We have grown up continuously told to look forward into our future as we forget our past. Yet as our cities grow and change to accommodate more residential and mixed-use developments, it is important to consider the streets and public spaces for our youngest dwellers. Our adult mindset recognises the need for an increase in schools and childcare services within our city lifestyle, but have we considered the desires and requirements of children for their new backyards and activity centres? We recently held a drop-in session for Arup staff in Sydney to tell us what makes a child-friendly city. Unsurprisingly, the key takeaways were access to schools, activities, safe walking paths, pedestrianised streets and a connected public transport network. Playing with lego we asked the kids to create buildings and places of interest. There were three different jails, a plane with a treasure chest, references of war, an office, and interestingly a series of interconnected and colour-coded floating buildings from a young girl who had the opportunity to live in Amsterdam so understood different travel modes. The most intriguing creation involved a power station that was monitored with a chicken leg that turned when full. The children all had beautifully unique and intriguing stories behind their creations. The workshops provided a plethora of ideas to continue with our research. We felt so lucky to interact with the beautiful, open and creative minds in the workshop. We were reminded that cities are no longer centralised business districts for which they were once created; they are people’s backyards, grocery stores, gyms and playgrounds.

When designing our cities, more allowance for open space and space between buildings may be the best way to allow children to explore safely and engage with environments away from the dangers of a city. Cities of today must work with the fabric of their original form, and adapt to meet the requirements of the people who are its inhabitants. 1 of 2 Children playing with Lego in our Sydney office As we move into cities for jobs and convenience or as we pass through them on our holidays, and as we bring our children into these places, we are increasingly aware that these dense, urban environments require adaptation to be safe and friendly for both adults and children alike. Our final workshop session will ask a select group of kids more targeted questions about their ideal city.

157,Planning cities for migration,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/planning-cities-for-migration,,"Migration is a natural human phenomenon, but not one that organisations in the built environment are that focused on. City planners can anticipate the radical societal change generated by migration, in order to help cities, their populations and industries to prepare. Migration is increasing Research from the World Bank’s Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) initiative has identified that one out of every seven people in the world is a migrant. Understandably cities have always been priority destinations for migrants, offering opportunity and the chance for a new start. Emerging factors like the global loss of habitat caused by climate change are also spurring ever greater migration around the world, increasing the need for provisional accommodation. In 2015, over a million people applied for asylum in the EU, being displaced persons, escaping from conflicts in their countries or just looking for better living conditions. The arrival of a large number of refugees has created significant challenges to urban governance, planning and urban design in many European cities as a result. Questions for cities have arisen, such as how to assist, house, train and integrate individuals from different cultures. City migration solutions Since the ‘refugee crisis’ started in Europe, many cities have shown exemplary abilities to find local solutions and an ability to adapt to the needs of a changing population. As Mayor Ada Colau stated in 2015 while launching the Barcelona, Refuge City action plan, ‘it may be that states grant asylum, but it is cities that provide shelter’. In Leipzig, Germany, groups are providing communal apartments for small numbers of people, and social workers are coordinating volunteers to support refugees’ integration. In Berlin modular housing initiatives are being developed, creating container villages to house refugees. The ‘Kinetic City As architect and professor Rahul Mehrotra advocates, humanity is already creating in many places of the world what he calls the Kinetic City, or temporary informal settlements where ‘nothing is forever and nothing is sacred’. For example, every 12 years, around seven million pilgrims gather in Haridwar, India, to create a temporary settlement while taking part in the two month long Hindu festival, Kumbh Mela. As Mehrotra says, this reality shows the ‘changing roles for people and spaces in our urban society’, so our cities must be able to ‘expand and contract’ accordingly. It’s vital that urban practitioners and professionals draw on existing best practice and discuss how to support cities as they face the challenges of a moving population – for instance understanding the needs of a temporary population, as suggested by the German Pavillon at the last Venice Biennale among others. By working closely with public and private sectors, planners can understand migration, discuss possible frameworks of action, and commit to creating more sustainable, equitable and balanced cities. What other ways are urban planners designing better responses to migration? Do share them in the comments below."
158,Machine learning graduates from Facebook to the built environment,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/machine-learning-graduates-from-facebook-to-the-built-environment,,"Machine learning applications are already ubiquitous in our everyday life. When you log into Facebook and someone has tagged you in a photo that is a prime example of the roots of machine learning, which reside in image and facial recognition. Not only does it recognise that it is your face, but also that you have a human face based on the features and relationship between your pixels and all other pixels in the image. When you speak to Siri on an iPhone, it ‘hears’ your words using speech recognition. When you use Google Translate the sequence of words you used is likely being translated now by something called a recurrent neural network. When you open your email (mostly) free of unwanted messages, you can thank machine learning for the spam filter –  which is likely powered by a technique which has classified junk from non-junk based on the nuanced features of many millions of spam-classified emails. When online shopping, or browsing Netflix, recommendations are given to us on what we are likely to watch from an algorithm of people who are likely similar to us, and have made similar choices to us. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning are also coming to our attention ever-increasingly in industry – particularly for me in transport in relation to the rapid development of the systems that will support the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles While AI encompasses the broader goal of computers that can learn and act, machine learning is much more specific sub-set of AI which can be used for solving well-defined problems. Deep learning is a further extension of machine learning, which expands the concept of neural networks (which are inspired by the functionality of the human brain). Unlike usual algorithms used to perform specific tasks, machine learning methods are employed to learn how to perform a specific task – learning as more data is provided. Just as we have different learning styles, there are (quite a few) different ways which a machine can learn. These methods can be categorised into either supervised learning (where the algorithms have a training dataset to learn from) or unsupervised learning (where we are interested more in discovering underlying patterns and structure in data). As our computing processing power increases, storage becomes cheaper and data sources richer there is an increasing demand to the develop methods and skills to solve problems with machine learning in many domains – which is potentially any that involves data and identifying patterns. “ So away from use cases that we can mainly find on our mobile phones and the internet what are some potential applications in the physical, built environment? ” Oliver Lock Planner Intelligent transportation One of the main draws for me to the transport field is the sheer amount of data that is being generated by the movements of people and vehicles , and how important these movements are to such a wide variety of groups – from retailers, to delivery companies, to public transport operators, to property developers, advertisers, employers, planners, economists and toll road operators. Data such as the soon-to-be released Uber Movement, Strava, GTFS Real-time and even Geolocated tweets are both contesting and complementing our traditionally-used methods. As these technologies are continuously collected they have an advantage over traditional travel data collection methods, which are generally cross-sectional in nature and generally, due to costs, sampled at a much less frequent rate. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. With more data, we are much better able to infer behaviour before and after a specific event (such as disaster or disruption), as well as over a long-period of time from continuous data coverage. As machine learning is a data-hungry discipline, this places many transportation data related tasks well to be optimised. Energy and utilities The optimal, sustainable use of our energy systems both at the supply-side and the user-side is critical to sustainable future. Being able to better predict accurate energy consumption forecasts can help implement better energy-saving policies in cities. A number of machine learning applications could benefit further investigation in this sector. For example: Optimising consumer energy use The Nest Thermostat uses machine learning to learn a homeowner’s preferences and schedules to optimise heating and cooling. Creating a smart energy grid The energy sector in Germany has employed machine learning to optimise the power grid and manage the maximisation of renewable versus non-renewable energy. Environment and waste management Automated waste collection and tailored collection services Several years ago, Volvo announced that it was developing robots to replace the physically-demanding, sometimes dangerous task of garbage collection with a more automated, robotic system. To add to this, machine learning could track and predict waste levels in a city’s bins and manage demand (and charge users) accordingly. Architecture and urban design Informing design through crowd-sourced perception of place MIT Media lab have collated a large set of data on people’s perceptions of safety to feed a machine-learning algorithm which determines how safe a street may look to the human eye. This kind of research could alter the way we design spaces to suit the potential emotional goals or needs of a space, and help us understand which features we ought to include or exclude from design.

159,Habitat for Humanity and volunteering abroad ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/habitat-for-humanity-and-volunteering-abroad,,"Arup has a strong relationship with Habitat for Humanity. Several times a year, through its community engagement programme, Arup sponsors a few staff members to participate in Habitat’s Global Village program where participants help build a new home for somebody in need. In a few short weeks, 6 Arup staff members will head to Battambang, Cambodia to participate in the program. This will be an exciting time for all involved, including the volunteers, recipient family, builders and wider community. It is also an opportune moment to reflect on the benefit of the Global Village Program and understand why not all international volunteering programs are equal. Last September, I was lucky to be selected to travel to Kenya with Habitat for Humanity to participate in the program, alongside 5 Arup staff members and 10 other volunteers. Over the course of the week, we assisted local Kenyan builders to build a new home for Mary Ojouk and her grandchildren, who had until then all lived in a single room mud brick hut with a rusty corrugated iron roof and no running water. I appreciated the work that Habitat did from the very beginning. We were reminded that this was, first and foremost, a cultural exchange, and that the house would have been built with or without us (but with kind donations from participants, of course). Our assistance ended up proving very beneficial to the builders, who were paid in a lump sum and were therefore very happy have more helping hands to get the job done more quickly. However, upon reflection, it was indeed this cultural exchange that I valued most as it had the biggest impact on both my personal and professional development. Habitat stands out for me for the experience they provide to volunteers, their employment of local staff, builders, their use of local materials and adherence to traditional building design in order to have a targeted impact on community members. What about other volunteering providers? Volunteering abroad can have many benefits to you and the community. However, not all volunteering providers are the same. Certain factors should be considered before deciding to go. Fresh out of high school I had had a very different experience volunteering at a primary school in Kenya. It was then that I learned the danger of voluntourism and the damage this may cause to a local community. “ I had no hard skills to offer, did not speak any of the native languages and had no appreciation of the school curriculum. Was this really the best contribution I could make? ” Julia Gluchowska While volunteering abroad can be a meaningful experience, it is important to research the program before participating. Here are some take-aways from my experience: What skills do you have to offer? As a ‘teacher’, I soon realised that I, and many other volunteers, were in the same position- we had no hard skills to offer and often felt like we were drawing away potential income from skilled local teachers. If you have fundraised money, who can you speak to about the best use of the money? The school I volunteered at had had many volunteers come through its doors. The school had no electricity, no glass windows, outhouses for toilets and dirt floors. A group of well-meaning volunteers had used money they had raised to build a fence around the school. Except they ran out of money after building the gate and so the project was abandoned immediately. Local residents will always know what is best, so it is best to engage in discussion with them to determine what is most needed and wanted in their community. If volunteering at an orphanage: • What is the true objective of the orphanage? Since the rise of voluntourism, many orphanages have been found to exist solely for the financial benefit of the founder. • How will the strong but short-lived relationship you built with a child, impact the child in the long term? Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Building a relationship with a child can be rewarding for you both, however consider the impact that your stay may have. How many other volunteers have bonded with the child, and then left after a short period, without any further contact? Will this impact the child’s ability to trust and build lasting relationships? What would be the best way to leave a lasting positive impact on the children you meet? In general: Is the organisation you want to volunteer with local? Do they employ local people and consider local customs?"
160,Why culture should drive city planning,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/why-culture-should-drive-city-planning,,"In my view, while infrastructure and services are necessary for environmental health, it is culture that provides identity, belonging and expression and support, and consequently the foundations for happier, healthier, more cohesive communities. And a thriving cultural scene encourages further private investment too. In other words, I believe that ‘culture infrastructure’ should occupy as central a role in urban planning as more conventionally accepted components like transport. In the last ten years there has been a growing body of evidence that cultural involvement can have significant positive effect on public health and community stability. Varied and accessible local engagement in culture can create a desire to be a part of (rather than leave) a neighbourhood, building overall social resilience Communities gain in a variety of tangible ways, from savings in primary healthcare and lower crime and policing costs to increased private sector support and investment providing regeneration of inner city areas. With the benefits bolstered by research, culture could begin to stand alongside traditional investment recipients like new infrastructure, services, housing and others. Earlier this year, the UK’s Department of Culture Media and Sport’s 2016 Culture White Paper firmly recognised the social value of culture. Following this, Unesco’s Global Report on Culture for Sustainable Urban Development goes further, identifying culture as intrinsic to people. In their words ’sustainable cities need integrated policy-making that builds on culture‘. In poorer cities the need for justification becomes more critical. And international bodies like the World Cities Culture Forum are attempting to provide guidance to cities as they try to take advantage of cultural projects to improve social cohesion. Prior to the 2016 Rio Olympics in Brazil, the population of the city’s poor living in favelas expressed strong concerns about how much money was being spent, and what they might have to forego as a result. Cultural policy was notionally crafted to address wider social and economic tensions, in particular through the reuse of venues and construction materials used to house the games. And after the 2012 Olympics in London, a well-planned post-Games legacy phase proved that the money spent in preparation could create a vibrant new community, with housing and parkland for local people on the Olympic park site. Identifying the potential of cultural investment is ‘all-well-and-good’ but funding cultural investment is an altogether different matter. It is for politicians, developers and communities to decide where to invest to achieve greatest social benefits, but measuring ‘cultural contribution’ in purely fiscal terms is difficult because many of its significant financial benefits are indirect. Quantifying return-on-investment requires more complex models and higher levels of assumption than more conventional infrastructure projects. As a result, culture risks continuing to be perceived as a consequence rather than a driver of a city’s health and vitality. In order to gain acceptance we need a more appropriate and convincing way to rate a project’s value beyond the merely financial aspects. While value measurement systems may take time to mature, it is our responsibility to take action now. As designers we are encouraged to think sustainably, but we must think more broadly. Our aim should not just be to create sustainable buildings but to develop truly sustainable communities. Our designs should have cultural and social value at their heart, and in so doing, we can truly shape a better world."
161,Rewilding cities for resilience ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/rewilding-cities-for-resilience,,"Since the dawn of civilisation, settlements and their growth have directly related to the natural world and its resources. Furthermore designing with nature has been well documented since the work of Ian McHarg and Nan Fairbrother amongst others. Despite this most cities are currently disconnected from the natural world. I think by integrating the restoration of ecosystem functions or ‘rewilding’ within an urban context there is an opportunity to reverse the destruction of the natural world and reconnect people with the wonder of nature. To reduce the pressures of increasing urbanisation, designers, planners and environmentalists should embrace the concept of rewilding our cities. Rewilding, a word coined by conservationist Dave Foreman in 1990 can play an important role in green infrastructure and shaping resilient cities. It can generate opportunities for our damaged ecosystems to regenerate, returning to natural systems and processes which can help combat many issues we are currently facing including climate change, increased risk of flooding, poor air quality and pollution. Rewilding as an ecological strategy is gaining publicity and political awareness. Initiatives such as Wild Ennerdale provide fantastic examples of the positive work partnerships can achieve working towards Rewilding Britain. However, as it is most easily conceived on a large rural landscape scale, a lot still needs to be done to embed the philosophy as the way forward for cities and to prevent people feeling disconnected with it as a movement. Restoring natural processes would make our cities more resilient, improving the population’s health, happiness, create natural play and learning opportunities, improve community spirit and boost local economies. Nature can be the cornerstone of healthy, sustainable communities and also improve the quality of life and quality of space. We have the potential to re-imagine city spaces and challenge preconceived assumptions, which often lead to urban landscapes which are predictable, heavily maintained, often privatised and one dimensional. Rewilding could create dynamic, ecologically rich urban landscapes with a sense of time and seasonal change, reduced management costs and increased social equality. Reconnecting people with nature is a self-sustaining process as they become more educated, and develop a stronger connection and a sense of stewardship to the natural world around them. The rewilding of cities can be carried out at a range of scales and to a range of completeness. There are a growing number of contemporary precedents, including Arup’s work on the Wild West End with the largest of London’s West End property owners to demonstrate the positive impact of urban green infrastructure. And the London Wildlife Trust’s ‘Living Landscapes’ plan provides precedents such as the River Wandle, which is an exciting example of an urban rewilding project which restores a heavily polluted river to an ecologically thriving chalk stream. And international design practices such as Turenscape are creating inspirational projects, including Qunli National Urban Wetland and the restoration of the Sanlihe Corridor. These examples illustrate the multifunctional benefits of rewilding our cities, and the potential it has for being the catalyst for environmental and socio-economic improvements. Rewilding can only succeed if it is considered as a dynamic process of restoring ecosystem functionality rather than an outcome of creating a wilderness. It has the potential to rejuvenate ecosystems’ functionality, to create greater connections between people and the natural world, and to breathe new life into our cities. How can we encourage clients to embrace rewilding as an inspirational approach for our cities?"

C40 cities collectively represent 650 million people, and make up a quarter of global GDP. The report’s goal is to present a detailed pathway of the C40 cities’ roles in bringing the Paris Agreement’s targets to fruition – helping to keep global temperatures below a 1.5°C rise since pre-industrial levels. Arup produced the Deadline 2020 report in partnership with C40, which describes the five key areas for cities to reduce their carbon emissions, referred to as the ‘five pathways’. While cities are central to this report, it also highlights the essential role of both private industry and national governments in helping cities deliver meaningful actions. Our report illustrates how these groups can work together to implement the changes needed and how, with the right communication, they can greatly benefit each other and the world. Arup has extensive experience working with both city administrations and private sector businesses and is in a unique position to help the two groups collaborate to create a sustainable legacy for generations to come. Explore how both cities and private sector can complement each other in achieving the targets set out in Paris: Future of cities Future of cities Eleven years since the C40 group was established, it has grown to over 80 members, and are already working to reduce their collective carbon emissions by a total of more than 3 gigatonnes by 2030.

The resulting task at hand is one which requires a great amount of work to realise, yet one which has already seen great achievements. So far some 11,000 actions have been taken by C40 cities to begin reducing carbon emissions, which shows a promising drive towards the agreed commitments. The next four years are crucial to maintain and build on this momentum and will, if actioned correctly, result in a much-improved likelihood of aligning with globally-agreed targets at the national level. This is an exciting time for cities to work alongside private businesses and use ground-breaking technology to achieve their 2020 and subsequently 2050 emissions targets. Publications Deadline 2020: How cities will get the job done CoP21 in Paris committed signatories to “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.” What does this mean for Cities? Download We can help you design and implement the technology you need Arup produced the Deadline 2020 report, in partnership with C40 and, as a result, gained deep insight into the challenges faced by cities to achieve their emissions targets. The pathways proposed by Arup will detail exactly which actions need to be taken by whom and when; many of these will require new, or different, collaborations with the private sector. The actions which have already been taken by cities have chiefly been ones over which they have a large amount of control, sometimes with little private sector aid. Now to build on that good work, effective collaboration needs to happen between businesses and cities, and new relationships must be brokered. Private businesses need to understand what challenges cities are facing in order for them to innovate and offer the right solutions for cities to hit their targets. “ Integrated energy planning is necessary for a low carbon urban future. Innovative solutions using renewable technologies, such as microgrids, together with city action networks and new funding mechanisms will make the difference. It is these big technological and political shifts that are giving cities the opportunity to take control. ” Alan Thomson Global Energy Leader With our reach, our depth of knowledge and our standout collaborative approach, Arup is uniquely positioned to broker vital relationships between cities, local and national governments along with the private sector. By combining our experience of what works with local understanding of the issues, we create the opportunities for both private sector collaboration and implementation of the proposed solutions. We can help you unlock available funding and finance Financing is a key challenge for cities investing in new, greener technologies and infrastructure. However, the potential cost of inaction has been projected to far outweigh the initial investment costs. Globally, programmes are now in place to improve cities' access to funding and finance. For example, the C40 Cities Finance Facility (CFF) alone will provide $20m of support by 2020 to help cities access up to $1.24bn of additional capital. In addition to bilateral and multilateral funds such as the CFF, cities need to utilise increasingly innovative methods to fund and finance low-carbon interventions in the built environment. Only through creative funding and financing initiatives such as infrastructure value capture can we ensure that the public and private sector share both the value, and the cost of investing in a low-carbon future. Only through creative funding and financing initiatives such as infrastructure value capture can we ensure that the public and private sector share both the value, and the cost of investing in a low-carbon future. “ We need to bring in citizens and the private sector. We must reach the leaders of global finance, to join us in bringing about the energetic and ecological shift towards a climate safe world. ” Anne Hidalgo C40 Chair and Mayor of Paris ""Green, low carbon, low emissions solutions are no longer the risk they were once considered. The technology is commercially ready. The cost is competitive. We need to place these innovations at the heart of urban transport; cities collaborating with the private sector to support faster delivery mechanisms that will accelerate application.” Isabel Dedring Global Transport Leader, Arup The prime city engineers For cities to make meaningful changes in infrastructure, cities need to understand the full scope of who benefits, how value is created, how it is to be designed, how it is to be funded, financed and finally, how it is to be constructed.

There is a huge opportunity, and necessity, for the private sector to position themselves now as partners in helping cities achieve their goals. In fact, cities alone are only accountable for achieving around 50% of their targets – the private sector is essential in enabling them to achieve the final 50%. Globally, there is now funding and finance available for low-carbon and climate resilient investment through funds created to help cities reach their targets.

Arup’s conception of the ‘five pathways’ has given us a deep understanding of the meaningful action that needs to be taken by the C40 cities across the Buildings, Energy, Transit, Urban Planning and Waste sectors, and therefore the size of the opportunities for the private sector. By integrating our advisory services with our key strengths in design, engineering, and implementation, we understand the nature of what needs to be done when, and who is involved in making sure these things get done – for citizens, cities, and investors. We will help you identify the right solutions for cities One of the key challenges faced by the private sector when looking to work with or pitching to city administrators, is getting a solid understanding of the challenge, the desired outcomes and how to achieve them. Arup has a successful history partnering with both and can facilitate effective collaboration between them, helping to understand what is needed and what is being offered. This mutual collaboration can enable your business to become the go-to provider or partner of cities in their efforts to address climate change.

165,"Women and engineering, is flexibility the key?",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/women-and-engineering-is-flexibility-the-key,,"What are the enablers and barriers to attract and retain women in our industry? How can we accelerate change? What do we need to put in place to arrest the steady decline of women as they approach middle management? These are some of the questions I posed to senior women in our industry at the Consult Australia Champions of Change (CACC) boardroom lunch recently. I had the pleasure of hosting the inaugural lunch in Sydney. As business leaders or ‘champions’ of change, we have made a commitment to disrupt the norm and make material change to the unacceptably low levels of women in leadership in Australia’s consulting industry. My fellow champions, who include Matthew Harris (Rider Levett Bucknall), William Cox (Aurecon), Andrew Mather (WSP Group) and myself at Arup, have all introduced various programmes and initiatives within our respective firms to ensure gender balance. But are they enough? We wanted to hear from women who had been successful about the programmes and initiatives that they’d found beneficial and, more importantly, what was needed to achieve significant change. “ Flexibility was a key theme. Flexible jobs, careers, leave options and environments. It was a clear message and an issue that needs to be addressed not just for women, but for everyone. ” Peter Bailey Principal and Trustee Director I was reminded of a nugget in Sheryl Sandberg’s book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead that really resonated with me: it’s better to think in terms of a career jungle gym than a career ladder. Why does this resonate? Because our careers don’t take a straight line trajectory. There are many and varied reasons why careers can take twists and turns we often don’t foresee. Child birth and rearing, assignments, a new job, promotions, illness, caring for aging parents or grandchildren, sabbaticals, redundancy or the desire to take a backwards step, can all affect our careers. Women or men. For all these reasons, and more, flexibility in career, and flexible working, are essential. The need to be able to work flexibly – whether that’s part time, altered start and end times, working from home, leave of absence or purchasing additional leave, is not just an issue for women returning to the workforce after childbirth, but rather a human issue that affects all of us at some stage in our careers. “ And if more men were to work flexibly, surely this would free up work options for their partners? ” Peter Bailey Principal and Trustee Director I often work flexibly when I need to balance my responsibilities as a parent with work and, in our recent Who works at Arup survey? 19% of our staff have flexible working arrangements in place and 30% say they are considering working flexibly in the future. The benefits to organisations of a diverse and inclusive workforce (improved business performance) and flexible working (reduced stress, staff have less distractions, smaller office spaces reduce overheads, higher morale and reduced sick leave) are well documented. Workplace flexibility is also linked to the wellness and improved health outcomes for staff. Clearly, flexibility isn’t the only answer. Equal earning power. Equality in childcare and domestic responsibilities. Education around gender bias. These can all, and should all, be championed and accounted for within the workplace.

Now, and certainly for the next generation of new talent who expect much more from employers. It’appraiss essential to our success, as well as theirs. It’s also heartening to see that world business and political leaders are taking flexibility and wellness seriously.

167,Habitat III calls for sustainability for all ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/habitat-iii-calls-for-sustainability-for-all,,"Since its original Habitat I declaration, signed in 1976, the United Nations has recognised the effects of an urbanising world and the urgent need for sustainable urban development. October 2016 marks its third incarnation, Habitat III. For 40 years, these landmark documents have defined the challenges urban populations face from uncontrolled urbanisation, climate change and unequally shared economic prosperity. Since 1996’s Habitat II, the aim has been to stop the deterioration of urban settlements and enable the most vulnerable to thrive. In recent decades urbanisation has increased rapidly, making the problems cities face more urgent and harder to solve. Habitat III’s task-based focus is therefore timely. Habitat III’s New Urban Agenda (NUA) is an action-orientated urban sustainability approach, and suggests a way to achieve previously unmet goals and overcome new and future challenges. The document as it stands is wordy and perhaps unwieldy, and organisations will have to respond critically where they perceive gaps in its analysis. But what is clear, is that this new declaration will require nations, international development organisations and their private sector partners to readdress the way that cities plan, finance, develop, govern and manage their operations. Multi-national organisations, governments, donor agencies and businesses will use this agenda to shape their programmes and policies, which will translate into private sector commissions, including planning, engineering and construction. It’s vital that private sector organisations now bring the experience and knowledge gained on large masterplanning and infrastructure projects to help cities make better long-term development decisions. The private sector’s strength as a neutral player lies in bringing together traditionally disparate stakeholders. They can form new partnerships between civil society groups, local and national governments, and international organisations as they identify, finance and monitor sustainable development. But private sector organisations will also need to expand their own sustainability capabilities, for example gaining experience in developing country contexts and working with decentralised finance instruments. The NUA also seeks to revive spatial planning, an idea that has lost support in recent decades, placing a renewed emphasis on environmental management and responses to population growth and demographic change. The private sector will also have to evolve a response to the NUA’s demand that future development actions meet the needs of equality. From now on, ‘sustainable’ must mean sustainable for all. Making urban development sustainable also means equipping cities to deal with numerous systemic and local risks, from infrastructure deficits to unforeseen crises, from climate change to pandemics. Arup has developed the City Resilience Index (CRI), with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, to make establishing resilience more tangible and practical for cities and organisations across the world. It is based on three years of rigorous research, drawn from 30 diverse cities, and has widely created a common language and platform for the discourse around resilience. The time for action has arrived. For private sector organisations Habitat III’s New Urban Agenda marks the moment to evolve, enhance and deepen their engagement with the sustainable urban development of cities."
168,Our energy future: 2016 Zunz Lecture,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-recap-of-the-zunz-lecture-2016,,"The 2016 UTS Zunz Lecture considered our electric future with Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel AO. The Zunz Lecture Series, established in 2001, explores broad community issues relating to engineering and information technology. This year, Dr Finkel considered Australia's energy future, discussing potential sources, technologies, and shifting drivers of demand alongside an expert panel. Speaking on the day of the announcement of the closure of Victoria’s Hazelwood brown coal power station, of the NSW government’s goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and the day before the Paris Agreement came into force, Chief Scientist Alan Finkel’s Zunz lecture addressing Australia’s electricity future couldn’t have been more topical. Dr Finkel acknowledged current discourse around energy generation – and his own recent appointment to the Federal government’s energy security review following the September blackout that shut down South Australia – in a public lecture which looked back, and forward, to the development and distribution of electricity for Australian towns and cities Undoubtedly coal has made a major contribution to Australia's economic development, but at what cost? With increasing commitments locally and globally to replace older technologies with renewables and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the challenge now for governments and the energy industry is to transition to more viable solutions. First and foremost, electricity supply needs to be secure, and reliable and affordable, and it needs to lower our emissions over time. – Dr Alan Finkel Dr Barr agreed that three elements are vital, but believes that, while any two of the three are currently achievable, greater and cheaper storage capacity is required to attain all three together. Nicola Ison identified four key drivers for transitioning to alternate energy sources: the Paris Agreement, Australia’s ageing infrastructure, the enormous downward transformation in the cost of renewables and the role of the consumers wanting real value from their energy producers. The complexity of evolving consumer behaviour, and demand for choice, is a significant factor in the way industry – retailers and generators – will need to operate. “ We now have more diverse consumer base, it has more diverse energy needs, is more engaged and requires more consultation – the old assumptions that any two neighbouring houses had the same profile use just can’t be made anyone more. – John Pierce ” With changes in consumption, systems need to be both productive and efficient. Think of the expanding range of devices you might want as a consumer – amongst them electric vehicles and home battery packs. And think of the new ways in which you might want to engage with the grid, like selling the excess electricity from your solar panels directly to your neighbours, peer to peer. Australians’ uptake of rooftop solar segued into the prospects of energy storage capacity, which also addressed some of the very pointed questions around intermittency raised following the South Australian blackout. Ison said modeling already exists which shows how to take Australia to 100% renewable energy – energy for transport, for industrial processes. This includes solar and wind energy, acknowledged as variable, but predictable, sources. “ We need to move away from a 20th century base load power paradigm and this is a challenge that young engineers really want to tackle. – Nicola Ison ” Energy storage is a big opportunity for Australian innovation. First, because it is one way we can deal with the problem of intermittency whilst harnessing renewable energy across the grid; and second, because it is a field in which we are starting to play particularly well. With goodwill and time on our side, electricity generation can be decarbonised. Whether it’s hydroelectric dams, or solar and wind, there are many viable technology paths to cutting emissions. There are challenges in bringing them online, but over time, the solutions will come – just as we have learned to harness new technologies before. Our electricity generation mix is changing, and will continue to change. Ultimately, it is the market and the science that will decide. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

169,Making affordable housing schemes more viable ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/making-affordable-housing-schemes-more-viable,,"A long-term lack of house building, and a particular shortfall in the availability of affordable homes, is having a detrimental effect on UK society. Only if we improve the commercial viability of brownfield sites will house building increase. To achieve this I believe schemes must include the wider ancillary benefits of development in viability assessments and business case justifications. As housing charity Shelter has claimed, the current situation often leaves families struggling with the insecurity of private rents on short-term contracts, and children whose education is often interrupted by constant changes of address. The UK Government has made some efforts to tackle the shortfall in house building. The 2016 Housing and Planning Act implements a number of reforms to ease the path from potential site to completed housing development. But basic economics dictates that affordability issues will only start to ease as the availability of suitable, affordable properties increases. How then should land be made more viable for housing development? Although there has been an increase in the amount of land freed up from within the UK’s green belts, it is a contentious issue and brownfield sites, including government-owned sites, create opportunities for more house building. Due to the need for land remediation, ecological mitigation and improvements to transport connectivity, utilities and public realm, many land parcels in long-term, inactive public ownership are deemed “difficult” and therefore fail on commercial viability. But by looking at the wider potential value of a site, the housing aspect’s fortunes can improve. For example, a housing development on a currently fenced-off, contaminated parcel of former railway sidings may not break even. However, if it was effectively integrated with neighbouring areas when built-out it will provide improved connectivity for the wider community in addition to new homes – a double win. Although the wider ‘societal’ benefits can often be monetised, this commercial gain doesn’t always generally accrue to the developer and is therefore unlikely to encourage their investment. This is often a double loss, as ‘difficult sites’ are often located in areas that desperately need built environment investment to overcome years of decay and related socio-economic problems. So another way to boost a development’s chances is to help developers recognise that better connectivity and modest place-making within the scheme can increase the property’s overall commercial value. There are also moves afoot in Government to move toward direct investment and construction of homes on publically owned sites. There are clear advantages linked to this approach, including the potential to reinvest money usually ring-fenced for profit in market led developments to improve the quality of homes, whilst maintaining levels of affordability. Finally, we shouldn’t forget the key role played by housing associations, particularly those that embrace innovative approaches to land development. In their dual role as house builder and landlord they arguably have greater insight into a project’s wider benefits for residents, developers and the surrounding community."
170,Building communities one pro bono project at a time ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/building-communities-one-pro-bono-at-a-time,,"Engineers have a responsibility to improve the lives of people and the environment that surrounds us. We are in a unique position whereby we can nurture and build relationships with communities across the world. The role of engineering has to be to drive positive change through meeting the ever evolving infrastructure needs of our cities and regional communities. In many parts of the world, communities face increasing challenges each and every day in the face of rapid urbanisation and climate change. At Arup we feel a responsibility to support these communities, to help them become more self-reliant and resilient, and not suffer in isolation. “ Pro bono work positively impacts our world now and into the future. Through skilled volunteering within communities across the world, engineers undertake a whole range of activities with common goals in mind – improving lives, making the world a better place to live and leaving a lasting legacy. ” Peter Bowtell Australasia Building Design Leader Working closely with Engineers Without Borders to support projects including the Biodigester work in Cambodia; RedR Australia post Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu to assess immediate needs post disaster and in an ongoing capacity through a vital Waste Management improvement project that continues today; Assisting to re-build a community at Narbethong post Black Saturday bush fires through the Narbethong Community Hall project; and ongoing work with the Yea community through volunteering with Habitat for Humanity’s brush with kindness programme.

There are so many ways our engineers at Arup have been able to give back to communities across the world, through our strong program of pro bono and local community engagement work. A seven-time recipient of the ACCSR (Australian Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility) honour of ‘Top 10 organisations with the strongest CSR management capabilities’, Arup is proud of our hundreds of staff who have participated in build programs around the world, and experienced first-hand what it is like to give back to the community. These experiences not only benefit the local communities themselves, but they also change the way our people think about their work and provide long term benefits in relation to the people our Firm attracts and retains. A meaningful place to work Our community engagement program is a very strong motivator to the current generation of new workers and we are seeing every single one of our Graduate program staff members wanting to be involved. This is reflective of a change in broader society, many people nowadays want more from their work life than just making a living out of it. They want to know that what they do contributes to strong social outcomes, and that their work is meaningful. Arup, which was listed in Fortune Magazine’s ‘change the world’ list, conceived its motto of ‘We shape a better world’ over 20 years ago. For two decades, Arup and its people have continually questioned its meaning as a firm and our intentions in these communities and the broader world at large. It could be the ‘Ove Arup’ in us all, or it could just be because we care, but as a firm we continually ask ‘why do we want to be involved in this kind of work?’, ‘what are we motivated by?’ and ‘why do we exist?’.

For two decades, through doing rather than donating (participating rather than philanthropy), we have shown the world the positive impact we can have at the same time as being a profitable commercial enterprise. We have also shown the world that organisations can be driven and motivated by more than just profit. By ensuring pro bono is part of our corporate offering and conversation, it brings an internal check and balance around what is actually driving our organisations’ behaviour. We have shown that pro bono work cannot just be a tick box, or lip service. It’s something that needs to be lived through the organisation and measured appropriately. People are very good at holding leaders to account and recognising when rhetoric is not backed up by action. Any organisation engaging in pro bono work must make sure they are true to what they are espousing. People expect transparency from their employer and with social media providing the ability for staff to comment on their company’s behaviour, you cannot protect your brand and reputation because it is ultimately in the hands of others. If an organisation doesn’t think it can be held accountable by its community, then it will act in a way that is at its own peril. The allegations we are observing around the engineering profession gives us cause to reflect and from an ethical point of view there are clear lines, there are no shades of grey around issues of corruption and we should always be making decisions based on the fact that if behaviours are not ethical, then you just don’t do them. Pro bono work plays a big role here Bribery and corruption have caused great detriment to some of the world’s poorest and vulnerable communities and it has recently been affirmed that this is an issue for our entire profession. A real step change is needed to stamp these practices out and while tougher laws may be part of the solution, pro bono work also has a fundamental role to play. We are lucky to operate in the communities that we do. We are often working off the public purse and where there is a commitment to give back to the community, there is also a responsibility to do the right thing by these communities and help them to create a lasting legacy.

171,Automated vehicles will redefine urban space ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/automated-vehicles-will-redefine-urban-space,,"Roads largely define the shape and operation of cities. That’s why the gathering shift towards automated vehicles road (AVs) is likely to drive significant changes in the design of cities and improve the nature and quality of pedestrian space. I believe that as urban place makers, designers have a vital role to play influencing the shape of the new ‘shared mobility corridors’ that will replace traditional roads. In this ‘shared mobility corridor’ model, different modes of transport, vehicular and non-vehicular (walking, cycling, skate boarding, etc.) are brought closer together to share a common route without the need for separation in levels and design. For Middle Eastern cities, many of which developed in tandem with the twentieth century’s embrace of the motorcar, this new development offers a lot of potentially positive outcomes. For in the move to automated vehicles every aspect of road infrastructure is open to change or reconsideration. AVs, being smaller and lighter vehicles, could potentially run on different surfaces and asphalt might not even be required. The lower speed of AVs and their precision awareness of pedestrians means closer proximity between the vehicles, pedestrians and other road transport is possible. Urban grids can therefore be narrower, allowing for more intimate spaces, shaded through the proximity of adjoining buildings. And parking provision can be optimised, freeing up valuable urban space for other, more social uses. Another design implication relates to the lower emissions of AVs. Unlike combustion engines, electrical engines emit about 19.8% less heat, according to research from Michigan State University. This could dramatically reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE) within cities, which in turn can reduce the need for air conditioning inside the vehicles and the CO2 emissions accompanying it, again reducing the overall heat produced. A reduction in the UHIE also means a more pleasant environment for pedestrians and cyclists, with safer, narrower streets promoting urban walkability. In the Middle East, cities’ contemporary shape is mostly determined by the layout of the road network. With a shift to AVs, design standards such as road widths, turning radii, curb stones, and choice of materials could be completely re-thought in the light of AVs’ vastly different road use profile. This could create a shift towards roads that are more pedestrian-friendly. The era of letting city design be dominated by the needs of the petrol car might be coming to an end. Fundamentally, the coming AV revolution offers designers the chance to reconsider urban design as an opportunity to cater for people, both inside and outside of their vehicles. How would you re-design our city roads given the coming AV revolution?"
172,"Digital masterplanning: connecting people, places and spaces ",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/digital-masterplanning-connecting-people-places-and-spaces,,"‘Digital native’ is a phrase we hear a lot. It refers to a generation ‘born digital’ – those who have grown up with their lives so fully integrated with digital technologies, that they can’t imagine life any other way. But they aren’t the only ones so digitally immersed - all generations have taken to digital technologies at an impressive rate. Here in Australia, we are recognised as early adopters. We have long expected to be connected anytime, anywhere, bringing new ways of thinking about collaboration and ‘distance’, both at home and at work. Digital advancement is increasingly influencing the way we think about our interaction with people, place and technology. It is also influencing how we design our built environments. Think of the cityscape as we know it today – now overlay that with interconnected data that allows us to personalise how we interact with our cities and other users in ways that could enhance our enjoyment, health, and productivity. Data, data, data The quality of the built environment is only one piece of the puzzle. Invisible elements like data enabled connectivity, are helping to create unique environments and user experiences that can enhance our cities and buildings. These data are the building blocks on which people can develop the digital tools that allow us to tailor our environments, and interactions, depending on our preference and need. This could mean anything from adjusting your overhead lighting and air-conditioning using your phone, to pre-ordering lunch from your favourite place in the food court. Then reserving a space for you and friends at work to actually eat together rather than everyone queuing at different places then heading back to the office when you can’t find somewhere to sit together. Access to more information puts control in the individual’s hands. Gathering and presenting data that offers this to people has led to a proliferation of apps and services. The collection, aggregation, and analysis of data is the crucial lynchpin. It is driving improvements in customer experience and helping us to get the most out of our infrastructure and built environment. The driver for all this is the availability of data Masterplanning for the cloud Before you get the data though you need to build the network that collects them. The first stage in developing a digital masterplan is building a communications platform. A fibre-optic backbone that connects the building and the people using it. This network allows the functions of the building, like building management systems data, be collected as well as data on offerings, like gyms or end-of-trip facilities, creating rich data sets that can be collected and analysed. “ Technology is only the vehicle though. It is how we experience places and spaces, and interact with our services that drives and unlocks the potential for digital technology. ” Paul Sloman Arup Fellow Designing for experiences Making no assumptions, we have developed a discovery program to better understand what people might want and how those experiences could be delivered. This research builds an understanding of the types of experiences that will provide enhanced enjoyment and engagement with the built environment. Experiences that allow people to work more collaboratively and more creatively. Improving the quality and utility of spaces through adaptability based on personal choice. When you buy a ticket to a major sports event, in many cities these days it includes transport to and from the stadium. With a digital masterplan the potential experiences go far beyond that, to offer a seamless door-to-door event and beyond. Order food to your seats, get step-by-step wayfinding, enjoy a last minute seat upgrade, receive post-match analysis tailored for you. The same opportunities can make a visit to an art gallery, theatre, or museum even more engaging. Access more information at your finger-tips, or curate your own personal tour or experience. Buildings are no longer islands Buildings no longer need to be stand-alone structures in a city, they can talk to other infrastructure, transport, neighbouring places, and most importantly, people. Integrated data from building management systems, housed in a sharable network, can be securely combined with other data to deliver these experiences now, and expand as user needs change. This means our built environments are able to adapt and evolve as we do. Digital technologies are rapidly evolving and strategies need to be in place to prepare for current expectations and future opportunities. We might not know exactly what they are yet, but we do know that they will be built on the availability of and access to data. Designing for digital in the built environment requires an end-to-end approach that allows all components to talk to each other. Starting with digital masterplanning as the first step we can build our cities and spaces for the experiences we want and prepare them for the ones we can’t even imagine yet.

173,Under the viaduct ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/under-the-viaduct,,"Viaducts within cities hold a strong shared association. They can be dark, ominous places, and in many urban contexts sit within poorly maintained or sparsely populated areas. The viaduct as film trope, particularly in the case of the elevated railway, serves as a signifier of urban decay, a visual cue for areas of crime, dilapidation, and literal ‘wrong side of the tracks’ socio-economic segregation. This perception is not wholly unearned, poorly designed elevated structures can pose significant barriers between communities, and those ‘left over’ spaces beneath are inherently uninviting. As a consequence, they are typically underused and gradually worsen in condition. This needn’t be the case. Around the world, there are examples of creative and attractive utilisation of the space beneath viaducts. Paris’ Viaduct des Arts, has transformed 19th century railway arches into a beautiful series of arts and craft-related shops, creative studios and galleries in its undercrofts, and delivers significant uplift to the surrounding streets and promenade above. A similar example in a completely different context is London’s Westbourne Studios, with stunning accommodation for a cluster of creative businesses and artists nestled under a motorway. “ As cities grow and become denser, the focus on maximising the community and economic value of urban land will continue to intensify. ” Matt Lally Associate Director Disconnected and underutilised space is less tenable than in the past and the creative place-making impacts and opportunities of infrastructure design is better understood. Here in Australia, whilst many of our new roads and railways are being built underground or at surface level, inevitably with land constraints, many elevated structures will be built over the coming years, sometimes through the middle of urban areas. Arup is partnering with Roads and Maritime NSW, Transport for NSW, and UrbanGrowth NSW to explore the potential of these spaces in a new study entitled Under the Viaduct: Neglected Space No Longer. The study is considering potential reuse options for existing viaducts, as well as better design options to account for these spaces in new infrastructure. The study has been inspired by Arup’s involvement in Under the Elevated, a design project in New York City exploring the transformation opportunities for NYC’s 700 miles of elevated infrastructure.

Yet with fore-thought and imagination these elevated structures can provide ‘under-places’ rich in potential. ” Matt Lally Associate Director Drawing inspiration from international best-case examples, such as those referenced above, a range of Australian and overseas ‘demonstrator’ sites have been chosen to better understand limiting factors and test what reuses might be possible. Concept designs will bring potential re-uses to life. The opportunities are all around us. Think of the retrofitting potential for public space, amenable thoroughfares or even accommodation beneath Sydney’s Western Distributor at key overpasses Sussex, Harris and Kent Sts, or the new-build aspirations for the rail viaducts of Melbourne’s level crossing removal programme. The most exciting possibilities may lie in ‘infill’ applications. Inserting occupiable spaces beneath larger viaducts can unlock versatile, affordable space. It also allows opportunities to better integrate the existing piece of infrastructure into the existing urban fabric, aesthetically and functionally. Roads and Maritime Services new offices beneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge show what can be achieved with imagination, and also delivered major cost savings for the public purse. With so many options available, there is good reason to believe that under the viaduct will be neglected spaces no longer soon enough. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

174,Healthy kids and healthy lifestyles ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/healthy-kids-and-healthy-lifestyles,,"We’ve seen recent headlines question the value of spending AU$45m on a World Cup bid and AU$1.3bn on new stadiums in Sydney’s Moore Park and Parramatta. We’ve also seen the counter view that there is inherent value to the community in making such bids and building such facilities. Even in these times of tight government purse strings, sports spending announced in the federal budget is AU$345m of our hard earned taxes. When combined with state and local governments’ investments, the figure is well into the billions. With all this spending, there have been renewed calls to follow the American model. Wealthy patrons buy clubs and build the stadiums, so governments spend less on sport overall, but particularly less on large stadiums and major sporting events, channelling that money into healthcare or education. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. “ Melbourne sports precinct defines the value of the city as a whole. AAMI Park has a global profile and has grown the soccer code. What is the value of that to the community? Is it measured by the millions of dollars invested at the time, or is it intrinsically worth so much more to the community? ” Peter Bowtell Australasia Building Design Leader I disagree with this approach in Australia. The return on government spending to both the economy and the community is easily justified. In 2013-14, the sports industry generated a massive AU$14.6bn in revenue. But more important than the bottom-line, is the transformative power sport has and the key role it plays in both our urban and rural cities. We have to look at the benefits of these investments on a more holistic basis, not just a financial one. Sport is a part of our culture and our national psyche. It’s inseparable from community health and well-being. It’s where you learn team behaviours, leadership and so many valuable life skills. Our stadiums and other smaller sports facilities have an opportunity to reflect and embrace this as a key part of our community life. However, this doesn’t mean we should turn a blind eye to a stadium’s bottom line. This is where smart design and operation can turn a stadium or smaller sports facility from a white elephant to an important part of a city’s identity and global brand. So, what value does the broader community get from stadiums or major international sporting events? There is a real challenge around commercial drivers and legacy issues behind events like the Olympic and Commonwealth Games but recent experience in cities like London show that you can get this balance right. A holistic view will always consider the legacy outcome. In what ways can this asset add value to communities? Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch.

The Singaporean government recognised that increased participation in sport would be a major driver of community health in Singapore. At Olympic level, Singapore’s sporting greats hailed from table tennis, weightlifting and swimming. But in line with an increase in funding for elite sports, the city has now grown facilities around athletics, gymnastics, shooting, badminton, and of course football … a whole range of sports to drive the kids off the couch and into the arena. They wanted something that would focus their leisure time and drive the benefits of a healthy community with a strong sports ethic for decades to come, inevitably saving money in the long term. Australia has been successful at maintaining sports stadiums as places to bring communities together safely. However, affordability is becoming a major challenge as family pricing continues to rise. As ticket prices increase, so too do the expectations of ticket holders. Service and experience delivered have to rise to meet these, and are key reasons why we need to evolve our stadiums over time. Match day has to be better than the ‘in-home’ experience. Some of the biggest complaints from stadium users stem from simple issues, such as the length of time waiting in the toilet queue at half time. Sports fans may still want to be part of the tribe, but they don’t want match day to feel like an episode of ‘Survivor’. They are paying large money and expect to be entertained accordingly, with a higher level of facility and amenity, in a family friendly way. Simple factors, such as comfort, good sight lines, Wi-Fi, convenience, atmosphere, and close proximity to the field of play, and best-in-class team facilities, are all steps to improving experience of the game. They are essential elements of longevity and legacy of stadiums, and vital in order to drag spectators away from their TV’s! Major innovations as extreme as infinity pool hot tubs in corporate suites, and holograms simulating away games on field, could be the next steps to remaining cutting edge and ensuring customer experience. The best and most successful contemporary stadiums are integrated into the fabric of the communities and they have become innovative, complex and sophisticated multi-purpose buildings, designed to be beautiful, environmentally sensitive and have a high degree of flexibility in future and current use. The best thing we can encourage though, is healthy children and lifestyles. Sport is a fundamental part of achieving that, and facilities play a vital role. Many codes wield a larger influence on our community than politicians. They motivate and influence the community at large. We shouldn’t underestimate the power of sport as a unifying body. It is far too simplistic to say these things don’t pay for themselves. They should be built to the size that feels full on a regular basis Yes, some fans will miss out and we will eventually need to build new stadiums to meet spectator demand, but full = atmosphere = growth & building on success = longevity.

175,"If you know the right questions and understand the risks, data can help build better cities ",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/if-you-know-the-right-questions-and-understand-the-risks-data-can-help-build-better-cities,,"Mobile devices have explosively transformed the digital environment as we know it, putting power into the hands of individual consumers. One of the key elements sitting behind this transformation is data. Data is incredibly important in how end users experience their environment, do their work and live their lives. It’s about people, as opposed to being about machines or systems. With people at the centre of the data jigsaw, it’s easy to understand why so many are getting on board the data train – businesses, governments at all levels, large developers, transport operators, people developing or modifying precincts and mixed use environments...the list goes on. They see that with data comes opportunity and commercial solutions. Sharing data enables new experiences to be built which people will enjoy and that will benefit their lives. Opening up data acknowledges that data is providing the building blocks for a new economy. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Take something as ubiquitous as the weather. We check a weather app to determine what we will do or wear, other apps access the weather information from the Bureau of Meteorology (or elsewhere) and they use that to create new value, a new output, such as choosing alternate seats at a venue if rain is predicted, or adjusting travel time to a certain area. City of Melbourne runs an Open Data Platform which geo-locates every tree, rubbish bin, and parking space in the city. Anyone in the world can access this information, and a number of government agencies, universities, and organisations are using this data right now to inform future decisions for the city – whether that be at a policy level, a plan or something to implement. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Opportunity vs risk While the opportunities are seemingly endless (see case study 1: Vodafone), when it comes to sharing data and allowing open access data platforms, there is a need for caution. Privacy, identity theft, and reliability of data are just some of the key risks we need to be mindful of when it comes to sharing and curating data. When you make data available, you need to understand how that data is being used, who is using it, if the structure of the data has been changed and myriad other considerations. Curation is important but with it comes the need for vigilance and a very open approach to labelling how the information has been curated and what it potentially means for various people. People will want access to the raw data wherever they can, or at the very least they will need to understand the pipeline of processing that has been undertaken in that data by the time they have access to it, so they can better apply their own analysis to that data to achieve the right outcome. App developers want to know data is reliable enough for them to build a robust application or perhaps a business. “ An additional side effect of the data revolution is our ‘digital lint’ is growing greater and broader which has positive and negative implications. ” Greg Stone Global Head of Corporate Development On the one hand, there is a liberation that comes with new opportunities to create value from data, but on the other hand there is a loss of control that individuals have about the way data can be used – perhaps even against them. This tension will grow over time. On the face of it, we should make as much data available publicly as possible; but the more data you get, the more you can correlate that data into something that identifies individuals, or in the case of security provides the processor with a richness of understanding and as a result we can be analysed in ways we might not particularly like. What's next? But out of risk or challenge often comes opportunity and as new projects in our cities are being enriched with digital experiences like never before (such as wayfinding, seamless connectivity via large touch screen displays and so on), we are tackling these challenges head on with some clever ideas (see case study 2: Sydney light rail). Data needs to sit behind a very easy to access and well managed API (Application Programming Interface) which enables developers to plug and play with data easily, and also allows a safe and secure separation between the owners, curators and those who seek to use it. This allows them to focus their efforts on the sort of data that is most useful for the community and measure that by the way it’s used. In terms of what the future holds for the data story, end users will still have the power in their hands. Case study 1: Vodafone in Wales Arup used mobile data to understand the travel patterns of people from home to their ultimate destination at work – which completely changed the way the road design was planned. Historically there have been certain ways to determine people’s routes from where they live to place of work. But when we analysed the data we found the routes people took involved activities like dropping off kids to childcare or picking up other people. The journeys weren’t simple straight lines and when we understood this in detail, it enabled a much more optimised highway design that met the needs of people. Case study 2: Light rail project in Sydney To overcome the challenges associated with numerous trades’ and providers’ installation schedules clashing, Arup built models that brought in all data from different providers (such as electricity, council, telco, road, etc) and helps them to understand over a period of time where the clashes are. Being able to work around each other ensures they don’t cause discomfort for people in surrounding areas and also ensures a streamlined approach to these providers completing their work."
176,How can we make zero-carbon high-rise a reality? ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-can-we-make-zero-carbon-high-rise-a-reality,,"As urbanisation around the world drives demand for high-rise buildings, I think making those buildings zero-carbon is one of the biggest challenges facing engineers. Even if you use known passive and active design strategies to reduce energy use in a building, you still need quite a lot of energy to ensure occupants are comfortable. The building can generate its own renewable energy, of course, but the energy from renewables such as solar PV is directly proportional to the surface area of a building. The extra surface area of a high-rise building isn’t enough to offset the extra energy demand of each additional floor. So if we want zero-carbon high-rise buildings, we need to make renewable energy generation more efficient and reduce energy use. I don’t think this can come from better building design alone. Energy management, energy audits, measurement and verification are also needed to ensure building operations are efficient. For example, I think we need to use more passive design in buildings, and install more task lighting to supplement natural lighting. We could also adopt less formal dress codes at work so that buildings don’t need to be kept at the same temperature all year round. And encouraging a diet that’s lower in meat would make a difference too. Reducing energy use also relies on behaviour change. Younger generations in Asia seem to be more eco-conscious than their elders, as authors Mark Clifford and Janet Pau argue in their book Through the Eyes of Tiger Cubs, and I’m confident that their forward-looking approach will help reduce energy use. However, I think efforts to achieve zero-carbon should go beyond individual buildings and extend to improving the overall efficiency of a community by integrating district energy systems. A micro energy grid enables systems to work together across different buildings, producing economies of scale. If you centralise energy conservation systems, you can make them as much as 20-25% more efficient, applying better technology at bigger scales. We’ve seen savings like this on the Korea Micro Energy Grid (KMEG) project in China. District energy systems can provide power, heating and cooling for all. As well as improving efficiency, you can also manage maintenance more effectively by having a single entity responsible for it. And as individual buildings don’t have to accommodate their own equipment, they can use the valuable floor space for other things. In Hong Kong, two developments that will use district cooling are underway: West Kowloon Cultural District Development and Kai Tak. The Kai Tak system is due to be completed in 2021 and is expected to save around 85 million kWh of electricity annually. That’s equivalent to cutting about HK$76.5m off the electricity bill and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 59,500 tonnes. I think these district energy systems with micro grid schemes point the way to a zero-carbon high-rise future."
177,Green building envelopes for lower city temperatures ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/green-building-envelopes-for-lower-city-temperatures,,"The ongoing march to greater urbanisation challenges designers to create interventions that ensure cities remain liveable. The positive and balancing role played by trees, plants and green space in cities is well understood, but building design could play a more active part in terms of acoustic performance, air pollution and the urban heat island effect. I believe that by greening the external ‘envelopes’ of a city’s buildings there is a great opportunity to offset the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect that’s driving up urban temperatures. This effect is a result of cities’ combination of heat-retaining structures, dense population, waste heat from building operations, and other human factors. These raised temperatures in turn encourage their populations to use more energy to artificially lower the temperature or improve ventilation in their area – outcomes that are neither desirable nor sustainable. Green building envelopes could offset these unwanted gains. The building envelope refers to its roof, façade and any other areas that connect the inside to the outside, usually representing 20-25% of a building’s total external area. Even in the height of summer, interventions like vegetated roofs can help bring down the temperature to ambient levels, whereas a conventional roof can be up to 50 degrees higher. Green envelopes can be retroactively applied to buildings’ exteriors too, making them an economically viable adaptation that can transform the urban built environment’s long-term performance. The opportunities take many forms, from living walls that shield sunlight and noise as they lower the temperature, to roof gardens that replace lost urban squares. Managing an effect as complex and dynamic as urban climate requires a context-sensitive approach and rigorous planning. Research needs to focus at both the city-wide and neighbourhood scales. Research conducted in 2007 showed that if Greater Manchester increased its green infrastructure by 10% (in areas with limited or no green cover) the city would reduce its average temperature by up to 2.5 degrees centigrade, greatly offsetting the UHI effect. Some densely developed cities like Singapore are already leading the way. Their Sustainable Growth Strategy has set a target of 0.8ha of green space per 1,000 persons, aiming to increase greenery in high-rise buildings to 50ha by 2030. Reducing the UHI effect is the goal, closely followed by improvements to air quality, noise reduction, storm water attenuation and increased urban biodiversity. Any kind of city can benefit from this commitment to finding green potential from within its structures and layout, from the wide lanes of a city like Los Angeles to the narrow streets and squares of an ancient Asian capital. By rethinking and greening the exteriors of our buildings we can build cities that are more resilient, enjoyable and suitable for their growing populations."
178,Walking towards stronger communities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/walking-towards-stronger-communities,,"Social interaction between people is a fundamental feature of a thriving urban experience. The ability to navigate a city on foot, pleasantly and without fear is a strong mark of a city’s strength and social resilience. I believe that by creating more walkable environments, use of public space will intensify, raising the frequency and quality of informal social interactions between people. In essence, walking builds stronger communities. As a stage for community experiences, public spaces are vital, and a walkable environment can dramatically boost opportunities for people meeting, sharing and mixing. As argued by William H. Whyte: “What attracts people most, it would appear, is other people”. Streets are the most important context for public life. In San Francisco, during the late 1960s, Donald Appleyard, Professor of Urban Design at the University of California, conducted a comparison of three streets identical in every dimension except for levels of traffic (‘light’, ‘moderate’ and ‘heavy’), in order to show that the mere presence of cars can crush the quality of social life in neighbourhoods. His research demonstrated that residents of streets with light car traffic volumes had three times as many friends and twice as many acquaintances as those living on a street with high car traffic. Thus, there is a strong correlation between the walkable areas and a feeling of belonging to a local community. An Irish study found that residents living in walkable neighbourhoods exhibit at least 80% greater levels of social capital than those living in car-dependent ones. For instance, they are more likely to know – and therefore to trust – their neighbours and get involved in local issues and politics. Where there’s a strong sense of community, social activism naturally follows. Across the world, community-led projects are on the rise, as demonstrated by the proliferation of ‘do-it-yourself’ crowdfunded initiatives to maintain or improve aspects of daily life. For example, in 2013, a group of residents of Ghent, Belgium, suggested the idea of building a network of temporary car-free zones, a project that was a huge popular success. In May 2015, 22 of Ghent’s busiest streets were closed to traffic and converted into Living Streets for ten weeks, featuring pop-up parks and bars, helping local people to play, relax and socialise. By designing for walkability urban planners are also ensuring a level of social cohesion that transcends age and social groups. Ultimately, everyone is a pedestrian. In particular, a recent Arup study shows that 27% of older European adults (65 years and over) choose walking as their main mode of transport. Moreover, American surveys demonstrate that for those under 35 years old, the preference for living in houses where they can walk to shops and have a short commute is 51%. For a city’s youngest inhabitants, walking to school is very beneficial, providing exercise, the chance to socialise with their peers, fostering independence and improving academic performance according to some studies. For all these reasons I believe walkability ought to be a foundational part of designers’ approach to shaping cities, and thus shaping communities. You can find out more in the recent Arup publication Cities Alive: Towards a walking world."
179,Is green belt policy fit for purpose?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/is-green-belt-policy-fit-for-purpose,,"I believe that green belt needs a fundamental re-think because it holds some of the answers to the UK’s housing crisis. First introduced in 1938, green belt is often cited as one of the great successes of our planning system. Even today, its fundamental aim, as set out in national policy, remains unchanged – “to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open”. Recently, the UK Government boldly announced, “there’s no need to build on Green Belt” to deliver long-promised homes. The solution, it says, is to loosen planning controls on brownfield sites and “get on with it”. According to the latest research, there is sufficient brownfield land to deliver at least a million homes in England alone. This raises several questions. Firstly, given that projections suggest 220,000 new households will be formed every year until 2022, will this be enough? Secondly, is this land in the right place and developable for the right price? Local authority planning officers maintain that developers have no interest in existing brownfield sites, claiming they’re unviable and undeliverable. Which leads to me to my overarching question – can we solve the UK ‘housing crisis’ by focusing on brownfield land alone? My view is no. So however sensitive the topic may be, we have to accept that green belt holds some of the answers. So what of the mechanism that allows councils to review their green belts? Through a series of commissions by local authorities, Arup has continually refined the process of green belt review, developing a robust but flexible approach which balances the requirements of national planning policy, the five purposes which green belt should serve, against local context. We have found that the devil is often in the detail, yet national policy and guidance provides little more than the bare bones. Even worse, the bones themselves may be fractured. Are the five purposes the most relevant and appropriate concepts for defining green belt in the 21st century, or have our urban areas evolved to such an extent that we need to think again? Green belt is a strategic policy and while most councils seek input from stakeholders, usually this doesn’t go far enough and often overlooks impacts beyond their boundaries. Another area where understanding is limited is the intrinsic link between the supply of green belt and the deliverability of brownfield land. Perhaps a strategic, pan-regional body is needed to assess the role of green belts and their negative impacts? And what about beyond the UK? Green belt is a unique concept, so how have other planning systems coped with urban sprawl, and are there any lessons to be learned? What is clear is that the UK Government cannot simply bury the issue. The current framework emphasises setting local targets for housing delivery. While this remains the case, local authorities will question how they can deliver their visions and ensure that the green belt remains sacrosanct, particularly if they have no suitable brownfield sites to put forward."
180,Two wheels better: enabling city cyclists ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/two-wheels-better-enabling-city-cyclists,,"In an ever urbanising world, the social benefits of increased cycling are well established. From personal fitness to reduced pressure on mass transit networks, cycling has many net positives. But often city policies fail to support widespread use of bicycles. I believe we can change this by focusing on latent demand and the barriers to cycling that people cite. A report from the London School of Economics has defined the latent demand for cycling as being those consumers with a desire to get into cycling which they’ve thus far been unable to satisfy. Sport England’s Active People survey in 2009/2010 identified 2,215,700 ‘latent’ cyclists in England – a growth of 6.6% in two years. Recent successes in cycling in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics are further expected to increase latent demand for cycling. Safety remains a major barrier. Research from Portland, USA, classifies four types of cyclist: the ‘strong and fearless’ who cycle everywhere and anywhere; the ‘enthused and confident’ who cycle but only on roads where they feel relatively safe; the ‘interested but concerned’ who would like to cycle but are put off by road conditions; and the ‘no way, no how’ group, who simply do not want to cycle at all. The latent demand for cycling is considerable, 60% of people identifying as ‘interested but concerned’. Mass cycling is possible but we must listen to the concerns of this group and design our cities and streets to accommodate them. Transport for London research carried out in 2011 established that safety concerns are most likely to be cited as a deterrent to increasing/taking up cycling, with 90% of those surveyed reporting that traffic makes them afraid of cycling on London’s streets. Safety was a deterring factor for 69% of those considering taking up cycling. We can draw many lessons from countries like the Netherlands, where half of all trips made are by bike, a reflection of the high quality infrastructure provided by their ‘Sustainable Safety’ approach to road design. Years of supportive policy making have led to widespread confidence in and adoption of cycling. Indeed, according to Dr Rachel Aldred, Reader in Transport at the University of Westminster, research shows that Dutch women of 80 are 80 times more likely to cycle than their British counterparts. To enable cycling, London has moved beyond simply painting blue cycle lanes on busy roads to creating fully segregated cycle superhighways. Today nearly as many trips are made each day in London by cycle as by passengers on Dockland Light Railway and Overground trains added together. Physical infrastructure isn’t the only consideration however. Adapting cities to cope with increased and safer cycling requires thoughtful planning around local community needs, the business agenda and many other factors. For this reason community-wide liaison is vital, taking the time to hear from all stakeholders can mitigate issues while building ground-up support for cycling."
181,Walkable cities are healthy cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/walkable-cities-are-healthy-cities,,"Walking networks lay the foundation of how we experience cities and how those cities function, providing a series of benefits to both the individual and the collective. “ Walking positively transforms a city’s health, economic productivity, and ecological outlook. For us as individuals, it influences how we connect with family, friends, work, and nature. ” Safiah Moore Senior Planner Our newly launched report, Cities Alive: Towards a Walking World, considers these drivers alongside actions to further enhance walkability in cities, international design and policy examples, and perhaps most importantly, the multitude of quantified benefits that a walking world can deliver. It features perspectives across the built environment – transport specialists, economists and urban designers, from areas as diverse as Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Milan and more. Whilst the wellbeing and sustainability outcomes of walking may be clear, creating walkable environments can be the catalyst for so many broad advantages – social inclusivity, cultural activity, increased land values, city attractiveness, and civic responsibility to name but a few. This sentiment is perhaps best captured here, by international walkability expert and author Jeff Speck. “ Get walkability right and so much of the rest will follow. ” Jeff Speck Walkability is a conversation Sydney should be involved in. Alongside the general benefits of walking for our cities, it aligns clearly with three key future challenges we face as a city: Sydney competes on a global stage to retain and attract talent. Walkable areas, both in their utility and their contribution to city amenity and enhancing the attractiveness of a city to professional talent. According to the study Foot traffic ahead by the George Washington University School of Business “The most walkable urban metro areas have substantially higher GDPs per capita and percentages of college graduates over 25 years of age in the population. The 2015 Intergenerational Report predicts Australians will live longer and continue to have the one of the longest life expectancies in the world. Like many developed cities, growth in older age groups is being experienced across Sydney. According to ‘The Build Environment and Getting People Active’, evidence suggests that legible and direct street networks are particularly important in encouraging active transport in more vulnerable demographic groups such as children and the elderly. Evidence also suggests that people aged 60 and over who do just 15 min of exercise a day reduce their risk of dying early by 22%. With a growing body of evidence connecting health, economic and social benefits with walking, the walkability of our suburbs becomes of great interest to decision makers and designers in the built environment. “ With a growing body of evidence connecting health, economic and social benefits with walking, the walkability of our suburbs becomes of great interest to decision makers and designers in the built environment. ” Safiah Moore Senior Planner Many of these benefits are known, but bringing the research together in one place provides a powerful call for action for us to reflect as design practitioners to design with a human perspective – where walking and cycling, or more broadly, wheeling, becomes the first mode of connecting people to each other, to play, and to productivity. From this perspective, we can explore a series of experience of the street; a place for chance interactions, an extension of the playground for children, or an experimental gallery for installations.

182,Using PARK(ing) to rethink housing availability in Sydney,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/parking-and-housing,,"As our cities host larger and more diverse populations, we will need to modify our transport networks, recast the way we think about affordable, appropriate housing and explore better utilisation of public space and facilities. In the face of all of this, we need to rethink the way that we engage with the city about change. Founded in San Francisco by design collective REBAR, PARK(ing) Day is an international initiative which takes over metered parking spaces one day in September each year. Parks for cars are transformed into parks for people, celebrating public space and generating dialogue about our urban environments. Each PARK(ing) Day, Arup has reclaimed a Sydney CBD parking spot and used our installation to discuss a local city challenge, including productivity, creativity, and city soundscapes. This year we queried housing availability. Using recycled materials we built our ‘geodesic dome home’ in a few hours, and set up on the corner of Hickson Road and Napoleon Street. We dropped our ‘rent’ into the parking meter at $5.60 per hour and took advantage of harbour views across Barangaroo, walking access to parks, transport and world class cultural facilities. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Whilst cost effective to build, we calculated our weekly rent (not including changes to parking restrictions throughout the day) at approximately $940, not dissimilar to rental prices in some suburbs of Sydney. $940 per week represents 50% of a median ‘moderate’ household income, which would place a household in this band in ‘housing stress’ while living in a parking space. Our home was placed in front of the backdrop of UNSW City Future’s Sydney Housing Affordability Index. The index visualises housing affordability pressures in Sydney – responding to the question: ‘What proportion of property sales are affordable to a household earning $100,000?’. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. The Index shows that in 2015, within 10kms of the Sydney CBD, less than 20% of property sales were affordable to households with an annual income of $100,000. Visualising the index shows that most of the Sydney Metropolitan Area experiences these pressures, with almost all of the city providing less than 20% affordable housing or 20-39% affordable housing based on a moderate household income. We invited citizens to step off the footpath so that we could hear their views on housing in Sydney: “If I didn’t buy my house 10 years ago, I wouldn’t be able to buy there today…” “#dreamhome2050” “More micro-homes and granny flats” “For sale price: 20 times your annual Gen Y salary” “Cheaper to commute than to live in Sydney” “I’ve lost all hope at 22” “What housing do we need for our big growth in old people + kids…will they fit?” This last comment directs us towards the questions being asked of housing in Sydney. We all need to be better informed about the types of households Sydney needs to thrive, and how these are changing. We need to understand changes in housing tenure to support housing transition, and of course, continue to have conversations with the city – in a creative way."
183,The look and feel of great sport,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-look-and-feel-of-great-sport,,"As the dust settles on the feats of the world’s greatest sportspeople in the most impressive of sports venues, it’s worth appreciating that the Olympic Games is as much a celebration of design as it is sport. Every element of the games is designed: the stadiums, the torch, the cauldron, the ceremonies, the outfits, the merchandise, the dais, the medals, even the lanyards. All of these must form part of the story of the games for that particular city. The Olympic Games is unique in its prohibition of advertising signage throughout its sports venues. The only brands that are noticeable across its precincts are the Olympic rings and The Games brand for the host city, like Rio 2016. This emphasis on the extensive and high quality graphic design that features right across almost every part of event delivery is known as The Games 'look and feel'. The 'look and feel' of the Games is the overarching design strategy for all those non-descript surfaces that feature in audiences’ line of sight. Most importantly the 'look and feel' should capture and reflect the atmospherics and brand of that particular event city. It should enhance the Games experience. It is most prominent as the backdrop to the events in each venue. It’s also used as bunting to the temporary fence and hording outside the stadium. The temporary event overlay often features on portable buildings and security fencing. Never ending lengths of fabric provide the Games look and assists in giving the back of house elements a front of house feel. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. It also enhances the visuals to the audience of the broadcast experience. Even some of the smallest surface locations provides this 'look and feel' branding opportunity; like the end of the Gymnastics beam or the edge of the high jump bar. These surfaces can feature more prominently when the action is filmed close up and in slow motion. The games lanyard also provides the same opportunity; when the camera zooms in on the gold medal within frame is the games brand, the 'look and the feel'. It provides the event city with promotional advertising that is consumed subliminally by the viewer. London 2012 Featured more traditional colours, predominately purples and reds, and more contemporary triangles and diagonals. A different and more contemporary look that referenced the triangular structural lines of the London Eye, The Gherkin and the Olympic stadium itself. Rio 2016 A series of arcs of green acknowledging Rio's vegetation, Sugarloaf Mountain, the blue of the ocean, and the yellow sand of its famous beaches - with a touch of Rio carnival. Athens 2004 Heavily referenced the blues and whites of the Greek flag, and the Mediterranean Sea and its traditional white rendered buildings. Sydney 2000 Unsurprisingly utilised emerald blue-green and arched lines referencing the Harbour Bridge, the Sydney Opera House and Stadium Australia. Beijing 2008 Was predominately red, referencing the red ribbons that bind traditional scripts and parchments, with a similarity to the 'Birds Nest' Stadium and alluding to the continuous flow of Calligraphy. “ The ability to tie together the look and feel of the games is not just isolated to Olympic Games, it’s a strategic way of thinking. It allows sporting precincts for any major event to provide a more cohesive front of house presentation and enhanced spectator experience. ” Justin Madden Cities Consultant It delivers a narrative greater than the sum of its parts. Drawing together venues, event, people and culture. It can convey atmospherics that even the best postcard shots cannot deliver. It brands an event city and delivers a pitch in a way that compels audiences from around the world to visit and do business in preference to the other great competitive cities across the globe. This thought is a driver for the master plan at the Melbourne and Olympic Park Sports precinct currently being undertaken. We need to draw together a series of standalone facilities into a legible and cohesive narrative that enhances the spectator experience and showcases a 'look and feel' that celebrates Melbourne - and its reputation as the world’s most liveable city."
184,"Cities, cars and setting greener standards ",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-cars-and-setting-greener-standards,,"In an era characterised by ever more flexible access to personal transport, I believe cities should set key performance indicators (KPI) and economic incentives to reduce the total number of cars within their municipal territory. This would make space for public use and improve cities’ green areas in general. I live in Copenhagen and I don’t own a car, as I mostly move around the city by bike or public transport. When I need a car, I either rent one from a private car sharing platform such as SnappCar or GoMore, or I use one of the new car-as-a-service (CaaS) companies such as Car2go or DriveNow. It is clearly more cost-effective for my family to adopt CaaS and not continue with the car ownership model. This transition would create the possibility of communal green benefits. As more cars are shared, fewer will be needed overall and the less city space they will occupy. Google calculated recently that in the US, if the use of cars could be optimised in this way the population’s driving needs could be served by just ten million self-driving cars. In this scenario cities will gain opportunities to convert urban spaces currently used for car parking into hard landscaped areas or public parks for the whole community. The city of Frederiksberg, located within the municipality of Copenhagen, has adopted a policy that everybody must be able to see at least one tree from wherever they live. If other municipalities were to commit to meet this requirement, one KPI they could give themselves is to reduce the total number of privately owned cars, every year, freeing up space for trees. Financial inducements will be key to achieving this, but cities make strategic investments and divestments all the time. The city of Copenhagen has recently sold its stake in shipping giant Maersk due to concerns about the company’s environmental impact. If municipalities are allowed to invest or partner with private companies, shouldn’t they actively partner and support organisations that can better help them meet their environmental goals? In the past national governments have often introduced incentives for purchasing new cars. Sometimes this is aimed at lowering the average age of the fleet, so as to reduce pollution; in other cases purchaser incentives are there to support the growth of the car industry and protect jobs. These interventions give a consumer a direct financial inducement to buy and own another vehicle. But forward-looking cities could just as easily offer incentives for car owners to get rid of their cars, provided they undertook not to buy a replacement. Incentives could take the form of credit with one of the many CaaS companies or free/cheaper travel cards for public transit networks. Of course personal logistical needs vary greatly, but I would argue that setting a lowering-car-ownership KPI and targeting incentives to encourage use of CaaS and public transport could greatly reduce the number of cars on our streets, promote car and ride sharing and allow cities’ green areas and public spaces to flourish."

186,Low stress cycling ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/low-stress-cycling,,"Cycling is an activity that can mean many things to so many people. From recreation to main mode of transport, from fitness to fun. However, for a number of people, cycling is something they would never consider even though they may have had a bike as a child. I still remember my first ‘proper’ bike and I am sure most you do. To me, getting my first bike was the start of my independence and freedom. When I wasn’t eating, sleeping or stuck at school I was on my bike, best friend in tow (who of course had the same bike). We would spend long summer days cycling as far as we could along the river track that meandered its way through our village in England. Since then I must admit my biking ‘career’ has peaked and troughed – from being a weekend warrior, to a commuter, to then allowing my bike to sit in the garage looking sad and forlorn with a flat tire. So why has my relationship with my bike been so stormy? Why have I not committed to this relationship? Then it came to me. Stress – moments of cycling stress have knocked my confidence and made other less stressful alternatives more attractive. “ From having my bike stolen to having to reroute my ride into the office through busy arterial roads and steep hills – it all became too hard. ” Now my personal experiences have shaped how I approach cycle planning with an emphasis on user experiences. So what do we mean when we talk about low stress cycling? Every segment of road and path accessible by bike can be categorised based on its level of traffic stress. The level of stress depends on a number of characteristics – road width, traffic volumes, traffic speed, the presence and position of parked cars and whether bicycles are mixed with traffic, in bike lanes or on segregated paths. The level of stress felt by cyclists can vary depending on their individual tolerance levels. This is an important factor to consider when determining the potential end users of a cycling route. There are a number of popular schemes for classifying the stress tolerance levels of cyclists and potential cyclists, one of which was developed by Roger Geller, Portland’s bicycle coordinator. Geller categories cyclists into four groups based on their tolerance for traffic stress, namely the ‘strong and fearless’, the ‘enthused and confident’, the ‘interested and concerned’ and finally the ‘no way no how’ group The ‘strong and fearless’ and the ‘enthused and confident’ cyclists, to varying degrees, respond well to riding in almost any traffic conditions. Together these two groups make up about make up 7% of the population. The ‘no way no how’ group are at the complete opposite end of the scale and are not interested in riding a bicycle at all. They make up approximately 33% of the population. The ‘interested but concerned’ group make up a huge 60% of the population. They like riding a bicycle, and they would like to ride more, but they are afraid. They find situations in which they have to negotiate with traffic uncomfortable, but respond well to standalone paths and streets with little and slow traffic. Understanding road stress Building on from this the Mineta Transportation Institute in the US developed a set of criteria by which road segments can be classified into four levels of traffic stress, with level one reflecting the lowest level of stress and level four representing the highest. Routes with the lowest level of stress feature little traffic and therefore demand little attention from the cyclist and are attractive enough of a relaxing bike ride. Low stress routes are typically physically separated from traffic or on a shared road where interaction with cars is only occasional. Importantly, they are suitable for almost all cyclists, including children. At the other end of the scale, routes reflecting the highest level of stress, referred to as level 4, reflect cycling conditions involving riding in mixed traffic at speeds of 50km/h or more, or in bike lanes or shoulders next to traffic at highway speeds. These routes, quite common in city CBD’s, are only truly accessible by the strong and fearless who make up 7% of the population. So, think about the cycle paths in your local area. Are they ones you would feel confident to cycle on? Could you be persuaded to cycle more often if your route to work or the local shops was along more quite streets, bridges over busy roads and barriers separating the you from neighbouring traffic? This is what we need to address when planning our cycling strategies and infrastructure. Cycling is about more than getting from one place to another – the experience is just as important, if not more important, to ensure most people can enjoy the benefits of cycling as a viable mode of transport. Earlier this year I worked with the City of Whitehorse in Victoria to develop a cycling strategy focusing in the principles of cycling stress. The previous cycling strategy for Whitehorse focused on providing on-road infrastructure on the most direct routes throughout the municipality. As a result, the previous strategy did very little to influence travel change – and the proportion of residents cycling for work remained static during the life of the strategy. The last Census date demonstrated that only 0.7% of residents cycling to work when compared to 1.3% in Greater Melbourne. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. A new vision In response to this the vision for the new strategy is to increase cycling through the creation of a connected network of attractive, safe and inviting low stress streets and paths which are accessible to all and respects the needs of all users. In order to gain an understanding of Whitehorse’s existing and potential cycling community we undertook a range of community consultation events. Through this we were able to develop characteristics, specific to Whitehorse, for each of the four cycling groups. Interesting the characteristics of the Whitehorse community closely reflected the findings of the research undertaken in Portland by Bob Geller. Implementing safer ways for cyclists to cross main roads was a key consideration for all respondents, followed by more off-road shared paths. Those identifying as interested and concerned stated that there was a need or more safe linkages from established cycling routes to major activity centers. Using GIS we mapped the stress level of the municipality’s entire road network. The exercise revealed that 80% of the municipality’s road and shared path network is categorised as low stress. However, the mapping exercise also found that the majority of roads with dedicated on-road cycle lane facilities are categorised as high stress. As a result of the community engagement and mapping process we developed a set of six guiding principles for the development of a low stress network in the City of Whitehorse with a focus on wayfinding, better linking of low stress cycle paths and ‘easy ride’ options to local amenities, education facilities and employment hubs.The strategy was adopted in early 2016 and I look forward to seeing how successful approaching the development of the strategy from a low stress angle can be."
187,"Daylight, urban density and the role of regulation ",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/daylight-urban-density-and-the-role-of-regulation,,"For many centuries, humans have designed buildings to make the best of the elements and resources around them: resisting the wind and the rain, while taking advantage of the sun’s heat and light. But in modern cities design is driven by a more complex agenda, with a strong emphasis on commercial value, leading to cities full of taller, more densely packed buildings. I believe that if daylight guidelines were strategically implemented within building regulations, more naturally lit cities would evolve. The tall glass and steel towers that dominate the skylines of New York, Hong Kong, Sao Paulo or New Delhi, not only often make poor use of daylight, they cause secondary issues too. Strong wind effects are amplified by buildings’ proximity and height, and overheating and overshadowing are other common problems. As a result, the job of urban planners has become more focused on mitigation of these problems rather than applying regulations to work with and welcome natural environmental factors. Geometrically speaking, the more spread out a city is, in terms of lower building heights and greater distance between buildings, the more daylight can be harvested. Consequently, the more concentrated and dense a city is, the less daylight is available for its buildings and interiors. Electric light has made this level of urban density possible. This pivotal invention has transformed the traditional rhythm of day and night building use, making interiors usable at any hour. Once artificial light became a mass commodity, buildings could become deeper and taller environments, leaving occupants further from windows. In the era of the light bulb, design seems to have lost sight of the beneficial role played by natural daylight. But perhaps the twentieth century’s focus on highly populated buildings is no longer relevant. Modern technology like email and video-conferencing, potentially reduces the need for high density office environments. This raises the possibility that cities could embrace lower-rise buildings that make better use of natural light. And with improved natural daylight performance, buildings could also use the sun’s power as an energy source. The tools and technology to achieve these goals already exist. Today’s parametric design practices allow the dynamic and interconnected aspects of a proposed design to be modelled and understood. This helps designers to incorporate natural daylight considerations relevant to the proposed location and orientation of a building, street or site in ways never possible before. I believe that with the right building regulations a more strategic city-wide approach to maximising daylight could be taken. Vertical as well as horizontal surfaces (e.g. façades and rooftops) have a vital role to play. Regulatory encouragement for innovations like bio-reactive facades (where sunlight activates natural photosynthesis to provide power and heat) and solar panels would encourage building design that emphasizes natural daylight’s value. This could change the visual experience of our cities dramatically in the coming decades."
188,Building with nature to create sustainable cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/building-with-nature-to-create-sustainable-cities,,"Rapid urbanisation and migration continue to challenge the nature of our planet. In addition, pressures from climate change and flooding mean that cities need to find natural ways to adapt. I believe we need to understand and prioritise Green Infrastructure if we are to design sustainable, densely populated cities. Green Infrastructure (GI) provides the ‘ingredients’ for solving urban and climatic challenges, by building with nature. GI is defined by the UK communities agency as a ‘network of multifunctional green space, urban and rural, which is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities’. GI is not just conventional open green space but encompasses parks, woodlands, street trees, allotments, private gardens, green roofs and green walls. GI provides psychological, social and health advantages and a connection to nature, as well as a host of environmental benefits. Future cities will only prosper if they are understood as a complex adaptive system, where the relationship between humans and nature are entwined. However this complex relationship is often insufficiently considered during the design process, leading to negative environmental and social outcomes. There are many connected GI and human elements to consider with any new built environment project. For example, we know that light regulates seasonal and daily cycles of many plants and animals, and that globally there is a 6% increase in artificial lighting per year. Scientists are now considering the possibility that the direction, brightness and wavelength of urban artificial lighting could lead to growth deformities in plants, with subsequent impacts to reliant animal species. It has already been shown that climate change is disrupting flower pollination, causing bees to fly before flowers have bloomed and potentially affecting crop yields. It is clear that the dangers of unforeseen impacts on nature are real. Could a similar cycle of disruption resulting from other human influences affect the lifecycle of urban plants and animals? Some cities are already grappling with these issues pragmatically. For example, two major rivers flow through Philadelphia, but in the last 100 years widespread urbanisation has concretised and restricted these rivers and sewers, increasing impervious surfaces and ultimately increasing stormwater flooding. The city decided to use GI to restore the area’s natural capacity to capture water, using a multi-pronged strategy that included providing people with free rain barrels and replacing 30% of the city’s tarmac pavements and roads with porous ones. The Philadelphia Water Department also switched to a water metering system to monitor the volume of storm water that properties and businesses produce, subsequently incentivising them to retrofit their sites to include GI so that less water ends up in the sewer system. However, implementing GI also brings many obstacles. Ownership, cost, maintenance, space and knowledge of the benefits prevent many local authorities from implementing GI. Furthermore, public safety and vandalism can prove to be challenging to overcome in some cases. Designers and planners need to adopt a holistic way of thinking of these interdependent relationships when considering GI in city development. Additionally, relevant environmental impact data must be kept up to date. There also needs to be sufficient scientific understanding of the needs of various plant species to survive the ongoing impacts of a heavily human-modified landscape. To improve the way GI is dealt with requires greater awareness of these issues, driven through continued research and public dialogue. Only then will our cities coexist successfully with Green Infrastructure. Discover how we're using nature to help create more sustainable places"
189,How the digital world is shaping our cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-the-digital-world-is-shaping-our-cities,,"In the digital era, in order to thrive cities must offer innovative digital services that support the rapidly changing lifestyles and behaviours of their populations. I believe that this digital-driven ability to continuously improve efficiency is now central to a city’s long-term success. In developed nations, internet-powered smartphone apps have already started to transform many daily tasks, changing the way we think about the provision of goods and services, from travel to food shopping. Cities with a powerful supporting network of these services become more attractive for people who want to be able to get things done, whether it’s running a business or just managing their family life more easily. This in turn creates a virtuous circle by attracting more potential users or customers for these online services, helping them to grow and profit. In dense and diverse cities, developing new mobile businesses is easier with a larger addressable market for new services and established interest in innovation. Digital and location-based services are helping entrepreneurs, individuals and even governments to rethink services in new ways. Cities in developed nations should not assume they are leading in this area, and some developing cities are pushing forward at greater speeds with superior levels of adoption and innovation. In China over 550 million people use WeChat daily – able to quickly set up and run a business and communicate with social media followers and customers. Users can also make and receive payments, pay utility bills, access government offices, book hospital appointments, make transport reservations, read the news and much more, all from a single app. It doesn’t have a direct equivalent in either the USA or Europe. In a highly digital city, people’s access to services and goods is also less restricted by location than they once were. Affordable delivery-based businesses are helping both busy workers and older, less mobile people to take advantage of vital services. Instead of replacing traditional bricks and mortar businesses, these new online-to-offline (o2o) businesses are providing additional employment opportunities on top of existing ones. For example, over 250 million Chinese people use Dianping which offers portal-like access to group-buying, online restaurant reservation, take-out delivery, e-coupon promotions, and many other services, making it a valuable online partner to traditional local businesses. In this way, these platform businesses are helping small local suppliers to find bigger audiences for their product or service, while expanding employment in fields like warehousing, delivery, IT infrastructure and marketing, helping to build these cities’ long-term economic resilience. And digital innovation drives city popularity. A LinkedIn China survey has revealed how digitally innovative cities like Hangzhou or Wuhan are becoming the new ‘Tier-1’ cities, leapfrogging over traditional centres like Beijing and Shanghai. Hangzhou is where China’s huge trade website Alibaba is headquartered and its cluster of surrounding tech start-ups is encouraging growing numbers of people to relocate there. The digital world’s ability to reshape the fortunes of the physical city is now clear. City stakeholders including governments, academic institutions, investors and property developers need to cultivate an innovative environment through policy making, governance and administrative support. And by offering attractive working environments for tech incubators, cities can foster collaboration and skills sharing."
190,Refining design through virtual vibrations ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/refining-design-through-virtual-vibrations,,"Vibration has a fundamental impact on how a person perceives a place. Locations that are still and quiet are perceived as being solid and of high quality, while noisy, shaky spaces can be perceived as flimsy or unsafe. Fortunately new tools are helping us to design the real experience of physical spaces. As engineers, safety is always our first priority. But sometimes this focus on safety can obscure the impact design will have on the end-user experience. There is also the connected and mistaken assumption that architects are solely responsible for the quality of the spaces we design, when engineering of the specific elements will greatly influence what it’s like to experience a given space. Developing new tools to help us design spaces of the highest quality is about adding more refinement to our existing knowledge and processes, delivering experiences that are both safe and enjoyable. Whether it’s isolating a concert hall against noise from underground trains or damping tall buildings to reduce their sway, new tools are helping us achieve our aims for quality. Perception of vibration is subjective. A single number or chart cannot capture how someone will respond to a given motion, nor is there universal agreement on just how much vibration is too much. And in certain designs vibration and structural safety can be equal in importance. For the Las Vegas High Roller observation wheel, a motion platform was used to predict vibrations from the strong desert winds, simulating the possible sway of the passenger cabins. No matter the weather, this helped ensure a comfortable experience on the ride all year round. The Arup Motion Platform is a tool developed to help predict and understand these effects. It’s a calibrated ‘shake table’ which allows engineers to simulate vibrations in a controlled environment. This allows clients, architects and engineers to model and experience motions from their projects before they’re built, rather than relying on reports or abstract numbers. It is used to engage stakeholders in the design process in a compelling new way. The Arup Motion Platform has been invaluable on several large projects where vibration was a critical issue, giving our engineers the opportunity to play out various design and material options, so that cost-sensitive project decisions could be made with confidence. Gathering measurements to plan on the Motion Platform has traditionally been a difficult process, requiring expensive and sensitive equipment. To overcome this, Arup has been developing a simple app for the iPhone that uses the phone’s built in accelerometer (which measures tilt) to measure vibrations. The data captured can then be replayed through the Motion Platform, putting useful information in the hands of building owners, operators or occupants without the need for additional and expensive sensing hardware. These kinds of tools help build design confidence on increasingly ambitious projects, creating designs that are not only safe but also create a great user experience. Apps and widely available consumer technology clearly have much potential for designers and engineers, so do please use the comments to share any other useful modelling apps you’ve encountered in your work."
191,Urban climate change resilience is vital ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/urban-climate-change-resilience-is-vital,,"In the last decade the understanding of the threats and risks cities face has deepened greatly, not least due to the Asia Cities Climate Change Network. Urban Climate Change Resilience (UCCR) refers to the ability of cities to manage the threats an increasingly urban population faces due to climate change and associate risks. But beyond its core agenda of dealing with climate change, UCCR also presents cities with an incredible opportunity to tackle existing failures of urban development. Awareness of the importance of city resilience as a critical urban development agenda is growing, as are the benefits of investing in resilience. In the international development community we used to speak in terms of planning for disaster risk reduction (DRR). Now resilience means looking at ways cities can withstand, adapt and transform, staying focused on long-term benefits rather than short-term fixes. History is full of examples of cities turning uncovered weakness into advantages. Think about London after the Great Fire or again, after the Blitz. We rebuilt with a clearer vision of how to improve. Rather than focusing on single threats, UCCR recognizes that climate change may result in a wide range of hazards, which it’s impossible to predict. It addresses risk as part of a wider agenda emphasizing the importance of inclusive governance and integrated planning. The governance issue is key. If cities are to become truly resilient, the population must have a voice: consultation breeds better long-term decision making. UCCR represents a maturation of the climate change agenda. In the last decade the climate change sceptics have finally been silenced, not just by the growing evidence base, but by cities across the world responding to the real change they’re experiencing locally. The agreement signed at COP21 in Paris in December 2015, cemented this realisation as a global agenda. And given cities are now projected to house 70% of the world’s population by 2050, they have become central to the debate which has understandably shifted to adaptation and mitigation. The work of the C40 cities and the Compact of Mayors are testament to cities recognizing the critical role they play in tackling climate change. UCCR’s breadth of perspective is a key strength, focusing on ‘the ability of cities to persist in the face of the multiple threats posed by climate change’. Today, UCCR embraces the capacity of cities to prepare for and withstand sudden shocks familiar from disaster risk reduction thinking. It also focuses the need to adapt progressively as stresses accumulate. Finally, it’s able to identify the opportunities pressures provide to think differently, adopt new strategies and transform. The most exciting part about UCCR’s momentum is its role as a paradigm shift, one that takes us beyond ‘development as usual’. Development has typically focused on economic growth and prosperity, at the expense of social inclusion or sustainable development. UCCR inherently recognises that within a city, climate change impacts are experienced unequally, and it challenges cities to engage in collective action that benefits all. For the world’s newest and fastest growing cities, particularly across Asia, UCCR is a timely tool as they grapple with development issues. UCCR recognises that the quality of urban development and governance is the key not only to prosperity and well-being, but the ability to survive and thrive. It shows us the best path forward."

193,Beneath the surface of high performance façades,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/beneath-the-surface-of-high-performance-facades,,"Façades are the face of our buildings, but increasingly they are also the lungs and cardiovascular system, all working together to improve the health, functionality, and amenity of the building, the outside environment and the people inside. There is a general understanding that façade performances have improved significantly over the last ten years. This has been led by glass performance and often resulted in larger vision areas; improving the access to views without increasing the energy burden. It is probably less well understood however, how façades can also improve user comfort and amenity. For example, the simple use of shading devices can reduce the issue of glare, which results in reduced reliance on blinds and thus increased access to view. Or for example, how operable façades can be designed to respond to and control thermal radiant effects so that mechanical systems can be simplified. None of this means though, that a high performance façade has to be complex. It might simply be a matter of shading, fenestration design, and glass choice that achieves significant performance improvements. You might start to think that every façade is high performance, as every time someone puts high performance glazing onto a façade it seems to attract that label. But, does a low-E coat* really make a façade worthy of the high performance definition? Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. I would use that definition to describe a façade that significantly exceeds current standards and expectations for waterproofing, energy transmission, acoustics, thermal, and visual comfort. “ I also like the idea that it can do more than a normal façade. Can it ventilate the building without noise or operate responsively to occupant needs? Can it clean itself or be compostable? The answer to all of these questions by the way, is potentially yes. ” Haico Schepers Principal I also think a high performance façade should be one that provides an integrated envelope solution. By that I mean that it provides a solution that is more than mere cladding, its zone of influence extends beyond the 200mm perimeter cladding zone and into the occupied space itself, integrating it with the building performance. International Towers Sydney, Barangaroo South The façades for the International Towers Sydney were designed with very tight environmental targets. These buildings are designed to achieve on multiple performance outcomes. They use fixed external shading to minimise solar glare and load while acting as light shelves for daylight. They are tuned in slope and orientation to maximise view and minimise blind use. For the east and west façades, they include operable blinds for low angle sun conditions. This combination of outcomes was optimised for each individual panel. That is, each panel uses a specific set of shade and blind combinations to maximise daylight and view without exceeding peak thermal loads. This analysis was performed taking into account overshadowing of surrounding buildings, and as a result the shade subtly changes around the building in response to the tower’s unique microclimate. 200 George Street Another project I worked on that is a good example of a high performance façade is 200 George Street, which recently opened. This is the first closed cavity façade in Australia. What is unique about this project is that the development was able to achieve a very low solar heat gain for the curtain wall panel without using a wide cavity vented façade. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. It recognises that modern, double glazed units are so efficient in insulating against temperature that the façade cavity does not need to be ventilated to relieve this heat. The cavity is effectively dehumidified and keeps clean by an air bleed system that provides dry air into the cavity to avoid convection issues. To some degree the façade design was based on being comfortable, based on previous design learnings from projects such as the vented blinds at Darling Quarter and the dehumidification strategy of the ETFE design at Beijing Aquatic centre. These two innovations make this amazing looking façade possible. One Central Park Another favourite is One Central Park. Recently I attended an Arup global façade workshop on green façades, with a focus on quantifying the city-scale benefits of greening our buildings. There was a series of individual analysis sessions, where presentations quantified the impacts on acoustics, water quality, heat island effect, and new technologies. Also, there were several international project examples such as Bosco Verticale. Australasia was well represented with One Central Park and Woha’s PARKROYAL. Overall, I came away thinking that there was still a great opportunity to improve our cities with green infrastructure. In particular, we can improve how envelopes can enhance our semi-external spaces. Some examples of this are the heliostat at One Central Park, the natural ventilation at the new extension to High Point in Melbourne and the microclimate umbrella at Pacific Fair in the Gold Coast. * Low-e coatings have been developed to minimise the amount of ultraviolet and infrared light that can pass through glass without compromising the amount of visible light that is transmitted."
194,Realising the benefits of yet to be opened data,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/realising-benefits-of-yet-to-be-opened-data,,"Some of the largest data custodians are governments and their agencies. The value of their data is often unknown or unrealised and the process of opening data can be challenging. Arup has – and is – helping to realise the benefits of this data for governments (national, state, provincial and local), their departments, multilateral agencies, authorities, satellites, private firms and universities. Collaboration is working together for a common purpose. By working together, we can realise the benefits of all types and forms of data, even data that is yet to be opened up to public access. Three major classes of benefits we see in government open data are in informing existing policy, developing innovative new policy and opening up commercial opportunities which benefit society Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Open data can inform existing policy and government operations by identifying opportunities to improve efficiency, effectiveness or equity. A longstanding example of the use of open data is the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s weather and water datasets, which are accessible online, and used to inform everything from local engineering standards through to the direction of Australian Government drought relief packages in rural areas. The accessibility of open data to external parties enables evidence-informed feedback to government about the operation of a given policy. Open data assists to develop innovative policy by identifying new or alternative avenues for government operation. The Australian Government has attempted to foster this through facilitating ‘GovHack’ days, where policy challenges are set and volunteer teams work together to generate new and alternative programs and measures to address the challenge. The 2015 GovHack had challenges such as ‘best disaster mitigation hack’ and utilised the open data of over twenty Australian Government agencies and departments. Commercial opportunities arise from open data, and these can generate much social benefit. An example is the provision of realtime public transport data to support smart travel apps. Smart travel apps enable people to more effectively use public transport, providing greater societal benefits from active transport and better use of public resources. The developers of apps receive a commercial return. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Open data is an uncomfortable fit with government culture. Public service codes of conduct clearly debar the improper use of information, and norms of behaviour lean strongly towards risk and harm minimisation. Governments have access to privileged information and the sometimes vague process of opening data challenges deeply ingrained cultures and norms. Making use of large datasets, be they open or not, can be a practical challenge for governments and businesses. Resource and capacity constraints within their organisations can limit the uptake and use of data to inform policy and business. Furthermore, realising value from data often requires technical training and conceptual knowledge to use and interpret the results of analysis. Providing open data does not in itself result in benefits realisation. Use and analysis of data may need to be directed to generate value. GovHack days are undertaken on a volunteer basis and are resource intensive to organise. It’s vital to collaborate on open data, and yet to be opened data, in ways which address the cultural, practical and beneficial outcomes. Cultural challenges can be overcome by structuring collaboration in ways which observe privacy, confidentiality and information treatment standards. In many projects we provided advice and undertook analysis on a confidential basis on data which is yet to be opened. At times this included in situ work in client office locations. Substantial depth of technical skill and conceptual knowledge are essential elements when interrogating large datasets. When data analysis generates results, we can explain and interpret these based on conceptual and technical background to great benefit to the data custodian. When collaborating we seek to structure the project outcomes to realise the desired benefits. Often our collaboration has a particular policy challenge in mind, such as establishing best practice or prioritising investment. We use government open data as well as data which is yet to be opened. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. The opening of government data is a continuing trend. One of the key tools of governments is their position as a central node in society. Through their central position, governments absorb and access information from different sources in a multitude of ways. Using the information for public benefit, governments make evidence informed policy. Governments are resource constrained. The information received by governments far exceeds their analytical ability. The provision of open data allows parties outside of government to analyse data, to identify opportunities, trends and change. Political discourse supports open data, as demonstrated by the Cameron Government’s and Turnbull Government’s respective support and initiatives. Yet the provision and use of open data presents challenges to governments. Collaboration with skilled and technical specialists provides a way to realise the benefits of open data, as well as data that is yet to be opened."
195,The data age ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/the-data-age,,"Data. For such a small word, it’s changing our lives as profoundly as the Industrial Revolution. It’s transformed how we do old things and enabled us to do new things that were never before possible. “ The ability to gather, store, use and analyse data has spawned new industries, new jobs. It’s also seen the loss of industries, the loss of jobs. ” Dave Martin Principal Despite all these changes and transformations, losses and gains, there is one thing that has remained the same… the need to store and the need to protect. In today’s Internet-driven and data reliant business landscape, keeping data safe from harm is not only paramount, it’s more important than ever before. Any service degradation or loss of data can have a detrimental impact on productivity, brand, customer loyalty and the bottom line. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Enter the exponential growth of data centres. Our hunger for data and protecting it sees five percent of the energy we use go towards data centres. Experts predict these data centres will bypass aviation in terms of energy consumption. Storing data is not a new concept. Traditionally the popular choice was to store data in-house, on servers inside the company’s office. In the late nineties we saw the birth of modern data centres and as the need for more storage rose exponentially across the globe (with internet activity, smartphones, social media, apps), so too did the need to re-think conventional approaches to data centre infrastructure and design. While some companies still store their data in-house, we have seen in recent years a definite move to outsourcing storage to data centres. Some companies choose to rent space in a co-location facility, while others with mega storage needs are building their own centres. “ With so much more information and data needing to be stored, the question becomes – what model is right for ‘me’ taking into account potential future needs. ” Dave Martin Principal Financial services companies, for example, may want to design and build their own data centres so they can ensure that the building complies with their very specific requirements. Smaller businesses may choose to rent space in a co-location facility. Then there is the hybrid solution where there is a mix of in-house and outsourced data centres. Understanding client’s needs are key to providing the right solution. Co-location facilities are essentially a hotel for data storage. The hotel owner (aka the co-location provider) builds a facility to attract ‘hotel guests’. Such attractions include huge on-site uninterruptable power sources, closely controlled internal environmental conditions and a high level of resilience to maintain ‘uptime’. Regardless of which model, the move from in-house storage to outsourcing to a data centre is becoming more common largely due to the capital and operational cost of storing in-house as well as the need to design and install complicated infrastructure which will provide an optimal level of resilience. A typical data centre would use in excess of 10-20 times more power than a standard commercial building and internal environmental conditions within the data centre needs to be closely and constantly controlled. Factor in the need for security and uninterruptable back up power requirements and in-house data storage simply becomes unfeasible for many companies. Triggers and trends In Australasia and across APAC, the boom in new data centres has been underway for some time, driven by the growth in internet traffic and the number of connected devices. Gartner suggests that 6.4 billion connected ‘things’ will be in use in 2016, a figure that will reach 20.8 billion by 2020. Faster broadband speeds, more devices and more data will support the ongoing growth and need for data centres. With an annual revenue of US$600m and 11% growth in Australia, cloud computing is also shaping the future of data centres. Cloud data centres not only provide data storage facilities but also provide computing facilities whereby a customer can purchase specific computing ability or access to software on tap and on demand. This could be for a number of days, weeks or even just a few hours. With huge capital and operational costs at play there is a continued drive amongst data centre operators to design and install the most cost effective, efficient systems possible while maintaining levels of resilience and redundancy required to maximise uptime. Use of free-cooling, for example, is key to driving efficiency with numerous new and innovative options available while designing for staged installation of large scale plant infrastructure keeps down capital expenditure until it’s needed. There can, however, be no compromise on security and resilience – so clever engineering is a must for modern data centres. So, there is a lot to consider when storing data and as our hunger for it continues to grow, so too does the need to ensure it’s protected and housed in the most resilient, reliable, innovative, high-performance, flexible ‘hotel’ possible.

196,Facing up to the future: the City Resilience Index,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/city-resilience-index,,"The City Resilience Index is helping cities understand and measure their capacity to endure, adapt and transform. People are drawn to cities as centres of economic activity, opportunity and innovation. Today, a city’s ability to be competitive, whilst supporting the wellbeing of its citizens, can be compromised by risks from climate change to infrastructure deficit, and unplanned growth to pandemics. As one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, city resilience is now accepted as a critical urban agenda. But how can we make resilience tangible and practical for cities? How can resilience be applied by cities to build sound strategies and prioritise investments? Pioneering approaches and new competencies are required in order to adopt resilience as a positive urban development agenda. Over the past four years, with the support of The Rockefeller Foundation, Arup has developed the City Resilience Index – a new way to understand and champion resilience in cities. “ The CRI was created over three years and in consultation with a range of cities globally. It is designed with rigor, and in a way that cities everywhere will benefit from using it as a planning and decision-making tool, that can help them realize a resilience dividend from investments in their growth and the well-being of their citizens. ” Judith Rodin President, The Rockefeller Foundation, 2005-2017 A worldwide research effort The City Resilience Index is based on three years of research contributions, case studies and pilot schemes conducted in diverse cities across the world. As the map below makes clear, the City Resilience Index draws on insights from cities across the world. Arup has worked with its own experts and conducted primary research in cities that face very different local challenges. We then conducted pilot schemes in a similarly diverse range of locations to ensure the City Resilience Index is relevant, robust and globally applicable. “ The City Resilience Index is an excellent tool that highlights areas of improvement, identifies weaknesses and concentrates minds towards finding innovative ways to mitigate against risk. The international and flexible nature of the index enables a wider understanding beyond that of the usual local or national approach. ” Joe Anderson Mayor of Liverpool Evolving with threats Every city is different. Without an understanding of interdependencies and vulnerabilities, sudden shocks and chronic stresses have the potential to lead to cascading failure. Upheavals that threaten the functioning of a city can be unexpected, like freak weather or slow-moving and systemic – like economic decline. And sometimes one can suddenly reveal the other. The effect of long term stresses can take many forms. Cities where a lack of economic opportunity has allowed crime to gain a foothold; a city where falling budgets have compromised flood defences and created a lack of trust in local policing; a city where health risks lead to a mass exodus of its labour force and loss of competitiveness. The factors that contribute to city resilience are the same worldwide, although their relative importance in each city may vary. This forms the basis of the City Resilience Index.

Download A global approach Our clients, projects and multinational presence bring us into contact with the multitude of challenges that cities face. City resilience is recognised as one of the key drivers of urban development within our cities work. We are deeply committed to developing a strategic and pragmatic response to the agenda of city resilience. This is why Arup, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation, has created the City Resilience Index. It is based on three years of research and analysis into what actually constitutes resilience, based on evidence from 28 diverse cities spread across the world. The City Resilience Index is the first comprehensive tool that helps cities to understand and measure their resilience in a systematic, globally applicable way. It’s our belief that the CRI will help city stakeholders to stay future-focused, gaining much-needed clarity on relevant actions as they prioritise investments to become more resilient places . “ This ongoing research will help a city improve its parameters like infrastructure, economy, livelihood and employment, security, law and order. This programme will be included under our city’s development plan. ” Tikender Panwar Deputy Mayor of Shimla Resilience goals Our research tells us that universally there are 12 goals that each and every city should strive towards in order to achieve resilience. These are what matters most when a city faces chronic problems or sudden catastrophe. 1 of 2 The CRI provides a holistic articulation of city resilience, structured around four dimensions, 12 goals and 52 indicators that are critical to measure the resilience of our cities. “ The City Resilience Index represents an important advancement in assessing resilience, providing a new opportunity for cities, through an analysis of real data, to better assess what their resilience capabilities are. ” Michael Berkowitz President of 100 Resilient Cities, Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation 100 Resilient Cities The 100 Resilient Cities – pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, has adopted the City Resilience Framework to guide the development of City Resilience Strategies across the world.

197,Transport station design in Australia needs a major re-think ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/transport-station-design-in-australia-needs-a-major-rethink,,"Creating interchanges and making them destinations in their own right is the secret to restoring the ‘esprit’ of yesteryears stations, which in turn has a transformative effect on our communities, restoring pride, and revitalising and reigniting whole city areas. When train stations first came about, they were designed around people and the passenger experience. They were an energiser for small cities, the heart of civic life. They were meeting places and market spaces and were designed and built with a quality of aesthetic that people were proud of and wanted to protect. But then in the 1960s and 70s we turned our back on stations in favour of the car. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. “ When the volume of cars became too great for our streets, we went back to the commuter train, but this time design was all about getting the cheapest materials to minimise replacement costs when passengers damaged them. Commuter trains and stations looked and felt awful - narrow corridors and low ceilings, crappy materials, crammed with people. They had no ‘esprit’. ” Nille Juul-Sørensen Director When St Pancras in London re-opened in 2006, things changed again… for the better. It was a new way of treating a station, turning an unloved, historic rail terminus into a dynamic transport interchange and a destination in its own right – it’s an international hub for the high speed Eurostar, a commuter station, an underground station, a food marketplace, has a Michelin restaurant, is an art gallery, has a book club, and has even played host to some of the world’s biggest music stars. Over one third of the people at St Pancras each day don’t take a train. They are there to do other things. “ This was a place not too long ago that you would only visit if you wanted a stolen car quickly. The whole area has now been completely rejuvenated and the revitalised station was a major part of that transformation. ” Nille Juul-Sørensen Director The key change was an evolution of the stand-alone station from having a single purpose to having other functions which are valuable for the community. “ The station became an interchange, connecting many public transport modes and ensuring the smooth easy movement of people. The interchange became a destination. It was now integrated into the design of the broader urban fabric, rather than being just a stand-alone station. ” Kristian Winther Associate, Architecture More cities across the globe are moving away from looking at station design as functional and transport-related only, to spaces – or ‘interchange destinations’ – which combine other experiences – community gardens on unused roof’s, farmers markets, libraries, pools, gyms, doctors and civic services for the community – essentially ‘hacking’ the traditional idea of station by taking one function and doing something completely different with it. IKEA HACK: A Paris train platform was ‘hacked’ by IKEA, when they provided an opportunity to experience their new range of sofa furniture. Commuters could sit, learn and upload information via QR code. This ‘hack’ is transforming passenger experience, utilising existing technology to create a place of inspiration and engagement. Yes it’s a commercial activity, but it’s a smart idea that gives passengers a smile and changes peoples behaviour. Not one couch was shredded or graffitied during this hack. Fast forward into the future and ‘hacking’ is sure to be a top trend in interchange design, but Nille and Kristian also believe we will see more emphasis on quality, technology and groundbreaking architectural designs which help improve passenger flows. “ We will see these places being friendly spaces. Well lit, nice to be in, clean, great architecture… you don’t want to walk through a machine, you are walking through an urban space… humans appreciate beautiful spaces, buildings with interesting life, textures and so on. ” Kristian Winther Associate, Architecture The opportunities are endless. Ticketing at the train door, a reserved train seat, a chair that moulds to the passengers body, your favourite music playing. Technology can help make these things possible and it has the potential to change everything and bring with it a seamless travel experience. The other vital piece of the interchange destination jigsaw is creating a seamless experience for the passengers and also those non-passengers using these spaces. “ It shouldn’t be about making people spend longer time than they need to, it’s about enabling people to spend time because they want to. Everything should be functional, like way-finding, it should be very easy to use and people shouldn’t need to hunt for that information to find where they need to go. ” Nille Juul-Sørensen Director We need to think about the interchange as part of a bigger city system. Each piece of infrastructure should connect with others. The architecture should be more contextual and reflect the city we live in; which means different stations will be different in different cities, even in different parts of those cities. Challenges Designing transport interchanges is certainly complex, and while we are seeing these projects pop up across the world, there are several barriers – or challenges – which are preventing more rapid adoption. The biggest barrier is the mindset of governments, train companies and major operators who are restricted by the layers and layers of regulations and standards have been built up over a few hundred years of the rail industry. “ When a new idea is put forward, or questions are asked to try things differently, usually the first answer is ‘no’ because that’s the way things have always been done. It’s time to change this mindset and explore the possibilities. ” Nille Juul-Sørensen Director We have to have smarter design, offer legislative incentives and most importantly focus on quality if we are to create more vibrant, useful and integrated station spaces that have users and the community at their core and connect them with the local neighbourhood. Other factors include the current siloed approach to designing these projects, a lack of understanding as to benefits, and cost. The cost to create a destination style interchange rather than a stand alone thoroughfare is perceived to be larger at the outset, but the long-term gains are far greater and this is something that needs to be understood better. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. “ Also, different organisations or bodies own and control the various elements… the train company don’t necessarily look at the city, or the urban planners don’t look at the station ... one major thing we could do better is get these people to work on projects together rather than in silo’s. Melbourne Quarter is a good example where this has been achieved … a station has been upgraded to a destination and a massive urban development is now following. ” Kristian Winther Associate, Architecture It’s important to educate that there are added benefits for private developers. If there is a great station interchange destination next to their residential building, there will be more people and it will create a better community, better possibilities for urban development and so on."
198,Developing disaster waste management preparedness in Vanuatu,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/developing-disaster-waste-management-preparedness-in-vanuatu,,"Arup was invited by RedR Australia to accompany them on a reconnaissance trip to Vanuatu to review the work undertaken by RedR deployees in the wake of Cyclone Pam in 2015. Cyclone Pam, a category 5 cyclone, hit Vanuatu over the weekend of the 11-13 March, 2015, causing over AU$500m of damage and widespread devastation across this developing nation. I was chosen to accompany RedR Australia on the reconnaissance trip. In the wake of Cyclone Pam RedR deployed 15 staff to work in the areas of food distribution and logistics, WASH recovery projects, medical aid distribution, and general project management within the National Disaster Management Organisation (NDMO). This was the greatest number of RedR staff deployed from Australia to a single disaster response operation. “ During my visit, a consistent theme identified through discussions with many Vanuatuan and International Agencies was waste management in Vanuatu - waste management is a major challenge during business as usual, let alone in the wake of a major natural disaster. ” Joyanne Manning Resource and Waste Management Lead, Australasia With support from RedR, I have been working on a project in partnership with SUEZ Australia, and with Mandalay Technologies providing advice and guidance on disaster waste management preparedness. The goal of the project is to ensure this remote island nation is better prepared to deal with the aftermath clean up from major weather events. Arup has also provided a bursary scholarship to a final year student from Griffith University to complete her research thesis preparing a natural disaster waste management preparedness guideline. Last week, myself and Gavin Tunstall from SUEZ Australia, finally got to revisit Vanuatu. We visited Ambae Island in Penama Province, Luganville on Espiritu Santo and the capital Port Vila and met with representatives from Penama Provincial Government, Luganville Municipal Council and the Department of the Environment. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. The challenges faced outside the major centres of Port Vila, Luganville and Lénakel (Tanna) are very different. The challenges faced outside the major centres of Port Vila, Luganville and Lénakel (Tanna) are very different. Outside their major municipal centres there is absolutely no waste infrastructure. In the populated centres, there is some established waste management planning and infrastructure, but it is basic and in need of more resources and funding. Ambae Island is probably one of the most untouched by the developed world locations I have ever lived in. No sealed roads, 98% of the population has no access to power, water or sanitation, there are no port facilities, industry, and of specific interest to me, there is no waste management infrastructure. The 10,000 population who pretty much entirely survive on subsistence living burn, bury or dump their waste. But this island is developing power infrastructure, is seeking better access to water for its population and has plans to build a wharf which will mean easier importation of commodities and consumables and are desperately wanting to develop tourism. Vanuatu introduced legislation last year which now bans the burning, burying and illegal dumping of waste so to comply with this, the Province has to develop waste infrastructure. But even the first step of acquiring a site to develop a waste landfill, requires mapping and given that the vast majority of the country is unmapped this is a significant challenge. Moving forward Ambae and the other Vanuatuan Islands will become more developed. They will develop power and water and other infrastructure mainly to support tourism, resulting in more and more waste generation, and the generation of new waste streams which will all need to be managed. Luganville Municipal Council estimate that circa 65% of the municipal waste stream is organic but that still leaves a significant percentage of the waste stream that is non combustible or non compostable. The islands critically need to develop waste infrastructure to stop contamination and pollution being caused from burning, burying and illegal dumping of waste. To do this they need resources, capacity and capability, which is all lacking in the current government agencies and provinces. I'm looking forward to my continued involvement and seeking ways of influencing and convincing others to also get involved and help build capability and capacity in Vanuatu to progress the development of waste infrastructure across the islands."
199,Lessons learned in an earthquake's aftermath,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/lessons-learned-in-an-earthquakes-aftermath,,"Disasters are never entirely natural; the risks inherent in our environment can be amplified or diminished by any number of factors, from culture to politics and economics. Similarly, building back effectively after events like hurricanes and earthquakes is never a simple construction exercise. For engineers working in disaster relief, a strong understanding of the local context and an ability to collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders is as important as technical prowess. For two Arup staff members who traveled to Ecuador in the wake of April’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake, these lessons were abundantly clear. Part of a UK-government-backed team of seismic experts, Anna Pavan from our Madrid office and Francisco Pavia from our Bogotá office spent 10 days assisting the Ecuadorian military’s relief efforts. Most of their work focused on Pedernales, one of the cities hit hardest by the quake. I spoke with Anna and Francisco to learn more. Describe what you saw when you got to Ecuador Francisco: When we first arrived in Quito, there was a very large caravan of trucks, 20 or 30, with a convoy of police and volunteers collecting supplies to take to the coast. But that was the only impression I had of any damage. In Quito everything was normal. We left for Pedernales as part of a convoy with the British, American, and Canadian ambassadors. Along the road there wasn’t much damage either. It wasn’t until just outside Pedernales, about a four-hour drive from Quito, that we saw people camping along the road. Anna: There was a lot of control; people were organized. The military was going from tent to tent distributing supplies, so people were calm and there was order. Francisco: The first day we were able to walk around the town and contact the military engineers. They were happy to have us there — we were the only technical team deployed in Pedernales at that time. I’ve read that up to 70% of the buildings in Pedernales were destroyed. Why did it suffer more than other parts of the country? Francisco: It’s difficult to know for sure. Other towns were closer to the epicenter, and other areas surrounding Pedernales were better-off. It is confusing. For starters, the fact that it’s next to the ocean has something to do with it — the plate boundary is there, in between the ocean and the continent. Anna: The local people blamed the collapsed buildings a lot on materials: concrete made with sea sand and saltwater. In my opinion, Pedernales suffered a lot because of its building typologies. It’s a fairly large tourist town with many hotels and multistory office buildings Quite a few of the buildings are made with poor-quality concrete. There is a definite lack of seismic detailing. By contrast, the areas outside Pedernales that Francisco mentioned — for example, the village where we were staying at night — are not tourist areas; these are fishing villages. Buildings out there have mainly one story, maximum two stories, and many of the houses are timber, which behaved particularly well in the earthquake. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Francisco: Pedernales, from my impression, has developed within the last two or three decades. Some buildings have proper seismic designs, but not a lot. Often in Latin America people build a foundation for a one- or two-story building but then keep building upwards, with the columns remaining the same size. The result is very dangerous. Anna: In terms of what we might have left people with, I hope it’s the idea that simple buildings might be safer. If you don’t have any seismic design knowledge and you’re going to build your own house, simple is better. That is likely why some of the other towns did not see as much damage as Pedernales. Your assignment was to assess the local building stock for damage after the earthquake. Can you describe what you found? Was it different from what you expected? Francisco: A lot of buildings that I saw were in good shape structurally and could be repaired. A lot of people would think otherwise if they saw a lot of walls down and things like that, but I learned you have to look beyond that to the structure — what’s actually supporting the building, in other words. The problem is that in an earthquake badly designed nonstructural items such as infill walls can be deadly. A good example is the town hall, the first building that we assessed in Pedernales. We found out that it wasn’t as bad structurally as people were saying, but there was a discussion happening about whether to demolish it, since other buildings nearby collapsed. We realized that stairs and some columns had obviously suffered, but ultimately they resisted and damage was limited to nonstructural walls. Anna: Yes, as Francisco said, I learned to look at things with a different eye. If you assess a building that is very badly damaged, you really have to focus on where the damage actually is. Reconstruction should learn from and begin with the buildings that structurally withstood one of the strongest earthquakes the earth has experienced in the recent past. In Pedernales, we found that for the big buildings, the important cultural buildings, the damage was more cosmetic — it wasn’t affecting the structures. Francisco and Anna meeting with military representative Francisco: We worked with the military to help balance the need to demolish unsafe buildings with the need to recover things for the community. For instance, the church in the main plaza. The damage was pretty bad — thankfully no one was inside when the earthquake occurred — but structurally it could be saved, actually. So we had the chance to explain this to the army, which was our main stakeholder. Partly because of this we prioritized assessments of public buildings, although we did look at some houses and shops, especially if people approached us and asked us for help. Anna: Some of the most important assessments happened when a group of engineers from the army came with us inside the buildings. We were showing them how we were doing the assessments, and day by day we started developing relationships, not just with them but other stakeholders. So we started sharing our knowledge with everyone. “ If you don’t have any seismic design knowledge and you’re going to build your own house, simple is better. ” Anna Pavan Senior Engineer Detail of U.S. Geological Survey map showing earthquake epicenter (starred) north of Pedernales How successful do you think the mission was? Anna: Overall I think it was successful. We were able to engage with the local community, to gain their trust, and at the same time propose a new methodology. We understood their needs and we worked alongside them. We were able to provide much-needed technical help to start a very long reconstruction process. Francisco: Before we got there I thought it was going to be hard to get in touch with local authorities and even more difficult to give technical advice and really be heard and trusted. But it was the opposite. Everyone was very thankful and welcoming. The chief of engineers for the army asked us to join him for a meeting in front of the town hall. They wanted to explain to local authorities and people that the building did not need to be demolished, and he wanted us as an expert second opinion for the public to see. So I would also say the mission was very successful. Even though the impact we had is obviously very small in the context of all the need — we just did a couple dozen assessments — it soon became clear that our main purpose was not to do a lot of assessments but to share a way of thinking in order for them to do this work on their own. This is probably the best learning opportunity that I’ve had as an engineer. Anna: Yes, definitely. We were not just sharing our knowledge; we gained a huge amount of experience. It is important to see right in front of you the effects of bad design, of not taking care with seismic detailing. That way we see how important our work is. “ Our main purpose was not to do a lot of assessments but to share a way of thinking in order for them to do this work on their own. ” 1 of 2 Nearly collapsed building in Ecuador The work Francisco and I started there continues on a daily basis. We’re still in contact with pretty much everybody we met there. I don’t know what will happen in the future, but there is still a lot of opportunity for learning and a lot that we can do to help."
200,Anticipating the effects of the sharing economy ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/anticipating-the-effects-of-the-sharing-economy,,"I believe we should start to consider the additional side-effects that the ‘sharing economy’ is having on cities. Across the world, Airbnb has transformed hundreds of thousands of private residential rooms into short-term alternatives to the traditional hotel. And Uber has made hailing a taxi simple and cheap, adding massive additional supply of cabs to streets in hundreds of cities. These businesses quickly scale up as they provide innovative new consumer services - but often have longer-term positive and negative effects on city life. These sharing economy businesses are able to monetise spare capacity in all sorts of contexts, often with reduced tax exposure, meaning that the consumer receives a great service at a compelling price. The person-to-person nature of the sharing economy also creates opportunities for a personalised service, which many people find more satisfying than dealing with larger businesses. The second order effects are now also starting to emerge - and it’s these that may have major policy implications for cities. In property, Airbnb is starting to open up new areas of cities, often previously unknown to tourists, accelerating the effects of gentrification. And there is some evidence (from San Francisco in particular) that a property’s potential value on Airbnb is starting to affect overall housing costs. People are beginning to take account of the income value of an asset in the sharing economy when they consider the price that they are willing to pay for it. This is having three effects. Firstly, previously unwanted assets that might have been sold on, or disposed of, may be retained by those that own them (“why sell that car, if I can lease it out using easycarclub?”), meaning that limited assets may be hoarded by a smaller group of people. Secondly, the factoring in of the sharing economy value in a sales price will mean that in future the assets would no longer be defined as “spare” – they would become longer-term financial investments that would require recouping. This suggests that the sharing economy is becoming a little bit more like the real economy – and not shared at all. And thirdly, people are now buying assets with the intention of sharing – meaning that the factoring in of value will reinforce price growth, especially in property in desirable cities, worsening further the supply of affordable housing. In some cases, this has been made worse by properties being taken permanently away from the mainstream housing market, to be used for short holiday lets only. In transport, Uber and Lyft are also beginning to change the face of transport demand. In Los Angeles, rideshare apps have already been cited as a factor in declining demand for public transport services, and night time transport services are particularly vulnerable. If the city authorities choose to match levels of service to demand, this could produce some cost savings, but will of course also impact on individuals that depend on that service. If this trend is repeated elsewhere it could have implications for a city’s planned transport expansions – particularly London’s planned extension to the Underground system’s hours of operation to 24 hours. It may also lead to land use changes as public transport “deserts” become more desirable. But access to cheaper, more accessible, door-to-door transport options may also help social inclusion among older, and mobility impaired people. We are dealing with economic effects that have the capacity to cascade, creating social effects as they play out. But we shouldn’t fear these changes. Instead, the role of designers and policy advisors should be to help their clients look ahead, plan their response and adapt positively to these emerging patterns of behaviour and use. We could change the physical shape of our cities to embrace the future – so that apartments are partially designed according to their value on Airbnb. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on these long-term effects, and how they can be planned for."
201,Buildings must promote healthy communities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/buildings-must-promote-healthy-communities,,"As place-makers we have to contend with and resolve often competing priorities when designing a building. Even working with an enlightened approach it’s easy to miss the social dimension, the impact that the finished project will have on the way people interact inside and outside it. I believe we have a duty to factor in this all-important consideration if we’re to create buildings that genuinely lead to healthy cities. The equation could be simplified to this: buildings that promote social interaction and communication are ones that support healthy lives, creating areas where people thrive. A building might not itself speak but it still has a role to play in promoting conversation and socialisation in its neighbourhood. One metric of a well-integrated society is the access everyone has to the shared features of a city, from its transport networks, to entertainment venues, parks and recreation facilities. But accessibility is often treated as a box ticking exercise, left to the end of a project. Wayfinding is also often considered late in the project cycle, leaving less time for a thoughtful, context-sensitive approach (much less anything innovative). But by moving both of these aspects of design to the beginning of the project process we could stimulate better health and communication outcomes, for a more diverse range of the population, creating mobility possibilities for all, including disabled people and other people who are often excluded. Hong Kong’s MTR underground train system dates back to the early twentieth century and was not easy to navigate for disabled people (including blind and partially sighted people). In the 1990s MTR decided to solve this problem in a joined-up way, adding tactile cues for blind and partially sighted people, and providing other inclusive features to the entire network. To take that thinking further, perhaps station navigation in future could be designed to work in a tactile way for all users, right from the outset. Disney World Resort is often cited for its pioneering approach to wayfinding, a vital feature for those navigating their way across the 40 square mile theme park. But such large-scale, top-down projects are rare. Our role as engineers on more typically scaled projects is to remind smaller clients to understand the communication and health implications their commission might involve. Beyond wayfinding there are other, innovative ways that we might design sensory interventions in order to improve public spaces and promote social interaction. Since the 1990s there have repeatedly been successful experiments piping classical music into public spaces to discourage anti-social behaviour. And in 2012, in a highly context-responsive design solution, a local energy company in northern Sweden installed light therapy panels in 26 bus shelters to offset seasonally affective disorder in passengers during the long months of darkness. These examples emphasise the value of considering how the built environment truly affects the lives of its users. I believe it’s time to embed this thinking in all we do."
202,Future libraries: what could they be?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/future-libraries-what-could-they-be,,"Libraries are going through a renaissance, both in terms of the social infrastructure they provide and the diversification of services and experiences offered. In corporate environments they are playing an increased role in the provision of collaborative workspace and innovation. In communities, they are evolving into hubs for education, health, entertainment and work. These trends reflect increased efforts by libraries across a range of sectors to bring people back into their physical spaces. This has resulted in an increase in tangible experiences, including maker spaces and immersive activities, particularly in public libraries. In addition to changing spatial layout and programmes, the digital environment is key. The “walls” of a library continue to expand beyond the physical space, with an increase in online resources, social media, crowdsourcing and mobile services having an impact on how collections are accessed online and on the go.

203,Sydney a smart city?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/sydney-a-smart-city,,"Sydney has a great opportunity to transform itself into a smart city in the coming years. During my recent visit to Australia I attended Arup’s first Shaping our City forum, where we looked at where Sydney is up to and the challenges it’s facing. I met people from government agencies, local council, and academia all working to make the best use of technology and data to make a more liveable, efficient and greener city. Sydney has the chance to get on a really steep trajectory over the next few years. One thing to already be excited by is that when I travel from city to city to discuss the potential of these advances I’m often met with the request to lower the targets in the short-term, in Sydney the attitude was to expand and increase the targets! While that is the case, my advice to the city’s leaders is to be realistic about what you want to achieve in the next 12 months, but to be much more ambitious than you currently are for the next five years – the medium-term future is often under-imagined. And as Sydney goes down this path, the political leaders need to think about making sure all the data they collect enhances and doesn’t detract from the lives and rights of its citizens. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. All over the world, civic leaders are thinking about what it means to be a smart city. When I use that term, it encapsulates all the tools that cities are using, trends like social media, the Internet of Things (internet connected devices) and data analytics in five main areas. “ All over the world, civic leaders are thinking about what it means to be a smart city. ” Volker Buscher Chief Data Officer When I use that term, it encapsulates all the tools that cities are using, trends like social media, the Internet of Things (internet connected devices) and data analytics in five main areas. These are: Economic growth Employing all this technology in a city actually creates jobs and growth. This is being recognised in places like London, where the finance sector has traditionally been the main driver of employment. As digital capabilities increase, the city’s mayor is now considering whether the tech sector should be the next area to grow strategically. Understanding city constraints Using the data to understand the functional constraints cities suffer and how to improve them, such as water use or transport. For instance, in Hong Kong’s New Town development there’s no room for cars, so authorities are using smart ticketing and payment systems and providing consumers with real-time information to make the public transport system more efficient and to encourage people to use it. This taps into a global change in attitude among young people, who no longer aspire to own a car, but instead want mobility as a service. Sydney is heading in a similar direction with its Opal card. Environmental constraints We can also use resources to measure and optimise our consumption of resources and the amount of pollution we produce. We will not be able to decouple increasing resource consumption from the economic and population growth in cities without using technology. The social and care agenda It’s not just the young, mobile and highly skilled worker who can tap into the smart city. For instance, technology could help someone with early stage dementia stay in their home for another year by coordinating care and keeping them connected to sources of help. Or it could help organise a car pool so a single parent could do the weekly shopping in a single outing. Political engagement Citizens have access to an unprecedented amount of data about their city and their place in it. On top of that social media means they can engage with the political leaders of a city like never before. For instance, people can now measure the air and water quality where they live rather than relying on the city for the information, or organise a huge online campaign about the closure of a small suburban fire station. These five areas all create and rely on a huge amount of data about the city and its citizens and this is something cities need to think about. The big issue that his hanging over the development of Sydney as a smart city – and indeed of any city that aspires to this – is what we call the humane city. We need to avoid the mistake that city leaders all round the world made 40 or 50 years when they put up high rise towers made of concrete and steel that looked like innovation but weren’t actually very good to live in. We need to avoid building the equivalent of steel and concrete towers of data that instead of enhancing citizens’ lives actually end up detracting from it. The ubiquitous nature of the smart city will create data and transparency around an individual’s life that currently the individual doesn’t have control over because the data is owned and managed by others. Cities will have to develop a well thought out around what ethical or humane values for the digital city that deals with inclusiveness, privacy and trust. “ Often it’s the context in which the data is used that can create problems. ” Volker Buscher Chief Data Officer For instance, no one wants information about how many times they go to the gym or what sort of food they eat to be revealed to their insurance company without their permission. Or if your fridge tells you that you’ve purchased too many fatty foods and you shouldn’t have that second beer, that’s a message you probably don’t want to get from your home appliances, however well meaning. But if your fridge goes through your recent supermarket purchases and sends you a mobile phone alert that one product contains peanuts then that’s a service you’d be very grateful for if you have a child with a nut allergy. The humane city is about finding the right balance between privacy and trust and your own security, and a better articulation of what a citizen perceives as valuable to them We must remember that the city is owned by its citizens, they’re not employees. The smart city has to deliver its citizen experience or a human experience on their terms that they will want to be a part of. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch.

Just as when the global financial crisis erupted, citizens didn’t blame the banks but blamed politicians for not properly regulating the banks, politicians will be blamed for the misuse of data even if it’s by private companies. But it’s not an insurmountable problem. It’s just one that Sydney’s leaders need to be aware of and consider as they go down the path of becoming a smart city."
204,Creating the flowerpots of tomorrow: the secret to playing at the edge of inspiration,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/creating-the-flowerpots-of-tomorrow-the-secret-to-playing-at-the-edge-of-inspiration,,"Upon first glance, the escalator and reinforced concrete have nothing in common at all. But when we dig a little deeper into how those products came to be, the similarity comes down to the people behind the ideas and the thinking which not only pushed boundaries in their approach to the design, but also in the approach to the broader applications. Throughout history some of the most exciting design work has occurred at the intersection of two or more industries or disciplines. The escalator was originally conceived as a Coney Island amusement ride. Reinforced concrete came about when a gardener was attempting to develop a stronger flowerpot. When the idea was ‘borrowed’ by the engineering and construction industry, it revolutionised the building process. It’s this ‘borrowing’ of ideas, the cross pollination of skills, and a desire to push boundaries that are inherent in redefining what is possible. Design, in particular engineering design, can be a very sequential process. It is a logical rational process of steps which take you through establishing a brief, generating options, testing and assessing these and finally providing a result – a design solution. That process, although valid, provides little opportunity for inspiration, creativity and innovation. It can even impede designers from thinking more broadly or incorporate global trends and new technologies. Breaking this sequential approach, which typically engineers and consultants can fall into, is only possible when we encourage and provide the freedom to explore the boundaries of ideas. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. “ To allow the design thinking to be broad, we need to play at the edges – explore and be receptive, work in areas that are new and push into those boundaries. We need to step into what some engineers would call a ‘chaotic’ zone – a space where exploration of ideas is not inhibited. We also need time to step away and let ideas incubate – allowing space for inspiration. Highly rational and objective processes are applied later in the assessment of these ideas. ” Joseph Correnza Principal It may be an oxymoron, but logic and ‘chaos’ can be a happy marriage. By balancing the two, we break the sequential design process and allow creativity and innovation to seep in to the solutions we bring to each of our challenges and projects. Engineers are trained to be logical, direct and objective. We aren’t trained in the art of open exploration, and the idea that it’s possible to work in both spheres is an idea that is uncomfortable with many. But doing both is possible and some of the most exceptional engineers throughout history have done exactly that. 1 of 2 The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain From the Sydney Opera House and the National Assembly for Wales, to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, China’s Watercube, High Speed Rail and Stonecutters Bridge, we have seen ‘jewels of ideas’ which have transformed the way problems are defined and solutions born. The resolution of geometry around the Sydney Opera House shells was groundbreaking. Developing ideas that provided a solution to a highly complex form that was logical, rational, mathematically definable and hence buildable was a challenge overcome by an exploration of ideas generated from a state of immersion that tested the norm and entertained the ‘incredible’. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Some of our most ingenious ideas however don’t just come from iconic projects. Often it’s a less obvious detail within a project which when unlocked creates excitement and can have far reaching impact. Ideas that generate elegant solutions such as fatigue resistant connections on the Melbourne Star Observation, or redefining the underpass and alignment of the Springvale Road and Rail Grade Separation, or resolving the complex springing geometry of the shell structures at AAMI Park. Unique challenges cannot be solved innovatively by following predefined deemed-to-comply approaches. They are resolved through clever innovative thinking around how to apply engineering principles to challenges, be it a buildability issue, or a macro geometric issue or the fabrication of a building component. At the Bodegas Protos winery in Spain with Richard Stirk Harbour + Partners, changing our design approach led us to essentially fitting a ‘square peg into a round hole’, or in this case marrying two opposing forms of geometry – an efficient parabolic structure supporting a repetitive semi-circular barrel vault roof. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. The problem of marrying the two types of geometry stumped designers for months, however by exploring ideas uninhibited and collaboratively we unlocked what seems now an obvious but very powerful simple idea – divorce the geometries by offsetting one from the other. In hindsight, some of the best solutions seem simple and obvious. Elegance in design is usually uncomplicated, clear and not convoluted. Achieving apparent simplicity can however be the result of a hidden long process, pushing and testing ideas. Icons/Social/Facebook Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/LinkedIn Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/Twitter Created with Sketch. Icons/Social/More Created with Sketch. Arup engineers resolved the complex springing geometry of the shell structures at AAMI Park, Melbourne. The value of unlocking any design challenge can be directly tangible and indirectly far-reaching. Reduction in costs and construction time are usually obvious, however wider ramifications on those who use the facilities, or how amenity is improved for the wider community can be less obvious but equally if not more important for the long term sustainable future of our cities. Once you’ve unlocked a solution a new benchmark is created for doing things better in the future. Good thinkers are found in all disciplines and industries. Learning from each other is fundamental in pushing design thinking. If you work in a uni-disciplinary mindset you don’t get that cross fertilisation of ideas that can occur between different parties, and that’s why encouraging a broad variety of disciplines to participate in design thinking is so important. We see boundaries being pushed every day by different industries – from 3D printing of componentry to use of new material technologies. The aeronautical and automobile industries are using tools and technologies, which can also be applicable to the design and engineering construction industry. These include advanced virtual modelling and direct component manufacture, to optimisation using advanced computational fluid dynamics for air-flow modelling. We are already sharing innovations across these industries and look to cleverly apply these to our design thinking. On the Springvale Road and Rail Grade Separation project we saw how innovations in component manufacturing contributed to an overall construction programme reduction and consequently cost savings of tens of millions of dollars for the client. Design thinking that incorporates collaboration, sharing and across disciplines and industries will improve how we design, integrate and experience our cities. Across our industry we are in danger of our design process being degenerated as commoditisation of engineering becomes more prevalent. The outcome will be a process that encourages uninspired thinking with equally uninspiring outcomes. Exploring at the boundaries of what is possible in terms of design, sustainability, innovation and technology is the smartest way to continue to improve and shape our projects which will ultimately challenge the spaces we occupy within the cities we experience, as a community and as individuals."

206,A collective vision for the northern powerhouse ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/a-collective-vision-for-the-northern-powerhouse,,"I believe the UK’s Northern Powerhouse is about more than economic growth and transport links. This is not to underestimate the additional output that might be created through a networked economy – offering larger markets, wider recruitment pools and better business linkages. But the concept of a collaborative system of cities, from Liverpool to Hull, and from Newcastle to Sheffield, will only become real when ordinary people can understand how it will touch their lives. We might for example imagine a graduate who now sees a career ladder in the North not just for herself but also her partner. Or an elderly person who now has easier access to clinical centres of excellence across this wider network of cities. By building up a similar picture for other imaginary characters in their working and living environments, it is possible to identify the type of policy levers necessary to make a real change to their quality of life, whether this be greater flexibility to tailor the school curriculum, greater mobility within the public rented housing operating across wider areas, or an Oyster travel card for the North. This type of thought experiment illustrates the benefits of thinking much longer term than policy makers and politicians are used to doing. It also reveals that there are many interrelated factors, and that the current preoccupation with improving transport connectivity is just one part of the equation, albeit a very important first step. There are a whole range of foresighting techniques that could have an important role in developing a collective vision for the North. Is this a role for the future Metro Mayors working in partnership? Another way to make the concept real, is to demonstrate the successes that have been achieved in comparable areas through working together. For example, the vast Ruhr conurbation, previously better known as the industrial powerhouse of Germany, has been transformed through sustained physical and cultural regeneration, and now hosts a range of international arts festivals hosted in its different (linked) cities. In a different context, Copenhagen and Malmo have achieved faster economic output than their respective nations (Denmark and Sweden) through sharing their physical assets, integrating their labour markets, and developing a life sciences cluster jointly. This has been achieved within 25 years of the original transport catalyst - the Oresund bridge/tunnel - that linked the two cities for the first time across the Baltic Sea. What parallels are there for joint working between say Manchester and Leeds? To my mind, the next major challenge for the Northern Powerhouse is about changing mindsets. This will involve all sectors, including politicians, public officials, businesses and universities, in seeking to imagine what success might look like for ordinary people, as well as for the Exchequer. This new image of the North will then need to be communicated both internally and externally. This will be crucial to attracting and retaining talent, and to attracting new investment of all kinds. Am I right to think that the Northern Powerhouse must be more than a technocratic exercise? If so, how can we as planners and built environment professionals assist?"
207,Designing buildings for the future ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/design-buildings-for-the-future,,"Cities across the globe are facing increasing demand on resources – resources they need to function. However, technology is playing an important role providing more efficient systems that reduce the impact of the built environment. For example, there has been a massive change in lighting: moving from tungsten bulbs to LEDs, something which has generated considerable energy and cost savings. These lamps are reasonably easy to install as the existing electrical supply systems can be used. We design buildings with lifetimes that far exceed the speed of change of the technology used to service them. When engineering a new building, as well as considering what technology is available now, we should also consider how the development of technology might result in new solutions that could be retrofitted within the lifetime of that building. As engineers, we need to keep an eye on new advances in technology. Sometimes we encounter a new technology that may not be immediately suitable. This might be due to its readiness, its cost or the client’s perception of risk. (Many clients do not want to be the first to adopt new solutions.) The ease of retrofitting a new technology is often a barrier to its adoption in existing buildings but with some forethought there can be simple and cost-effective ways to accommodate it. One example is the increasing demand for potable water in cities. By 2050, it’s predicted that London will to need to find an additional 500 million litres of water each day and that water charges will continue to rise. One technological solution would be to reuse non-potable water such as rainwater and greywater for purposes that do not require high-quality water. However, long payback periods make these systems unattractive for now. One barrier to the adoption of water reuse systems will be the complexity of retrofitting them to existing buildings. For buildings under construction today, it’s possible to include infrastructure such as non-potable water pipework routing, and set aside space for treatment and storage equipment at a much lower cost than retrofitting non-potable water systems at a later stage. As water becomes more expensive and water resources become scarcer, foresight will allow us to have buildings ready to accept these systems in a cost-effective way. This is already happening in the desert city of Tucson, USA, where all new housing was effectively mandated to include provision for future greywater re-use and more recently in San Francisco, USA. We need to consider low-cost ways to enable easy retrofitting of new technology that can be reasonably anticipated but may not be ready yet, allowing buildings to be ‘fitted for but not yet fitted with’. By giving thought to future-proofing our buildings we will make our cities more resilient."
208,Stations: design them for new mobility ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/stations-design-them-for-new-mobility,,"There’s plenty of excitement building about self-driving cars, but how will they change the way we use public transport? What does it mean for our train, bus and coach stations? I don’t think we’ve given enough thought to this yet. I think our approach to planning stations needs a revamp to cope with the changing mobility mix. Station environs – especially their forecourts – must be designed and constructed to match what we expect the future of transport to be. Park-and-ride facilities are probably the clearest example of spaces that need rethinking. At the moment, station car parks are very common in North America and Australia. Frequently, they are at-grade and constructed to significant scale. And, they often get located in prime positions adjacent to the stations. They’re popular because they’re a relatively quick way for planners to justify investment in transit. It’s expected that commuters especially will drive to the station, park their car there for the day and take a train or bus to their destination. It’s also considered a good way to make use of land around stations owned by government with relatively little upfront investment. Now imagine how this might work in a world where autonomous vehicles (AVs) are more common than ordinary cars. AVs won’t park all day at the station – they’ll be off on their next journey. So our stations will need far fewer parking spaces but much more room for vehicles to pick up and set down passengers. Also, we need to appreciate that mobility patterns are changing beyond the emergence of AVs, with new mobility partnerships foreshadowing things like rideshares. These too, are likely to demand higher turnover kerbside space rather than long-term parking bays. We need proper transition plans for land that’s currently reserved for park-and-ride facilities. We cannot just leave it paved in apparent perpetuity given the opportunity it offers for tying urban development and transit stations together. This means making sure station precinct plans are adaptable, parking stations are modular and defining clear transition plans. Ideally, transition funding streams will be defined as well and these will be written into policy. I’m sometimes asked whether I think public transport will die out altogether following AVs and other emergent forms of mobility entering the mainstream. I don’t believe it will. Some people may swap their overall journeys to AVs, and I think we’ll see more car sharing systems like Uber’s uberHOP service that also cater to longer trips to employment centres. But I’m convinced that mass, fixed-line transit will remain vital for cities because of the volume of passengers that these serve. They are also efficient spatially along key corridors and provide land development with anchor-points. I think AVs and car-sharing services will become another way of getting to the station. So efficient access to transit stations will become ever more important as populations grow and urbanise. It’s time to re-model our stations so they’re ready for the future."
209,Human interaction in smart city design ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/human-interaction-in-smart-city-design,,"Cities are our future. Urban populations are growing globally and cities are the logical answer to using land and resources in a sustainable manner. ‘Smart cities’ is now a widely used term, highlighting the role technology can play in solving these land, resource and related urban development challenges. Whilst I do believe that technology, however unpredictable, will lead to more efficient cities, we must ensure that the human dimension is not lost in this quest. As we inch ever closer to the technological singularity we mustn’t ignore the impact technology has on human interaction. We must retain the value that public space has traditionally had in our cities. For much of the past 20 years or so people across the globe have been busy reclaiming public space back from the car – the technological innovation that largely shaped cities in the 20th century. Now we find ourselves in an era where smart cities, open data and the internet of things are set to transform and shape city building in the 21st century – this time we must ensure that humans are central to our city building efforts. Many Thoughts articles identify the value of space to human interaction and the role of grit and chance in making cities attractive. But in a world in which ‘smart’ is the buzz word and efficiency is (rightly) a principle to strive for, we run the risk of losing the opportunity for real social encounters. Humans are ultimately social animals that have evolved from living in small groups to now living in ever larger and connected cities. Our city streets and squares are spaces for human interaction, and as Jan Gehl and other urban thinkers note are integral to the quality and livability of any city. There is a growing body of research that supports this hypothesis and the negative impact that social media has on our mental wellbeing. The enthusiasts for smart city initiatives often also point to the potential to foster innovation, bringing together new technological possibilities by blending data-sets and networks. But innovative thoughts don’t thrive in isolation. Innovation often requires shared spaces and chance encounters but apps like FourSquare and Citymapper are eroding serendipity from our city experiences. These rational algorithms reduce public space’s role as a theatre of chance encounters. I believe that space for human interaction must become a key objective and measure in the development of smart cities. There is an opportunity to reinvent the market square or village green as a place where humans interact with big data, the internet of things and most importantly other humans to facilitate innovation. Without real physical and social interaction it’s hard to see how these valuable-human “collisions” (as Zappos.com CEO Tony Hsieh calls them) will still take place. We as makers of cities must therefore ensure that a brave new world does not deprive but encourages its residents to retain that messiness that fosters chance encounters and real social interaction."
210,Invest in social capital ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/invest-in-social-capital,,"I think that as designers we should challenge our clients to include more civic amenities in projects. Why? Because I believe that investing in social capital creates a self-sustaining cycle of urban improvement. Urban populations are becoming increasingly diverse and transitory. Our connection to our immediate surroundings is weakening as we evolve into citizens of our private virtual worlds, becoming only passive denizens of the places we live in. The rich and the powerful, developers and investors can take advantage of the resulting civic voids, staking claims of ownership and privilege – think of gated communities, or the ‘anti-homeless’ spikes seen in London, for example. Many new developments do include spaces for socialising, but only in the form of cafes or shopping centres, where you’re not welcome unless you’re there to spend money. Everyone else feels less and less that the city is theirs to shape and take care of, and so they then see fewer reasons to engage with its upkeep or betterment. But by including public spaces and amenities that are open to all in private projects, you can encourage a sense of shared civic agency. As more people feel they have a place in their city, they start to feel they have a say in their city. This self-sustaining cycle of civic pride and engagement can transform a city, once people start looking at urban development as something that happens for them rather than in spite of them. As designers, I believe we can help to kick-start that cycle by reminding or convincing our clients when we see an opportunity for a civic-minded intervention in their project. It’s a win-win situation because the additional monetary costs are offset by the positive externalities of a better reputation, happier neighbours, and a sense of pride in the places we live. For the developer, there’s the opportunity to benefit from an enhanced reputation. On a recent study tour to Copenhagen involving three of Arup’s European offices, I was surprised to see how a government initiative to turn the city into one of the world’s most liveable had morphed into a full-blown urban phenomenon with strong support from the private sector. Copenhagen’s quality of life is famous all over the world, but we learned that it goes way beyond cycle lanes and public swimming baths in the harbour. We saw countless private projects that had integrated public amenities for the benefit of local communities – and entirely at their own cost: climbing walls on transformer stations; seating areas on the roofs of office buildings; and even a public ski slope on top of a power plant! The pride Copenhageners have in their city felt tangible, and the way they treated these amenities was striking. It was clearly as much a result of the local government’s policies as of the mutual trust between the citizens and the private enterprise providing them; they treat these facilities well because they feel they are also theirs. Their profusion seems to have begun a battle, as developers race to out-do each other to give more back to the community. I think this is a refreshing approach and one that we should persuade our clients is in their best interests too."
211,Urban planning needs a new direction ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/urban-planning-needs-a-new-direction,,"It’s time to reconsider all our assumptions about urban planning. It’s my belief that the urban planning process needs a new, overarching direction if it’s going to solve the problems we face now and those we’ll face in the future. Challenges such as climate change, resource depletion and our rapidly expanding population can’t be met through existing planning approaches. For instance, in my opinion, current urban planning systems don’t give adequate consideration to the end-users of the future. Too often they focus on meeting short-term objectives, and they’re often driven by political and commercial requirements rather than the needs of citizens 20 or 30 years from now. Planning isn’t just about just providing the right buildings. It’s also about enabling the flow of people and goods and ensuring everyone has access to water, drainage and sanitation, as well as security. A good planning system also makes the most of advances in technology, such as smart cities, and builds in social resilience. Smart Green Resilient (SGR) thinking factors in non-tangible systems such as governance and studies their interaction with tangible systems like infrastructure, utilities and buildings. In this way we can combine multiple objectives into a single, clear planning objective. SGR links human factors, smart city principles, sustainable development and resilience together to make the most of our resources and find the optimum solution. Take the tsunami that damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant on Japan’s east coast, for example. Nuclear power is often viewed as a ‘green’ solution to our energy needs because it generates far less carbon dioxide emissions than a gas, oil or coal-fired power station. But in the face of a tsunami, a nuclear plant was not resilient. So what’s the best way to make cities green and resilient? An SGR approach can answer this question. It’s an approach that’s already being used to develop new cities and improve existing ones. For example, in Taoyuan, Taiwan, the government wanted to create an ‘aerotropolis’ – a regional economic hub centred on the airport. This new airport-centric city had to be sustainable, support innovative industries, maintain its own cultural and scenic identity, and conform with existing land use. By turning the usual planning model for this kind of development on its head and using SGR to address a larger context in a continuous landscape, the project team was able to make the best use of public investment. Compared with a traditional approach, SGR thinking can realise the full social and economic potential of the area; conserve its waterways; improve the capacity of the transport network and even improve the health and wellbeing of people living in the area. I believe that an SGR approach to urban planning holds the key to developing sustainable, technologically advanced cities that work for all their inhabitants. It’s time we applied this kind of holistic architecture to move urban planning into the 21st century."
212,Stations in the city  – How are transport hubs evolving to meet local needs?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-and-stations,,"Train stations were places of wonder in the 19th century. The buildings, like the trains within, symbolised technological progress and economic power. These ‘palaces’ of the industrial age were awe-inspiring in their sheer size, dramatic in architecture and feats of engineering. St Pancras Station in London was one such example and on its completion in 1868, was the largest enclosed space in the world. This has allowed it to be remodeled into today’s spectacular transport hub. By the second half of the 20th century, with car travel on the rise, train stations in many parts of the world lost prominence as cities planned for greater road use – undermining the prestige of rail travel. Now, as passenger numbers increase, rail is playing a central role in urban life; the economic and cultural importance of stations is increasing. A need for high-quality, beautiful, yet flexible stations, integrated into their place in the city has emerged. Investment programmes have modernised and expanded many stations across Europe and North America. Arnhem Central Station is one example: dating back to 1845, the station has been completely redeveloped to better meet today’s travel needs. It was opened late 2015. In other regions, the focus is more often on the construction of new public transport systems, like Shenzhen Metro’s new Line 4 - 15 stations built with provision for development above. “ Driving this need for integration is the fundamental question of what a station contributes – economically and socially – to a city. ” Malcolm Smith Director Malcolm Smith discusses his thoughts on the relationship between our stations and the concept of 'the red line'. To view this video, you must enable cookies. This renaissance brings new expectations. Some rail and metro stations, such as Cityringen in Copenhagen, are designed to be places of transit, prioritising citizens’ desire for simple journeys without distraction. In other stations, designers are called on to create dynamic, multifunctional spaces where people can do much more than set out or arrive on a journey. They are destinations in their own right, providing space for everything from libraries, medical centres and cinemas, to shopping and eating. This requires greater flexibility – as seen in Canary Wharf’s new Crossrail station, where the commercial space can be completely redesigned to meet tenant needs – this in turn needs careful planning and design. What’s known as the ‘red line’ that separates travel spaces from public spaces is more blurred. To get this right, station designers must become more open to involving the community in defining what their station is, what it will contain and how it contributes to the surrounding area. “ People sit at the very heart of our cities, and their stations, which is why we need to engage local communities in the renewal of these spaces, to encourage collaborative and tailored urban regeneration. ” Nille Juul-Sørensen Director Nille Juul-Sorensen discusses his thoughts on cities and how we can 'hack' our stations to make them more flexible, community focussed places. To view this video, you must enable cookies. Passenger needs are paramount, and considered at every stage of the planning process. The aim is to create stations that allow people to move through them – and pause within and around them – with ease, rather than simply in the way transport authorities think is best. At London’s King’s Cross Station, we modelled the expected flow of people in and around the station in minute detail, to get the design right. We must ‘design in’ flexibility, so that as people’s needs evolve stations can be adapted easily and quickly. 1 of 2 The freeform concrete interior of the Arnhem Central Station promotes fluid passenger transition. As stations become more flexible, they can also become more fun. Ikea certainly surprised passengers of the Parisian metro system when it placed a selection of its sofas on station platforms for people to test – and buy. Stations will always need to be places of safety and security, but there is no reason why they can’t delight and entertain. Rail and metro stations are powerful catalysts for regeneration. Distrito Castellana Norte Madrid acknowledges this: the regeneration scheme is being planned with a new high-speed rail at its heart. More than ever, stations are symbols of a place, and need to be seamlessly integrated into the personalities of the cities in which they are located.

213,Action plans for ageing cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/action-plans-for-ageing-cities,,"The global population is ageing at an unprecedented rate: by 2050 the number of people aged over 65 is expected to triple to two billion, representing 22% of the total population. In 2050, for the first time in human history, there will be more older adults than children under 15 years old. China, India and the United States, will each have over 100 million people aged over 65. Are cities ready for this societal change? From my point of view, enabling people to maintain a high quality of life and live independently into old age requires integrated action plans across cities. These would pull together different policies for health, social welfare, mobility, built and digital environments, not only at a city scale but also at a neighbourhood level. Unfortunately, as it stands, interventions that affect senior citizens’ quality of life are often fragmented and delivered by different city departments, without a common vision or a coherent relationship between them. For example, although the public welfare department in a city may offer its older citizens free or discounted travel rates, the transport department doesn’t necessarily improve its bus fleet with the low-floor technology needed for older adults to get onto buses easily. This doesn’t have to be the case. There are already many good examples of integrated action plans: Barcelona and New York are currently the most interesting, especially because they are already in place. But many other cities, including Brussels, Brisbane, Glasgow and Toronto are moving in the same direction. In Barcelona, with the Municipal Plan for the elderly 2013-2016, the city has defined four major strategies that generate 218 actions to be carried out in crucial domains, such as participation, welfare, healthcare and the way the elderly conduct their daily lives in the city. This ensures that things are done consistently across different domains. For example, installing gymnastic circuits in public spaces and parks could simultaneously improve the health and wellbeing of senior citizens, intergenerational social inclusion and the quality of outdoor spaces by reducing travel and cash outlay. Starting in 2007 with the Age friendly NYC public-private partnership, New York began developing a comprehensive action plan to address the challenges of growing older in the city. After an initial assessment of the city’s age-friendliness, 59 initiatives began. These cover four key areas (community and civic participation; housing; public spaces and transportation; and health and social services) and are designed to make the city more age-friendly. Age friendly NYC issues a biennial monitoring report outlining the progress in each of the 59 initiatives. Since they got underway in 2009, 77 out of 100 key central subway stations have been made accessible by improving the lifts and escalators; new automatic public toilets were installed in key locations citywide; and 25 street intersections with above average rates of injuries to older adults injuries have been altered. Following Barcelona and New York’s lead, I think more cities should promote and adopt these sorts of integrated action plans."
214,Let's evaluate urban interventions properly ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/lets-evaluate-urban-interventions-properly,,"I believe that when it comes to evaluating urban interventions, we are missing a trick. Evaluations of urban interventions (both physical and policy-based) are abundant, however their focus is too narrow. We can, and should, go further. Are we even asking ourselves the right questions? Take the theory of loop learning. This centres upon the difference between an evaluation which asks “Are we doing things right?” (single-loop learning) and the far broader, and in my view far better, “Are we doing the right things?” (double- loop learning). Whether we’re designing the next generation of bridges in London or masterplanning swathes of Johannesburg, the desire to benefit local communities is the driving force behind urban intervention. So our ultimate goal is in fact to do the right things. Despite this, too often evaluation strategies are primarily concerned with doing things right. The OMEGA Centre for Mega-Projects in Transport and Development reports that there is an excessive focus on the ‘iron-triangle’ of budget, timing and specification. This misses the more fundamental issue of whether the intervention was right in the first place. What we really need is a better understanding of the extent to which urban interventions have delivered wider benefits such as higher employment, wage growth or improved quality of life. For this reason, I believe we need to take a long-term approach to evaluation, one which is integrated into urban interventions from their inception and which continues long after completion. In addition, we should try to establish what impacts are directly caused by each intervention. This task is daunting, but it can be accomplished. The most accurate way to evaluate the extent to which an intervention causes local benefits is through counterfactual evaluation, which compares observed outcomes with what we would have expected to happen without the intervention. High Speed 1 (HS1) is a good example of a project that is lauded for meeting its schedule and its budget, and it has undoubtedly brought far-reaching benefits. But there have been few (if any) attempts to establish what would have happened without it – as a result of wider economic trends, for example. Who’s to say that adding more lanes to the adjacent M2 motorway, or building superfast broadband wouldn’t have been better alternatives? Similarly, we can also learn a lot more about iconic projects that are deemed to be successful for reasons other than simply time, budget and specification, for example King’s Cross Central. Until we really get to grips with the causal effects of these types of interventions, how can we be sure that we’re making the right decisions? Counterfactual evaluation isn’t straightforward, not least because the effects of major projects often take many years to become apparent, and because it can be difficult to get adequate data. The process is also time-consuming and resource-intensive, so it has largely been confined to academia and larger-scale policy interventions. Indeed, the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth has repeatedly shown that there is a real shortage of robust counterfactual evaluations at our disposal. We need to convince policymakers and the private sector that conducting the evaluation is worth it, given the fundamental information we gain. Counterfactual evaluation is an extremely useful tool for evaluating the wider impact of urban interventions, and knowing the magnitude of these impacts allows us to understand which interventions really work. We can then do the right things in our towns and cities, helping us shape even better places. So let’s do the right thing and start evaluating properly!"
215,What is a city?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/what-is-a-city,,"I don’t think it’s possible to understand or describe cities; a city is not one thing, but many things in negotiation. Cities are complex, contradictory and in a continual state of increasingly rapid flux. Yet cities are central to the nature of human settlement in the 21st century like no other time in human history. I believe the city of the 21st century and beyond will be fundamentally different to the cities that have gone before – reflecting the increasing complexity of urban living. To address this complexity you need to remember that, ultimately, cities are places where people gather, either by choice or by circumstance. These people have needs that must be fulfilled – needs that are common to all cities and needs that are unique to that particular city. A city is characterised by the way it identifies, responds to and continually re-evaluates these needs. As sociologist Richard Sennett says: “The quality of life in a city is good when its inhabitants are capable of dealing with complexity.” As designers we need to understand the nature of these needs in different places. We need to understand their priorities. To help cities grow and improve, we need a way in which to start to understand their contradictory and transactional nature. How can we get to grips with the fact that cities are physical and non-physical, immediate and temporal? The answer lies in the fact that the complexity of a city results from addressing specific issues. Yet often particular needs such as housing, the environment or wellbeing are considered in relative isolation. I think the creative response is to identify the key inter-relationships. I know this is the approach we take at Arup. At La Rinconada in Caracas, what started as the construction of a new bus interchange was quickly transformed into a major regeneration initiative with housing, parks and a 50,000-seat football stadium. And in Foshan, China, we were able to adjust the route of a new metro line to prioritise station locations that will drive growth. Similarly, in our work with the Rockefeller Foundation on the Framework we considered how multiple inter-related issues affect cities’ ability to weather shocks and stresses. By taking this approach, I believe we can help shape successful, authentic cities. And while cities are complex, changing places, the test of their success is possibly much simpler: a successful city is a place that people want to be in, can afford to be in, and possibly most importantly, want to stay in."
216,Let's design building facades that promote happiness ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/lets-design-building-facades-that-promote-happiness,,"It’s time to think bigger about the role facades play in buildings. Beyond simply protecting us from the elements, facades have the potential to actively promote the happiness of their users as multisensory environmental filters. In Europe, people spend 90% of their time inside buildings and industry is starting to accept that they must be designed to promote health and wellbeing. Building facades are a key part of this as they are our both our connection to and protection from the outdoors. Facades play a big part in determining the internal building so are therefore both a critical factor and an opportunity to do better. And facades’ multisensory role means they have the potential to have a large and beneficial impact on people’s lives well beyond their standard architectural purpose. For example, consider how facades conduct daylight. The colour and intensity of facades influence how our bodies produce hormones like melatonin and serotonin – these in turn affect our sense of wakefulness and quality of mood. And views (especially of vegetation or sky) are also psychologically important – improving both our concentration, creativity and productivity. To design a truly effective façade means tackling a complex combination of building physics, user interaction and operational factors. These are not simple to resolve. While we need daylight, too much glass is bad - it can impair visual comfort for screen users, and the solar gains can cause overheating. So what we could term ‘happier’ façades will require summing marginal gains across multiple factors. Too often, full height glazing is used without thought, perhaps for aesthetic rather than pragmatic reasons. In reality, full height glazing is often not even 100% glazing – but tall, narrow windows that reduce privacy and end up simply displaying the backs of furniture to the public. The lower part of this glazing still leads to heat loss and gain, but does not contribute much to daylight as it is so low, and often obscured by furniture. Facades that rely on glazing often require extensive mitigation. Large areas of a building’s glazing might require a coating to reduce heat gains, but in so doing end up reducing the overall daylight level inside. The resulting grey-lit interiors could have been avoided if glazing had been used in a more measured way. Noise can also adversely affect our mental state, affecting our ability to concentrate, relax and sleep. Noise can cause increased levels of stress hormones, which may have long-term effects on physical health. So improved design of facades must respond to environmental noise and sound transmission considerations in order to function effectively. Control is important too. Something as simple as the ability to open windows for example, has a positive impact on our stress levels – actually making us better able to cope with discomfort as well as difficult work situations. Good design sometimes means rethinking the fundamentals, I think it’s time to re-centre the design around the occupant. For facades, it’s time to go beyond business as usual and really consider how buildings get used."
217,Walkonomics: the high line effect ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/walkonomics-the-high-line-effect,,"Investing in walkable public spaces should be a no-brainer; they can be a catalyst for regeneration, make cities attractive to private investments and provide economic benefits to communities. Walkable streets and attractive public spaces have proven social and environmental benefits. They enhance liveability – increasing social cohesion and encouraging physical activity while reducing traffic and improving air quality. However, the fact that the public realm can be also incredibly profitable is less well understood and often overlooked. Recent research commissioned by Living Streets shows that “making places better for walking can boost footfall and trading by up to 40%, while good urban design can raise retail rents by up to 20%”. Using sales tax receipts to compare retail activity before and after street redesigns, the New York City's Department of Transportation has recently proved that transforming an underused parking area in a pedestrian plaza in Brooklyn has led to a dramatic increase of 172% in retail sales. Publicly funded schemes to improve walkability can add significant value to private property – as Transport for London’s Valuing Urban Realm (VUR) Toolkit has demonstrated. It showed how in The Cut a recent £3m investment in widening pavements, planting trees, improving lighting and creating space for outdoor dining increased local property prices by over £9.5m. In the US, Walk Score, a walkability index based on the presence of amenities within walking distance, allows people to find apartments and rentals in livable environments. Academics have used Walk Score to show how a walkable urban public realm directly translates into an increase in home values of between $700 and $3,000 for each point on a score out of 100. Improving public realm is also fundamentally important for urban regeneration. In New York, the $115m the city spent on the High Line generated over $2bn in private investment surrounding the park. The ‘Bilbao effect’ showed how a city could reinvent itself through iconic architecture. Now the ‘High Line effect’ has shown how an iconic park can attract five million visitors a year, create 12,000 jobs and double the property value in the surrounding area. At the urban scale, cities like Barcelona and Melbourne have combined regenerating public space for social and environmental benefits with a branded place-making process. In the last 20 years, Barcelona has implemented a public space policy that involves tearing down former factories and warehouses and creating hundreds of new parks, squares and promenades, boosting its annual visitor numbers from 1.7 to 7.4 million. In the same period, the city of Melbourne renovated its pavements and street furniture and turned narrow back alleyways (known as laneways in Australia) into a walkable network that increased pedestrian traffic by 40%. The city also activated the alleyways as destinations in their own right - complete with cafes and restaurants. In fact, outdoor cafes have increased from fewer than 50 in 1990 to over 600 today. In 2014, The Economist nominated Melbourne as the Most Liveable City in the world for the fourth consecutive time. The city's economic vitality has enjoyed a similar boost. Liveable places and walkable environments make cities more vibrant, sustainable and healthier, but also more attractive. They boost the urban economy, and they definitely make us all richer – in every sense of the word. This is another reason to put the quality of public space at the heart of placemaking."
218,Street lighting must get smarter,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/street-lighting-must-get-smarter,,"Turning off street lights at an arbitrary time such as midnight may appeal to city leaders. After all, doesn’t it save both money and energy? I don’t believe it’s this simple. Instead, I think the rise and fall of public lighting in a city should be determined by the activity on its streets and pavements. This more nuanced approach would see light provided when it’s needed. For example, if all the restaurants and shops in an area are still open at 8pm, their lights may be enough to illuminate the street. So public lighting may not need to be on at this time, at least not at full power. But at 11pm, say, there may be shift workers going home or clubbers going out. With shops and restaurants now closed, there would be no private light spilling onto the street and public lighting should be on to help people travel safely and securely. Some cities around the world are experimenting with this approach. Glasgow is trialling ‘intuitive’ street lighting that responds to factors such as noise. I think cities need to make use of new technology in this way. But they also need to engage with the issue more fundamentally. I’d argue that cities need lighting committees in the same way they have planning committees. These would build an understanding of an area, including predicted, planned development, of how people will use the public space and therefore how it should be lit. I also think it’s essential to involve local communities in this process. In Cartagena, Colombia, Arup is researching how to create high-quality night-time public spaces. As part of the project, districts are invited to explore their after-dark hours, highlight dark spots and gaps – those that are unsafe or unwelcoming – and influence design decisions. Ultimately, night-time is essentially different from daytime. So it deserves its own design approach, and thinking creatively and smarter about street lighting is a vital part of this."
219,Reigniting civic space,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/reigniting-civic-space,,"Stations have increasingly become transitional, functional spaces; neglected as places for us to take delight in. I think we need to revive the vitality and vigour they once brought to the everyday lives of their communities. Stations of the past were at the heart of civic life, alongside libraries, post offices and even power stations. Learning from history can help us to create more vibrant, useful and integrated station spaces that have the community at their core. Without the bustle of bodies stepping onto the platform, rushing to catch the next departing train, greeting loved ones or waving them goodbye, our stations would not only be soul-less but purpose-less. Broadening our view to see them as nodes of urban redevelopment will help us to avoid creating a ‘one size fits all’ solution. Designers need to look deeper into our communities to encourage more creativity, unlocking tailored and forward-thinking forms of regeneration. People sit at the very heart of our cities, and their stations, which is why we need to engage local communities in the renewal of these spaces, to encourage collaborative and bespoke urban transformation. Like a person, each city and each station has its own personality and we need to create innovative new uses for these buildings to remain at the heart of the communities they serve. Stations need to be re-created, to work for each individual space and to optimise the value they create as part of the wider city. And it’s not just large city stations that need to be reignited, we need to give smaller stations more attention too. Designers need to work with the people who use these civic spaces to find out not only what they really want, but what they need. An interesting example of this is the insertion of a library into the facilities of a Danish swimming pool. What started as a clever way to engage adults with children in swimming lessons became an opportunity for those children to discover and embrace literature. Another example of this innovative thinking is Daan Roosegaarde’s Smart Highway perspective on ‘hacking’ roads instead of vehicles to digitally monitor and adapt to light and weather. This reflects a new way of thinking yet to have been exhibited in the regeneration of communal spaces and particularly in stations. A Copenhagen power station which hosts a ski slope in the winter and transforms to a skate park in the summer, is another great example of how we can think smarter about reigniting urban public space. This building has been transformed from a dead, uninhabited power hub into an active and central part of the local community. Let’s not lose our stations from the heart of civic life but restore them with innovation and excitement. Not only do we need to consult with the community, but we need to think outside our traditional infrastructural boundaries. If we don’t create spaces people want to enjoy, what role will they play in society?"
220,Spaces of resilience,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/spaces-of-resilience,,"People need public spaces in bad times as well as good. Public spaces are very important when we think of the liveability of our cities; examples of that are demonstrated in Cities Alive. But cities also face major shocks, stresses and uncertainty; and therefore it is time to think about the resilience of our cities. Arup’s work on resilience has highlighted 12 key areas that contribute to the overall resilience of a city. Contrary to the common understanding, resilience is not just about robust infrastructure and emergency drills; it is also about the places where we interact with others every day – among these, public spaces are key. Public spaces have played a critical role in resilience for many years. A relevant historic example is the magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck San Francisco in 1906, causing widespread fires and destroying thousands of homes. In response, ‘housing camps’ including mobile hospitals, food and water kiosks were set up in the city’s parks and public spaces. Because of the way the city had been planned, the way the land use was distributed and the way the open spaces had been designed, there was plenty of room for shelter camps. In other words, spare capacity embedded in the city. In cities such as Beirut where public space is scarce, finding spaces like this is more of a challenge. Yet, during the 2006 Lebanon war, Sanayeh Garden acted as a refugee camp for 450 people whose homes had been bombed. The park became their home for the six weeks of the war and beyond. Similarly, after the earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in 2010, hundreds of families fled to the parks around the Palais Nationale and Place St Pierre in Petion-Ville. People felt safe in these spaces because of their openness and visibility. These camps became the places that international agencies prioritised for water and food, and later became hubs for reconstruction efforts. These examples show that we cannot think of our public spaces as ‘nice to have’ – they are ‘must have’ in resilient cities. Today, in light of globalisation, rapid urbanisation and climate change, I think it is time to rethink the role of our public spaces. Can our urban spaces always be designed in a multifunctional way to support better resilience? Can our playgrounds become smarter places for communities to connect and support each other? Can parks and urban space help during flooding? Can streets and cycling routes provide networks of resilience through our cities? What ideas do you have?"
221,Parametric design for better buildings,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/parametric-design-for-better-buildings,,"Parametric design lets you specify the key parameters of your project and make changes interactively, with the model updating automatically. It can be used for architectural showmanship but I believe good engineers will use it to make more efficient designs, explore more options, and optimise buildings. In fact, I think it’s our job as engineers to help architects take full advantage of parametric design. By finding the right input parameters and geometrical logic we can achieve simultaneously a challenging aesthetic shape and an efficient design. This is nothing new in terms of engineering best practice, but it is now possible to do it at a much higher level thanks to these tools. Will this make designers rely too heavily on computers or produce shapes that are unnecessarily complex and full of waste? I don’t think so, if they are used as an aid to, rather than a replacement for, good engineering. As engineers, we must still use our judgement, experience and professional standards to define reasonable design parameters and understand their relative importance to the safety and quality of the building. This approach not only applies to geometrical parameters, but to all the design assumptions engineers make to plan for the uncertainties and possible variations of the design environment during the building life cycle. Yet parametric design tools are incredibly useful – particularly for high-rise buildings in China, where the high level of seismicity makes the analysis process even more complex – even in early project phases. On the China Zun Z15 tower in Beijing, using these tools has reduced the time between architectural proposition and analysis from weeks to just days. It’s led us to a better design, with more in-depth understanding of the critical parameters of the structure. And it’s enabled us to study the most efficient scheme amongst the numerous design options. The different tools have now developed user-friendly interfaces which makes it easier to engage the client and architect on higher level discussions on the topic of design parameters and on the geometric logic of the shape (for example for fabrication issues). The information exchanged between engineer and architect is also of higher value, since you don’t exchange only the final design geometry but also the logic of your design. Parametric design also offers a good way to have a stronger influence on key design decisions, by analysing more options and giving quantitative feedback, whereas before we could only give global trends based on intuition or very simplified studies. This is particularly useful in a context like China, where the culture and the clients demand that projects must be planned, designed and built super-fast, while breaking world records at the same time (the 528m high Z15 tower is to be the world highest tower in a region of high seismicity). And finally, parametric design can help us use resources more efficiently through optimisation studies. That’s why I think parametric design is not so far away from our engineering best practice and used efficiently can really lead to a better world. Do you agree?"
222,How is China transforming its cities?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/how-is-china-transforming-its-cities,,"China is showing the rest of the world how to expand and transform its cities. The speed and scale of the transformation is unprecedented. It isn’t just happening in one or two cities but across the country. And it involves a whole range of city types, from newly emerging industrial centres Wuxi to well-developed urban areas like Shanghai. In the last twenty years, Shanghai has transformed itself from a city based around manufacturing to one with service industries at its heart. Today it is home to lawyers, accountants, engineers, architects and other professions. Meanwhile, Wuxi is changing from an agricultural centre to an industrial one. What drives this change? To a large extent it’s transport infrastructure. China has shown that for second-tier cities to flourish they need excellent infrastructure to link them to hubs such as Shanghai or Beijing. Today you can complete a journey in an hour that two decades ago would have taken you most of the day. By investing heavily in transport infrastructure, the Chinese Government has given its cities strong foundations on which to grow. Projects such as the transport-orientated development in the Shanghai suburb of Xinzhuang put mobility at the heart of urban development. And these projects plan for the long term – generating demand, rather than simply accommodating current pressures. Of course, investing in infrastructure such as high-speed rail before demand really exists isn’t a luxury that many countries could afford. And in many places it also takes much longer to plan, finance and build transport links than it does in China. But this doesn’t mean that China and the rest of the world can’t learn from each other. The Chinese government can’t finance infrastructure forever. Sooner or later, it will have to introduce some sort of public-private partnership model. It will also need to introduce more competition to focus operators on improving efficiency and service quality. And in both these areas it can draw on lessons from elsewhere. At the same time, China has much to offer other countries. It is keen to invest in transport infrastructure abroad to gain experience of these markets and spread its investment risk. And the country’s rapid expansion has given its construction industry a wealth of expertise that it is now keen to share. This is why China’s urban transformation is not just good for the Chinese people, but for everyone."
223,What makes a city resilient?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/what-makes-a-city-resilient,,"Throughout history, cities have demonstrated their resilience time and time again, evolving or transforming in the face of resource shortages, disease, natural hazards or conflict. But what and who makes a city resilient? As a recent research project I led shows, it’s a combination of four things: people, place, organisation and knowledge. Over the past year, with the support of The Rockefeller Foundation, a team from Arup International Development has studied this to develop the City Resilience Framework. Our motivation has been to equip city governments, investors, policy makers, planners and engineers with the ability to identify and prioritise investment and action. Because if they are to collectively support and foster more resilient cities, they need a common understanding of what constitutes a resilient city and how it is achieved. It’s a question that is becoming increasingly important as more and more people are living in cities. Meanwhile, global pressures – disease pandemics, economic fluctuations, climate change and terrorism – that play out at city scale pose new challenges. Urban risk is not only increasing, it is also increasingly unpredictable due to the complexity of city systems and the uncertainty associated with many hazards – notably climate change. Risk assessments and measures to reduce specific foreseeable risks will continue to play an important role in urban planning. But cities also need to be resilient so as to be able to accommodate the unexpected. As part of our work with The Rockefeller Foundation, I’ve spent time in cities around the world talking to governments, businesses and ordinary people. I’ve asked them what shocks and stresses they have faced, what triggered physical collapse, social breakdown or economic decline, and what prevented it. What led the citizens of New York City to pull together following Superstorm Sandy? Why has recovery in Port au Prince, Haiti following the earthquake on 12 January 2010 proven so challenging? Why did the massive 8.8 earthquake in Concepcion, Chile a month later lead to extensive looting and arson, even though there was relatively little damage to buildings (due to seismic codes being enforced)? Each city is unique. The way resilience manifests itself plays out very differently in different places. Yet, common themes have emerged. At Arup, we’ve concluded that it is a combination of four things: People – the health and wellbeing of individuals Place – the way in which infrastructure and ecosystems protect, provide for and connect urban citizens Organisation – the social and financial systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully, and act collectively Knowledge – the importance of informed decision making, and empowered stakeholders. The City Resilience Framework provides a lens through which the complexity of cities and the factors that contribute to resilience can be understood. It comprises 12 indicators that equate to a city’s immune system. Collectively, they enable people to survive and thrive, and businesses to prosper whatever shocks and stresses may occur. At the moment city resilience isn’t a term that’s very widely used or even understood. But it’s central to the wellbeing of urban communities, the natural and built environment and economy. We can’t underestimate the importance of building resilience."
224,Streets: the best use of public space?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/streets-the-best-use-of-public-space,,"In London, streets make up 80% of public space. As our rapidly urbanising cities face gridlock, I think we’re going to see some of this space reallocated to more people-centred and sustainable uses. In London, as in many cities, the typical street is an asphalt paved surface with buried utilities and pedestrian footpaths on both sides, separated from the carriageway by parallel parking and loading bays. Now two forces are driving us to reconsider this particular use of public space. The first is sustainability. Car use is discouraged by the congestion charge and by petrol taxes. Cycle use is actively promoted, with cars excluded from new cycle lanes and superhighways, and cycle hire stands replacing on-street parking spaces. Sustainable utilities are also looking a bit different from the grids we’re used to. Power, heating and cooling can all be provided onsite or with local networks. Rain and grey water are being captured and reused. Large-scale regional utility grids won’t go away, but in time they may become less critical and voluminous – needing less of our street space. We’re also starting to include green infrastructure: the public realm should incorporate surfaces that absorb storm water, planting that mitigates pollution, and routes for wildlife. Second, the faster-than-expected population growth in cities means that a finite space needs to be shared by more people. The 2011 census showed that London, at 8.2 million, is 400000 people bigger than we realised. Public transport is a far more efficient use of space than individual cars: one double-decker London bus holds around 80 people. Even so, the kind of significant capacity increases we need can only really be delivered underground – Crossrail, for example, will add 10% to the capacity of London’s underground network. Public transport concentrates people, bringing them to stations and bus stops. So higher-capacity transport systems will need a larger public realm to disperse arriving passengers: you can’t just dump larger numbers of people onto existing footpaths. More people also need more parks (an additional 9000ha of accessible green space in London by 2050) and more leisure spaces. These three uses – pedestrian, leisure and green – complement each other. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that streets just aren’t the best use of the vast area of public space they currently consume. Does this mean streets will disappear? I doubt it. But they will be transformed. I predict that networks – roads as well as metros and utilities – will continue to move underground. Streets will increasingly be redesigned for last-mile journeys (particularly those on foot), leisure uses and green infrastructure. Indeed, this transformation is happening already. The new Crossrail station and expanded Underground station at Tottenham Court Road will be complemented by new public spaces, created by closing underused streets. And boulevards will replace the existing one-way street system. At King’s Cross, over a third of the 67 acre regeneration site has been set aside for public space. And of this, more than 60% is parks, squares and pedestrian priority routes, with servicing to the commercially led southern part of the site provided underground. These two examples – one the incremental transformation of an existing urban fabric, the second a masterplanned new development – illustrate two approaches to creating a more people-centred city. London’s transformation, incremental and planned, matters, because it’s a transformation that growing cities worldwide are going to need to make."
225,Urban acupuncture,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/urban-acupuncture,,"I have always been somewhat sceptical when it comes to alternative medicine, but I rather like the idea of urban acupuncture – fast-tracked planning and design interventions whose benefits are felt sooner. The interventions don’t have to be small-scale. It’s just that they’re implemented in swift moves, without the pain associated with long planning processes. This ensures that the schemes’ healing effect is realised sooner. What about schemes such as bus rapid transit networks, public parks, civic buildings, or pedestrianisation? You might argue they should be the result of a robust process of concept, planning, design and construction. But the experience of Curitiba in Brazil says otherwise. I listened to the city’s former mayor, Jaime Lerner, talk about his experience of using urban acupunture and was won over. I’m convinced that it is possible to implement meaningful ideas within a much shorter programme. Take the Opera de Arame (the Wire Opera), for example. A venue with capacity for 2,400 spectators built with tubular steel, it took just 75 days to construct and is now one of the main attractions in Curitiba. The Opera de Arame sits within one of the many urban parks resulting from an imaginative process that sees landowners agree to release 75% of their property in exchange for the rights to develop the remaining 25%. This process has peppered the city with very attractive parks of varying size and formality, which also boost the value of developments. I think it’s clear that, in Curitiba, urban acupuncture has been working. It is a progressive city punching well above its weight. Its public transport system carries over 2.3 million passengers a day (the population of the metropolitan area is approximately 3.2 million). And it recycles 70% of its waste. There must be something that professionals of the urban environment can learn from Curitiba and from its influential mayor of nearly 20 years. And I think it’s that we put too much emphasis on the process rather than on what we are ultimately trying to achieve."
226,Why gentrification isnt the answer,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/why-gentrification-isnt-the-answer,,"If planners are ever going to create stable, sustainable neighbourhoods, I think it’s about time they stopped trying to make places cool and realised the value of the more commonplace, everyday features that really make communities work. It’s 50 years since Ruth Glass coined the term gentrification to refer to the rapidly changing class structure of some of London’s traditional working class districts. Despite all that has happened to our urban environments in the half-century since, gentrification has remained a constant. From Brooklyn to Barnsbury, Wan Chai to Maboneng, the journey from ailing industrial district to boho, arty cluster to eventual bourgeois, barista-driven utopia is both global in its incidence and inevitable in its process. Gentrification is often lauded in its nascent stages, when the creativity and edginess of its first-wave-form appears authentic and pure. At this point everyone hopes the increased social and economic capital brought by its pioneers will miraculously transform opportunities for the existing, often deprived, population. Indeed, many urban planners and city mayors’ regeneration efforts are often focused on nurturing this ‘organic’ renewal process. This may be in the form of providing incubator space in the hope that tech start-ups will drive forward change or through the renovation of decaying industrial warehouses to give greater investor confidence. But the reality is that gentrified neighbourhoods nearly always become victims of their own success; the original community long displaced and the pioneer community increasingly threatened by ever-escalating rents and the commercialisation of culture. Gallerist and club owner Alex Proud recently discussed this in his article that explored why the ‘Shoreditchification’ of London must stop. He pointed to the ‘relentless churn and accelerated neophilia’ of current gentrification that prevents the creation of real places with any sense of longevity. Similarly, journalist Zoe Corbyn asks: “Is San Francisco losing its soul?” She observes that the big pay cheques from Silicon Valley are hastily changing even this most longstanding of liberal and counter-cultural outposts as “a new breed of men and women too busy with iPhones to ‘be here’ in the moment”. In his article, Proud coined the concept of ‘sustainable coolness’ to posit how urban neighbourhoods can maintain their cultural appeal by sticking to their roots and being treated like real places rather than “Apple products with a two-year upgrade cycle”. This is certainly an incredibly valid point, but it is worrisome in its suggestion that for a place to be a place, that it has to be cool in the first place. The best, most functioning urban environments are surely those with varied and accessible housing choice, good local schools, sustainable transport links and a strong community infrastructure, whether this is manifested in a thriving high street or local social and sports clubs. Yes, such places might have trendy restaurants and buzzing bars (which is great for those who want this). But they equally might simply have a local supermarket, park and post office, which should not be taken as a proxy for failure. If planners are ever going to separate regeneration from gentrification they need to keep in mind that for places, whilst style is nice, substance is best."
227,Cities must help produce more food,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/cities-must-help-produce-more-food,,"If the world is going to feed its growing and increasingly urban population in the face of climate change, then cities must take more responsibility for producing the extra food needed. By 2050, most predictions estimate the planet will need to feed an additional two billion mouths. As more people adopt meaty, Western-style diets, the world will need to produce as much food in the next 50 years as it’s managed in the last 10,000 years. That’s what the World Economic Forum estimates. It’s quite a challenge, and one which I think cities have to be part of, finding a solution. Cities are where the majority of people live. They are responsible for the majority of carbon dioxide emissions. And they are where the majority of the nutrients from agriculture end up – flushed down an urban sewer. What’s clear is that we will need to find a new approach to food production. Not only because of the scale of the problem, but because agriculture is currently unsustainable. Many of today’s farms greedily consume energy, water, artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs in volumes that are having serious consequences for the environment. From the methane output of cows to the carbon dioxide released by clearing trees to grow crops, agriculture emits more greenhouse gases than all forms of transport combined. It’s also responsible for around 70% of all drinking water consumption, and pollutes much of the water it uses with fertiliser, manure and run-off from fields. And as if that wasn’t enough, it’s also been shown to be a big threat to biodiversity. So what can cities do? I think there are opportunities to use joined-up thinking and close some resource loops. Cities produce many things as waste that farmers need for food growing. For example, rooftop greenhouses like those belonging to Gotham Greens could use carbon dioxide emissions from combined heat and power plants to help grow food like tomatoes. Making use of roof space like this is one way cities can accommodate more food production within their boundaries and reduce their carbon emissions in the process – something it will be vital to do. Currently, agriculture and urban development often compete for space and resources. When a city grows, agricultural land is usually swallowed up.This in turn means farmers need to clear more land, emitting more carbon dioxide in the process. We cannot keep doing this indefinitely. And we probably can’t all keep eating the same diet we have now. What city dwellers eat has a big impact on the foods grown to feed them. So, as my colleague Jody Harris suggests, looking closely at which foods we eat and why could help. For example, it’s not sensible to grow wheat in a city but you could grow plenty of nut trees, so maybe we should eat more of those instead. They are also a good source of protein, so perhaps we need less milk and meat from cows and can reduce the methane they produce. But we must not look at cities in isolation. For me, this comes down to redefining the relationship between our urban and rural areas. We need to stop seeing them as separate and treat them as an integrated, symbiotic system. Food needs to become part of everything that cities do. There have been some moves in this direction already. Arup’s masterplan for Wanzhuang Eco-City in China incorporates 42 existing villages and preserves farmland. And Finland’s first carbon-neutral district, Jätkäsaari in Helsinki, recognises the importance of locally grown food by including a community greenhouse. If we’re all to remain confident of having enough food on our plates in the coming decades, more cities must innovate and embrace agriculture."
228,Will San Francisco survive the next quake?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/will-san-francisco-survive-the-next-quake,,"If San Francisco were to experience a repeat of its devastating 1906 earthquake, modern building codes should prevent extensive loss of life. But although buildings might not collapse, they could still be rendered useless for years, severely disrupting the life of the city. This is why we need to adopt resilience-based design. Seismic building codes are based on ductility – how much you can deform a building before it collapses – and focuses on saving lives. Resilience-based design, on the other hand, seeks to keep people safe and ensure that buildings (and all the components and contents within the building) sustain less damage, enabling communities to recover quickly. You only have to look at the experience of Christchurch to see why we need to adopt resilience-based design. As Andrew Wisdom said in his Thought post, the quake made the city centre uninhabitable. Rebuilding is only just starting, more than three years after the earthquake, and it looks as though recovery could easily take a decade or more. I think this is what the average citizen doesn’t realise. Building codes reassure people they will be safe if an earthquake strikes, but in doing so they offer a false sense of security about what life will be like once the shaking stops. I don’t think many people realise that a building that meets the latest seismic codes may still be unusable after an earthquake. So designing buildings to be minimally damaged by using innovative structural technologies (such as base isolation) to reduce earthquake demands and enhanced architectural detailing, could save a lot of heartache, disruption and expense. Arup’s research has shown that the cost of repairing code-designed buildings following an earthquake is typically 20-25% of their value. And can you imagine surviving a major earthquake only to find your home uninhabitable and your business disrupted for years? It’s almost unthinkable. That’s why Arup has developed a guideline to implement resilience-based earthquake design through a new rating system with support from multi-disciplinary design professionals and other stakeholders. The highest level (Platinum) of our Resilience-based Earthquake Design Initiative (REDi) Rating System would see buildings designed so they could be re-occupied immediately. They would be functioning normally again within 72 hours and repairs would cost less than 2.5% of the building’s value. Of course, such a high level of resilience comes at a price – but it’s not a significant one. We’ve established that stepping up from a conventional design to a REDi Gold rating (which corresponds to functionality within 30 days), adds less than 5% to construction costs. Incentives could offset the small cost premium and encourage owners to adopt resilience-based design. Maybe cities or governments could offer flexibility in zoning requirements or insurance companies could offer lower premiums for buildings designed to be resilient. Or would a REDi Platinum rating attract higher rents? This will not happen overnight, but if we can replace our dilapidated building stock with resilient buildings (and infrastructure) over the course of a generation, we can ensure that San Francisco not only survives, but thrives after a major earthquake."
229,Walkable cities are better cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/walkable-cities-are-better-cities,,"I have a simple solution for cities with congested roads, overburdened metros, unhealthy populations and flagging town centres: get more people walking. Walking has a host of health benefits. Among other things, it can halve your risk of heart disease, help prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes and some cancers, and even slow cognitive decline in adults – especially those with existing conditions such as Alzheimer’s. These benefits add up. Recent research from RIBA found that UK taxpayers could save nearly £1bn a year in obesity-related healthcare costs if people could be persuaded to walk more each week. And that’s not all. Transport for London's Town Centre Study 2011 found that people who walked to town centres across London spent more per week than those who came by bus, train, tube, bike or car. Given the benefits, it seems astounding that cities don’t do more to encourage walking. There are more advantages, too. It’s the lowest-carbon, least polluting form of transport. It’s a great social leveller (there are no first-class carriages on the pavements). And having people walking through urban spaces makes them safer for others. Another great thing about walking is that everybody everywhere can do it – unless they are in the small minority with a disability that prevents them. So walking is a mode of transport that works as well for developed cities as it does for developing cities. Walking is the ideal form of transport in cities like London where half of car journeys are less than 2km – just 25 minutes’ walk. So I’ve been pleased to see Transport for London working hard to promote walking through initiatives such as its Legible London maps. This simple idea, a wayfinding system that shows you how long it takes to walk from place to place, is already making walking journeys simpler. I’m also pleased to see cities not previously known for being walkable now catching on to the idea. In the US, Oklahoma’s mayor declared in 2007 that he wanted citizens to lose a million pounds in weight collectively. He wanted to help them lose weight, as he had, by walking more. Since then the city has built new sidewalks to connect schools with neighbourhoods and slowed traffic by turning one-way streets back into two-way routes. The fact that such work is necessary shows how, until now, walking hasn’t been taken seriously as a mode of transport. Even today, it’s still largely seen as the option of last resort – and policy documents usually lump it together unhelpfully with cycling. So although new developments may consider walking, you’ll rarely find it placed at the heart of plans. To get people walking, I think cities also need better wayfinding along safe routes; seating to encourage use of public space (and give walkers somewhere to rest); trees to provide shade; and more public toilets. If your city had these things, would it encourage you to walk more?"
230,New robots will revolutionise the built environment,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/new-robots-will-revolutionise-the-built-environment,,"In the past, robots were used for specialist jobs that were too dull, too dangerous or too dirty for people to do. Today, thanks to their ability to process sensor data in real time, robots do an incredible range of things. They already clean your house. Soon they’ll be able to help design and build your house too. The tipping point has come as robotics has shifted from being the domain of the mechanical engineer to the realm of network experts. They’ve applied smartphone technology to produce robots that can sense, process data, and communicate with each other via the cloud to learn. One example is Roomba, a vacuum-cleaning robot. In its first generation, Roomba would bump around your walls. Then it learned how to sense and spare your furniture. Now in its third generation, Roomba takes a picture of your ceiling to know where it is, a technique called robotic mapping. Telecoms company Qualcomm has demonstrated the potential of this approach by taking a smartphone and adding four wheels and a motor. The power of the smartphone industry’s skills and technology might enable developers to leap 30 years of development and produce a robot capable of much more sophisticated actions than anything that has gone before. What does this mean for construction? Traditionally, building takes place onsite and by hand. In the future, according to conventional thinking, machines will perform construction offsite. But this has been proposed for years. I think there will be an alternative: robots working onsite alongside humans. This is something researchers at ETH Zürich have begun to explore. Give a robot a pile of bricks, and it will build you a perfect wall. And it can achieve effects that a human bricklayer simply can’t, such as turning each brick by exactly one degree to produce a very subtly curved wall. It does the same with timber cladding and tiles. The leap in robotics has implications for design too. I don’t think we’ll see robots designing buildings autonomously. But I do think we could see them working alongside designers. You could use a robot to help you build a physical model, for example. And companies such as Skycatch already use drones for 3D scanning to provide cost-effective, high-speed and high-quality data about an area. Should we be worried about any of this? Are machines going to take our place? I don’t think so. As I heard inventor Saul Griffiths point out, robots are still blind, stupid, fat, weak, slow and difficult. They’re an opportunity, not a threat."
231,Landscape essential for healthier cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/landscape-essential-for-healthier-cities,,"The state of the nation’s health is rarely out of the news, and much has been written about the increase of obesity, health inequalities and the best way of caring for an ageing population. People may not realise the essential role that good quality urban landscape and open space can play in improving public health – and evidence from recent global research is overwhelming – well planned, designed and managed landscape in cities can save our health service billions. The chief executive of the Woodland Trust is on record as saying £2.1bn of healthcare costs could be saved in the UK if everyone had access to green spaces. And a recent study from the University of Exeter found that living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people's mental wellbeing. Green space enables people to walk or cycle more easily – something that’s good for everyone. The city of Copenhagen has recently created a cycle super-highway, and with it a healthier population; a study estimated that each kilometre cycled benefits society by $0.25 creating an estimated £12m saving in healthcare costs every year. The UK Forestry Commission reckons that a 1% reduction in the number of sedentary people in Britain would result in £1.44bn a year in economic benefits due to reduced health risks. Even the smallest green spaces create benefits. Another recent study found that creating green walls in urban areas could cut pollution by 30%. So cities need to find imaginative ways to create green space for their citizens. Think of the High Line project in New York, which has transformed an obsolete freight rail line into an acclaimed urban park. Smaller scale interventions like green roof and walls are vital , but cities also need to ‘think big’ – as Madrid has done with the Madrid Rio project. Its entire 43km southern ring road is now tunnelled and replaced by a city park and restored river environment. This major open space provides valuable amenity, significantly reduces pollution and also provides other benefits such as storage for stormwater. ‘Thinking big’ can also mean it is important to build landscape in at a strategic policy level; in response to health problems created by a series of heat waves in the early 2000s London developed the All London Green Grid, which aims to create a network of interlinked green spaces to create healthier places. Likewise, the City of Berlin has a regulation in place that requires developers to create a certain percentage of green space with each development to increase health benefits for its citizens. Other cities need to follow these good approaches and recognise the enormous potential of landscape as a health asset in urban areas. Given the pressure on our urban areas for space, and considering the health, environmental and economic benefits of landscape, it must be planned as an essential as with other city infrastructure, and not considered a luxury. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (2007) reported that ‘Health and wellbeing are recognised as inextricably linked with the urban environment’ – now we are faced with growing urban populations and the impact of climate change; well planned, designed and managed landscape and open space plays a central role in creating healthier and more resilient places for our urban citizens. We need a sea-change in the priority given to green space in our cities."
232,Social resilience builds truly smart cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/social-resilience-builds-truly-smart-cities,,"Across the world urban planners are adopting ‘Smart City’ initiatives, introducing digital technology into urban life to build efficiencies, support increased productivity and bolster the resilience of vital infrastructure, like energy or transport. But I am concerned that in this singular focus on technology and systems, Smart City initiatives are ignoring the social resilience that really keeps cities together. Social resilience can be thought of as the ability of individuals and groups within communities to cohesively re-organize and ultimately overcome the impacts of difficult situations and events. It’s clear to me that there’s little point in having a city that’s 'smart' but not socially resilient. So these two strands of thinking must be considered simultaneously to drive what we want technology to do for our cities and to make sure the smart economy reaches its full potential and can benefit everyone. Education is key. It lies at the heart of social resilience, and informs the coping, adaptive and transformative capacities of individuals and community groups. Water management education for example has improved the ability of community groups to cope with droughts in many geographies. However, where smart cities are concerned, education is almost exclusively centred on helping people acquire the skill-sets that will generate higher levels of individual productivity. Education must also mean improving people’s ability to support their communities on the often difficult road to change, providing access to services, cultivate environmental awareness and fostering social cohesion and solidarity. Take for example Songdo in South Korea where local schools have placed Internet connectivity at the heart of education through ‘Smart+ Connected’, a video-conferencing platform. This allows students to meet their peers in the USA and elsewhere and helps to expand their horizons, friendships and thinking from the earliest age. In a different example the Colombian city of Medellín suffered decades of social breakdown and violent crime. Inhabitants of the city’s poorest, and most far-flung hillside neighbourhoods used to face a two and a half hour walk into the city (if they bothered at all). But in 2004 a new Mayor decided all city investment should have a social dimension and within a year they’d commissioned and delivered a new cable car transit system which is a model of social cohesion in action. Suddenly the centre of the city was just 20 minutes away, job opportunities opened up and crime dropped. The cable car project has become a brilliant, and literal example of how to increase social mobility and cultivate a shared city experience through the application of technology. The conclusion is clear, to build truly resilient, truly smart and green cities we must always embrace the social potential of any project or investment."
233,Climate change: abandon coastal cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/climate-change-abandon-coastal-cities,,"Perhaps the most sensitive, heart-breaking, yet necessary action we will have to take in this next century is abandoning our coastal cities as climate change threatens their very existence. A study in the journal Nature shows that flooding could cost the world’s coastal cities more than $60bn per year in total by 2050. And that’s only if they take mitigation measures. If they do nothing, the cost could soar to $1tn per year. Research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) suggests a sea level rise of more than six feet by 2100. Looking further ahead to the most extreme case, National Geographic magazine recently examined what would happen if all the ice on Earth melted. It found that sea levels would rise by over 200 feet, wiping out the entire US Atlantic Seaboard along with London, Shanghai, Buenos Aires and many other major global cities. All the resilience measures in the world couldn’t prevent that scenario. But even a six foot sea level rise doesn’t seem to be a risk that people are prepared to think seriously about, despite the wake-up calls delivered by disasters like Katrina, Sandy and now Haiyan. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the Governor of New York State launched a scheme offering to buy back property in the most vulnerable areas at its pre-storm value. The response has been mixed; as many people would rather stay, try to rebuild stronger and take the risk. However, many experts believe that increasing insurance will drive residents away and keep potential home buyers out. As British futurist, James Martin recently noted, the climate change real estate boom is coming. For now, mitigation measures can certainly help us reduce those risks. Improved flood defences and beefed-up building codes will certainly buy coastal cities some time. Rolling Stone magazine featured an article titled ‘Goodbye, Miami’ painting a brutal yet real picture of the vulnerabilities South Florida cities faces. If the worst predictions for the effects of climate change come to pass, nothing will protect some coastal cities. So surely, it would make sense to abandon them (or segments of them) and start again somewhere inland, where the flood risk is lower. Abandoning cities is nothing new. Throughout history, cities have come and gone with the rise and fall of civilisations and changes in the environment. Ancient societies in Easter Island, Greenland and Central America could not have foreseen their collapse due to environmental reasons. More recently, cities have taken a downturn due to economic reasons, such as Detroit, whose population has declined by 60% since 1950. We didn’t see the recent global economic downturn coming or predict its impact on already-troubled Detroit. However, we do know that climate change and sea level rise is a forgone conclusion and that it will affect coastal cities in particular. So what can we do? Firstly, we have to continue protecting our coastal cities and their most critical housing and infrastructure assets, yet must also accept that we may eventually have to abandon some cities. Secondly, with this eventuality, we must start planning now – before nature forces our hand. As well as making existing cities resilient in the medium-term we have to consider whether a longer-term plan for new cities is needed – depending on the specific risk factors at each location. As the world’s population continues to urbanise, I think whether and when to abandon a city (particularly as cities continue to grow) will become an increasingly sensitive and pressing problem. It’s one we should start thinking about now."
234,Zero carbon buildings at zero cost,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/zero-carbon-buildings-at-zero-cost,,"When it comes to cutting carbon, current commercial building standards simply don’t go far enough. If we’re to escape catastrophic climate change, we need to embrace measures that will cut carbon to zero - without increasing costs. With countries such as China, Indonesia and Brazil striving for the West’s living standards and looking to adopt the green building standards as applied in the UK or US, carbon emissions are set to rise dramatically. In fact, given their current low energy use per person, it doesn’t take too many back-of-an-envelope calculations to show that we could expect 6ºC of climate change in this scenario. So what more can we do? Most importantly, for wide adoption, a step-change in building carbon emissions will only occur if it costs no more than business-as-usual. We can’t follow the model of BREEAM® or LEED where the assumption is that sustainability standards come with a cost premium affordable only by the most affluent. Instead, I’d like to propose ten steps that, when taken together as part of an integrated design, can deliver zero carbon buildings at zero cost. Smart IT - Designing offices around tablet computers instead of PCs on every desk would cut energy needs dramatically for both IT power needs and cooling energy use. LED task lighting - Rather than light the whole space to a high level irrespective of whether or not people are using it, adopting LED task lighting would more than half light energy use and likewise reduce the associated cooling energy demands. Daylight - Research shows that people are less likely to turn on lights if a room feels bright. So we should focus on designing for quality of daylighting rather than just the quantity brought into a building. Adaptive comfort - Giving people control over their environment – the lighting, air movement and heating – is proven to improve productivity and reduce energy consumption. Simple facades - Adopting modestly sized windows would help reverse the trend for complex and expensive facades that use a lot of materials. Passive cooling - Reducing the cooling demands of electrical equipment and solar gains enable the thermal mass of the building itself to provide much of its cooling passively – eliminating the need for much of the air conditioning and further cuts energy use. Small ‘M&E’ - Reducing demand on the mechanical and electrical systems means a building can have smaller, cheaper and more energy-efficient M&E equipment. Less material - With less space consuming M&E systems in the building, you can increase usable floor area, abolish the suspended ceiling, reduce storey heights and use less cladding material – all of which reduces the building costs. On-site or local renewables - With considerably lower energy consumption, it becomes much easier to meet a building’s energy needs from on-site or local renewables. Integrated design - These measures will only work if they’re taken together as part of an integrated design, rather than the pick-and-mix add-on approach of BREEAM® or LEED. Is this realistic? As a building designer, these measures seem relatively straightforward to me. The challenge will be leading the advocacy for change to both institutional standards and industry inertia. If we’re to change this and promote widespread adoption of zero carbon commercial buildings, then we in the industry must start speaking up. I intend to do so and I hope you’ll support me."
235,"Meanwhile use, long term benefit",https://www.arup.com/perspectives/meanwhile-use-long-term-benefit,,"‘Meanwhile use’ is a catch-all title adopted in recent years to describe a diverse range of pop-up cafés, shops and temporary uses of empty property and land. Often described as a response to a moribund economic climate, I believe that temporary, flexible and interchangeable uses should be seen as part of the normal response to regeneration. The value of temporary uses has been recognised across the property and regeneration industry, not least as a stop-gap for longer-term regeneration and development proposals. Take London’s Boxpark, for example, now celebrating its tenth anniversary following ongoing delays to the site’s permanent redevelopment. It provides the opportunity for early wins by quickly bringing life and activity to an area before permanent development begins. Similarly, it can enable continuity during redevelopment, such as the Ebury Edge project, which provides a community heart for the Ebury Bridge Estate while it transitions through full redevelopment. The concept of ‘meanwhile use’ doesn’t need to be limited to very short-term interventions. For the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, interim uses of up to ten years have been utilised to animate and activate central parts of the park before the construction of phased residential development commences. As part of Arup’s work with James Corner Field Operations on the transformation of the Olympic Park, we successfully obtained permission for a range of event and exhibition spaces at the South Lawn that had a planned life of up to five years. More immediate urban challenges can also be addressed. The Re:START development in Christchurch, New Zealand, provided a temporary replacement shopping core for the city, helping it get back on its feet following the 2011 earthquake. ‘Meanwhile use’ acts as a prototype of the character that a new or reformed piece of a city may develop, ensuring early understanding of it as a place. This has the double benefit of providing an interim income stream while also enhancing the attractiveness of a place to potential future tenants. What’s more, businesses may also flourish and provide readymade tenants that can migrate into permanent space over time. The UK Government, in response to an increase in empty property, has continued to seek relaxations under the Use Classes Order, providing the ability to change more easily between property uses. This aims to have the effect of lowering barriers to start-up enterprises by providing flexibility in how property is used. The success of this change relies on occupiers being happy to trade from more unusual space and landlords being willing to take a pragmatic approach to new business concepts. The challenge may be securing a legacy from these transitory investments and maintaining a supply of space that presents these opportunities. View Tube, on the edge of the Olympic Park, demonstrates how a limited initial investment can pay dividends. Developed as a temporary café and education resource to engage the community in the development of the London 2012 Olympic Park, its commercial success combined with the limited alternative uses for the site has seen its temporary stay extended indefinitely. As part of this process, developers will want to secure and promote the future development potential of sites in parallel with interim uses so that the transition to a permanent development is less likely to be met with resistance from the community. By adopting a more pragmatic, collaborative approach, landlords, occupiers and authorities can reach a successful understanding of the potential benefits of ‘meanwhile use’. In my view, its value has been well demonstrated, and all long-term development and regeneration proposals would do well to develop ‘meanwhile use’ strategies. This is a fact now well recognised and clearly articulated in Arup’s work on behalf of the GLA’ Meanwhile Use for London’."
236,Going underground: using cities' hidden space,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/going-underground,,"Developing underground is an increasingly attractive and economically viable option for crowded cities. In high-density urban areas, pressure for space is sparking interest in building downwards as well as upwards. Cities including Hong Kong, Singapore and Helsinki are all looking seriously into or have already developed masterplans for underground development. Helsinki has already hollowed out space for 400 facilities including a wastewater treatment plant, a swimming pool and a running track. Its masterplan identifies over 100 new locations for rock construction. In Hong Kong, Arup helped the Government look at how to enhance the use of underground space and the city is now going ahead with plans to move the Sha Tin sewage treatment works to underground caverns. This will free up valuable above ground waterfront land to be redeveloped for other uses and remove an environmental nuisance for local people. For the private sector, going underground represents an opportunity to ensure business continuity. Spiralling demand for land above ground in crowded cities makes buying property expensive and puts landlords in the driving seat when businesses are looking to lease space. In Hong Kong, these pressures mean leases are often short and expensive – making it difficult to plan for the future. So businesses find the underground option particularly attractive for applications like data centres, as it could provide a secure, long-term home. With society depending more and more on the internet, keeping the data that flows through it safe is an important consideration. Build a data centre below ground and it will be shielded from cosmic rays and electromagnetic interference – as well as from potential terrorist attacks. Going underground also provides a more stable temperature. So in Hong Kong’s hot and humid climate, underground facilities would avoid summer peaks and save on cooling. In more northerly latitudes it would help avoid the harshest conditions of winter. How can cities go about taking advantage of the space beneath their streets? Favourable geology helps. In Helsinki’s case, bedrock is hard and near the surface. Suitable terrain is also an advantage. Hong Kong benefits from having steep terrain as well as good strong rocks making it relatively straightforward to tunnel into the hillsides. However, carving rock caverns from mountains or bedrock is not the only way forward. Cities like Toronto and Montreal, to name a few, have taken the interconnectivity offered by their existing metro systems and expanded it to connect basements with labyrinths of passageways and subways. In Japan and Korea, you’ll find underground connected shopping malls that keep people off the roads and in stable comfortable environments. Developing below ground isn’t a new idea. In the past, people have built underground when times were difficult or conditions were harsh. Today, these spaces offer us opportunities to address the very different challenges our dense urban spaces face."
237,Would the Pompidou get built today?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/would-the-pompidou-get-built-today,,"Technology may have moved on since the 1970s, but there’s still a lot we can learn from the focused and bold approach to building the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Frankly, I think today in Europe we’d struggle to match the timescale in which the project was designed and built. The design competition was held in June 1971 and the centre opened in the first few days of 1977. For an incredibly complex and innovative building, this is an amazingly short timescale. So how was it done? It started with the French government taking a risk on architects who were then young and unknown: Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers. Piano was 34 when he won the Centre Pompidou competition and he was still in his 30s when the building was completed. I don’t think a national government would put its faith in such a young team today. In fact, in our checklist-driven, bureaucratic world, I doubt they’d even make it through pre-qualification. With the industry now much more risk-averse than in those days – particularly public sector clients – many inspirational projects probably fall unnoticed at this first hurdle. As it was, the young, hard-working design team, which included Arup’s Peter Rice, came together in Paris and worked together in an office near the site. This hothouse environment enabled them to push the design on quickly. For large international projects today, teams can be spread around the world. Inevitably, communication is not as slick. I think there’s also a tendency to over-analyse, spending too long trying to get the last 1% of structural efficiency. In a previous post on Thoughts, Martin Manning asked if we designed better buildings before we had computers. I’d say that we often use the computing tools we have today to prevaricate rather than make decisions. Computers don’t necessarily lead to efficiencies but had we used today’s tools on the Centre Pompidou, we might have gained some marginal improvement. We might have been able to design the same building with 10% less steel or 10% less mechanical equipment, for example. The real difference between then and now is the context in which we’re working. One of the most innovative elements of the Centre Pompidou – using water-filled structural steel columns to provide fire protection – was born out of necessity. At that time, the French authorities insisted on a code-compliant design. Today they’d be open to less complex solutions if calculations showed they were safe. However, authorities today would also require the building to be much more energy-efficient. Placing building services on the outside gives the Centre Pompidou its iconic ‘inside out’ form and opens up space inside but it also creates a vast number of cold bridges where heat can get out. There’s also another reason why we’d think long and hard about putting all the mechanical and electrical systems on the outside of a building today: it is much harder to keep them in good condition when they’re exposed to the elements. In any case, the architectural agenda has also moved on. The legibility of the Centre Pompidou – the way you can read the building’s engineering in its architecture – or similarly the Lloyd’s of London building is not repeated in today’s iconic projects. For some engineers, the Centre Pompidou and Lloyd’s of London were the golden age – when engineering design was central to building form and their work was on show to the world. But times change and today there is a new set of agendas to understand, for example in the way buildings can aid social interaction. As engineers, it’s down to us to understand and respond to these agendas just as creatively, effectively and innovatively as the people who designed the Centre Pompidou did to the challenge they set themselves."
238,Building for earthquake resilience,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/building-for-earthquake-resilience,,"Base isolation is seismic engineering’s equivalent of seatbelts in cars – and maybe more: it’s a lifesaver and possibly a property saver. That’s why I believe base isolation needs to be made a legal requirement for most new non high-rise buildings in areas at risk from earthquakes. Base isolating a building is an engineering technique that places bearings between a building and the ground to reduce seismic vibrations. This minimises damage by significantly reducing the forces experienced during an earthquake. The system is already used in countries like the US and Japan to protect historic buildings and vital infrastructure such as bridges and airports. The Space Shuttle Endeavour is protected by base isolation at the California Science Center, while Turkey’s Sahiba Gökçen International Airport is the largest seismically isolated building in the world. However, base isolation could, and should, be applied much more widely. The Space Shuttle Endeavour is protected by base isolation at the California Science Center To view this video, you must enable cookies. Base isolation is effective on short, stiff structures – most residential units around the world fall into this category. So if it was to be made compulsory in areas of seismic risk, the market would quickly develop to help drive down the cost of the systems and millions of people would benefit. From a financial perspective, base isolation helps reduce rebuilding costs after earthquakes and minimises lifecycle cost. It also minimises the cost of damage to building contents. Plus, it could enable buildings to be used without interruption during a seismic event. By not protecting buildings in this way, we risk paying a high price. I’ve seen the devastating human and economic impact of earthquakes first-hand in Pakistan and Haiti. Less developed countries may not have the expertise or resources to implement base isolation, but there’s no reason why richer seismically active countries such as China, Turkey and India shouldn’t adopt it. What’s more, this isn’t just about reducing loss of life and devastation such as that caused by the Christchurch earthquake in 2011 or in Iran this week. Base isolation could eliminate much of the damage caused by smaller earthquakes, reducing the costs incurred and making homes and communities more resilient. So why isn’t the engineering community calling for base isolation to be mandatory? I think one reason is that earthquake engineering is often perceived as a specialist design activity. As a result, it’s also perceived to add capital cost to projects without any consideration being given to the huge damage to property in an earthquake. In many countries where it’s still an emerging discipline, civil and structural engineers are not routinely taught about structural dynamics and earthquake engineering. To me, that’s like going to medical school and not learning about antibiotics. I think that base isolation should become the new norm, just as cars come with seatbelts. Engineers are the custodians of the built environment and we have a responsibility to make sure that the environment is healthy, robust and resilient. As part of this, we must have the courage to push for laws requiring all buildings in areas of seismic risk to be earthquake resistant. Making base isolation the norm through appropriate legislation will take us one step closer to having resilient homes, communities and cities."
239,We need agile cities,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/we-need-agile-cities,,"If we are to make cities work for people in the future, to enable economic growth without depleting resources, they must be agile – embracing small-scale infrastructure and remaining flexible. In part, this requires thinking small. One great example of ‘small is beautiful’ is the growing shift to small-scale distributed infrastructure like tri-generation and grey water recycling. Both are significant ways to reduce losses of energy and water – they’re smarter and more sustainable ways to build a city. As well as thinking small, we need to look at the bigger picture and ask ourselves where we want to be. Without an agreed map of the territory ahead, and in the absence of clear signposts, it is difficult for those steering our way into the future - and even harder for those following - to have faith that we’ll end up where we want to be. For this reason I believe urban agility should be a core tenet of our design approach for cities. For most of us, the infrastructure we are creating will easily outlast us. We can never see into the future, so what we create today must be adaptable tomorrow. Good design can help us meet the needs of our communities today and create different paths for infrastructure to evolve in the future. It means thinking more Legoland® than Disneyland® - exploring smaller, modular components of infrastructure that can be easily re-configured for different uses. I think the ability to re-configure and recycle suburbs and precincts to meet changing social, demographic, economic, environmental, and climactic needs is critical to delivering the resilient, flexible, affordable infrastructure we require. I believe we need three things to improve our chances of making this happen. We need better data. We need better models. And we need to build relationships. There’s no substitute for good, hard data when it comes to making decisions. We need to know more about what people want, what they value, and how our cities and infrastructure are performing. But I think we'll be waiting a while before we see a model that offers us a complete picture of why our cities work the way they do, and shows us how they can work differently in future. So, what do we do in the meantime? That’s where better relationships come in. Building better relationships will support data sharing across agencies and businesses. And building stronger trust among design, engineering and other specialist disciplines is critical to developing truly integrated city-scale models, of which there is no single owner. Trust and relationships are also critical to any process of change, counteracting the ‘not in my backyard’ response to proposals for new developments or infrastructure. Strong trust can help us develop urban agility, by enabling people to embrace change, rather than instinctively oppose it. So let's stop meekly accepting the outputs of our democratic processes, and start demanding a meritocracy of ideas. I guess this is what all good activists demand, and I’d love to hear what you think we should be arguing for."
240,Responsive façades for smarter cities ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/responsive-facades-for-smarter-cities,,"A greener future’s not all about electric cars; it’s about smart building engineering too. Facades are the screen wall of cities: put simply, things hang from them. But what kind of smart technologies will we hang from facades in our new, smarter cities? I believe it won’t be smart phones or social media. Despite the hype, I don’t think it will be LED screens either. Here are my predictions for the facades of the future. First there’s the glazed part Imagine a window glass that can modify the wavelength of solar radiation, transforming ultraviolet into visible rays. The result would be more natural light all year round. A glass with a higher light transmission and dynamic solar control: now that’s something to invest in. Glass, either double or triple glazed, is always worse than an opaque wall in terms of thermal insulation – ten times worse as a rule of thumb. So imagine a new glass pane with a U-value of 0.4W/m2ºK – a rate of heat loss just twice as much as an efficient opaque wall. Two competing technologies are almost there: closed cavity over-pressurized glass (quadruple glazed and thick for curtain walling) and vacuum insulated glass (double glazed and thin for residential windows). Then there’s the opaque part The first goal here is to improve thermal mass while reducing weight and depth. This will need cheap (not there yet) phase change particles embedded in thin plasterboard. Or with exposed, very efficient concrete located at ceiling level. The target? Lightweight, prefabricated, opaque facades that are easy to install and to reuse and that behave thermally as heavy massive walls. We only have to cross the cost threshold, and we can do that using existing materials and aggregates. And finally, there’s the dynamic or responsive concept This is the new strong idea. Why should we only live in highly passive but fenced cells all year round? Envelopes should be capable of storing, filtering and redirecting thermal, light and air flows – not just acting as barriers to them – according to the conditions inside and outside the building. Imagine a facade with a variable U-value, so that energy flows out when inner heat is excessive. One way this can be done is with blown fibre insulation, modified with spray-applied microencapsulated phase change materials. The trick here is finding dynamic responses that are simple to implement and to maintain. We already have the technology and we can harvest the data to fine-tune our envelopes for a better response in a dynamic environment. Simulation and measuring should go hand-in-hand to avoid mistakes, but the result will be a higher level of comfort and reduced energy use. This isn’t just a list of gadgets. Some of my predictions might be wrong in the detail but hopefully not in their approach — responsive building envelopes. This will see smart, simple to manage facades improving our buildings and helping create leaner neighbourhoods and smarter cities. It has to, because it’s something we owe to the next generation."
241,Timber mushrooms revive market square,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/timber-mushrooms-revive-market-square,,"The spectacular Metropol Parasol in Seville’s Plaza De La Encarnación was the result of more than seven years’ work. Its six mushroom-like parasols have now turned an isolated market square into a new neighbourhood for Seville. And, for me, the project exemplifies how architects and engineers can collaborate to deliver transformational projects. As you might expect, building a timber mega-structure to shade the plaza and protect an archaeological site was technically challenging. We worked with a new combination of materials and a specially developed timber connection detail. However, much more important was the collaborative effort required for a project that has to meet the needs of so many users. (The Parasol has to cater for everyone from market stallholders to archaeologists to the city authorities.) The timber structure itself is a sculptural, and at the same time engineered design. So we had to work hand-in-hand with the architect, Jürgen Mayer. And with the project team made up of at least three different nationalities, good communication was particularly important. As you can imagine, there are certainly challenging times on a project like this. But when you see the market stallholders – who endured 35 years in temporary conditions – thrilled to finally have a new place to practise their trades, it’s all worthwhile. The cafe on the square where I always went for breakfast before site meetings has undergone a huge change: from a dark little hole behind the temporary hoarding to a bright and welcoming café. And, of course, the nicest feeling for me now is to simply meander across the open and bright square. It’s great to watch the neighbours and the growing number of tourists enjoying the fresh air, relaxing in the shade or simply relishing the atmosphere of the new public square."
242,What's the future for arts venues?,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/whats-the-future-for-arts-venues,,"Chairing a recent debate at the Barbican in London, I asked how arts venues should be designed for an uncertain future. It seems to me that someone visiting us from the late 19th century would feel at home in today’s arts buildings. But these venues will have to change if they are to remain affordable and sustainable, and to keep attracting audiences. One question is whether society can afford landmark arts venues – or, conversely, whether we can afford not to have them. If we focus on making venues affordable by designing cheaper buildings or by programming only events that are guaranteed to sell out, will our culture lose its cutting edge? Will philanthropists still support art in these kinds of venues? It seems to me that we may need to radically rethink where people go to watch, interact with, and take part in the arts. Would temporary venues entice younger audiences put off by formal settings? We now have post offices and police stations in supermarkets – so why not arts venues too? We might not see this happen just yet but there are other ways to make the most of venues. Cross-arts programming offers the opportunity to make them more sustainable, by reducing staffing costs and generating other income. For example, Kings Place in London combines visual and performing arts with commercial office space. And the Corby Cube combines performing arts and library facilities. Crucially, arts venues will also have to respond to changing audiences. I attended my first classical music concert over 40 years ago. Then, I was the youngest person there. Today, I’m still younger than 90% of the audience! Younger people want venues that enable them to interact and participate. So why is the Sage Gateshead the only major UK performance venue that contains a music school? These are just some of the questions we need to address. What do you think the venue of the future will look like?"
243,Systems thinking can make cities work for people,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/systems-thinking-can-make-cities-work-for-people,,"Like many countries, Australia is becoming increasingly urban. Here, 90% of us now work in cities. But how do we make our cities work for people? I believe 'systems thinking' holds the key. Understanding a city as a whole and finding pathways to more sustainable futures means integrating urban design, strategic thinking, economic analysis and engineering knowledge. It requires an appreciation of the complex interactions between different urban systems – everything from transport networks to social networks. Crucially, we must consider the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ elements of city systems, and how they exist and interact.Too often we think only in terms of hard systems that have easily quantifiable elements. A new rail line can reduce journey times, but how do we measure the impact of hard-to-quantify elements of the city system, such as community engagement, multi-cultural diversity or precinct livability? To do this, we need to reframe what we mean by infrastructure and how we deliver it – we need systems thinking. This demands informed dialogue between government, developers and communities. After all, perhaps there are good reasons to invest in more cycleways, wi-fi hotspots and informatics, rather than trying to mend our ailing road networks. With the benefit of emerging informatics solutions, people will be able to engage ever more deeply with their environment at home or in the office. For example, they could adjust their energy use or travel plans in response to real-time feedback on the potential carbon emissions involved. We don’t know everything the future will hold. But we do know that the next generation will have different expectations of their city and what it ought to offer. And we think meeting those expectations demands the kind of systems thinking that is already gaining traction in industries such as healthcare, energy distribution and biotechnology. We’re applying this approach in our UrbanLife workshops with the C40, a group of 40 of the world’s largest cities committed to tackling climate change. The workshops address specific issue faced by cities, resulting in a strategic plan for action. Do you think this systems focus make sense for our cities? I’d love to hear your thoughts."

The use of organic waste and its untapped value could have a positive impact on the environment as well as technical, social and economic standpoints. In the urban bio-loop, we identify a number of organic waste streams, together with their applications in building construction as products. These provide guidelines for designers and practitioners in replacing some of the traditional architectural products with equivalents made with organic waste as a resource. We explore how both our cities and urban districts could become self-sustaining through the active implementation of organic waste streams into the supply chain of building construction products. Our vision entails cities and urban districts that could implement more effective recovery systems and processes to turn organic waste into a source of value, while planning for growing natural construction materials - key principles of the circular economy.

This shift in the design and manufacture of goods is not the result of a single trend, but is driven by a broad range of complex and interconnected factors. These influences range from advances in digital technologies and automation to climate change and market demands. The collective consequence is a shift towards design and innovation processes that are increasingly fast, open, collaborative and responsive. As the world of manufacturing changes, the way factories are planned, constructed and operated will also change. They will need to become more flexible and adaptable, achieve better integration between buildings and processes, and be more resilient to economic and environmental shifts. Future factories will have to operate at higher material and energy efficiencies, while providing safe and healthy working conditions for an increasingly skilled and diverse workforce.

Better Decisions is the first output of a pilot study led by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, funded by Novo Nordisk and undertaken by Arup. It comprises an in-depth exploration of approaches to measuring the benefits of climate action across multiple domains – including social, economic, financial and environmental. Earlier work by C40 and Arup found that one of the greatest challenges preventing cities from accelerating and expanding their action on climate change is a difficulty in articulating a persuasive case for investment. Yet climate actions frequently respond to many other city priorities, from economic growth and job creation, to improved health outcomes. Better Decisions seeks to develop a simple and replicable methodology by which C40 cities can measure and communicate the wide-ranging benefits of climate actions. This first report focuses on the benefits of three climate actions currently underway in Mexico City – the development of cycle lanes; establishment of a bike share programme; and the designation of pedestrian zones. By combining the city’s own data with benchmarks from other cities, it is possible to build a comprehensive picture of benefits. Key findings include: The potential net present benefits of Mexico City’s bike lanes are $65 million, outweighing the costs by more than 5 times. 	 An average bike share user spends up to 82 minutes per week cycling – as much as 55% of the recommended weekly activity to maintain a healthy weight. 	 Reported crime along the city’s pedestrianised avenue has decreased by around 96% since the pedestrianisation project. The study shows that data collection and management in cities could be significantly enhanced to facilitate more accurate measurement of benefits related to specific projects and programmes, but valuable insights can be gained through benchmarking. The study calls for cities, private businesses and researchers to share data to create a stronger evidence base for the benefits of climate action. Better Decisions Download"

Powering Climate Action explores the powers that cities hold over urban assets and functions, which may help them to implement climate actions. The report highlights the types of urban climate governance that prevail in cities, and presents a pathway to city-led climate action that takes into account political context, governance structure and potential delivery routes and partners. We analysed data from 66 cities in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40). Within this data, we identified typical power profiles that cities hold across 10 sectors, including transport, energy supply and water. We also observed a series of governance typologies that describe cities’ approaches to climate governance. Our report illustrates contrasting power profiles and governance models in cities from across the globe, but also commonalities that highlight great potential for knowledge sharing between cities. Our research indicates that cities are in a strong position to catalyse climate action, particularly in cases where they collaborate with other actors. Our report is the first product of a three year global partnership between Arup and C40. Together, we hope cities, their partners and the wider community will receive this report as a firm call to action, to collaborate and move forward together to deliver the transformative action that is needed so urgently.

The historic agreement made at CoP21 in Paris committed signatories to “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.” What does this mean for Cities? Deadline 2020: How cities will get the job done provides an analysis of the contribution that the 84 global C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) cities need to make to convert the agreement from aspiration into reality. C40 cities need to reduce emissions from an annual average of above 5 tCO2e per citizen today to around 2.9 tCO2e per citizen by 2030. We are short on time. The next four years are critical if we want to halt the growth of emissions. Cities need to be bold and make decisions now, but they cannot do it alone. Taking action will require approximately $375 billion in investment by national governments and the private sector over the next four years. Sharing this investment will transform and improve entire economies, creating jobs, bolstering infrastructure, and improving public health. Through this action and investment, we have the opportunity to deliver climate-ready cities that are efficient, resilient and liveable. Deadline 2020 provides concrete steps for cities to meet their part of this objective, offering a roadmap of actions. Key recommendations include: The need to ramp up action Greater opportunity for the buildings and transit sectors Smart urban planning can make all the difference Partnerships and collaboration will be key The report has been delivered by Arup alongside C40 as part of a collaborative partnership. Together we are developing strategic analysis and research which is central to progressing our understanding of how cities can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Deadline 2020 update: April 2018 Arup would like to raise attention to an error in the Deadline 2020: How cities will get the job done report. The majority of the core recommendations and findings of the work remain valid, and the impact of the error is less significant over the first 10-15 years of projections, which is the focal point for this work. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is therefore still encouraging cities, partners and all urban stakeholders to make good use of the work, with the following caution in mind. The identified issue is around the GDP growth projections that the analysis was based on. This has led to an over-estimation of the ""business as usual"" emissions trajectories in the report, as well as the long-term absolute savings figures. We therefore caution that these specific numbers should not be referenced directly. However, the analysis remains useful for its main intended purpose, which is outlining the urgency with which action is needed, and guiding urban policy makers on the level of ambition and key priority areas for climate action in the short term. C40 and Arup will rectify these numbers in due course, and we are excited to be able to say that a follow up piece of research is underway. Through this work many of the Deadline 2020 numbers will be updated, and a whole raft of methodological enhancements made to further refine their accuracy. This work will be published in 2019. This issue has not impacted on any C40 climate action planning work undertaken subsequent to the release of Deadline 2020, which has relied on more bespoke emissions baselines.

The project was the brainchild of Andrew Duncan, a mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) BIM Manager, and Casey Rutland, BIM specialist and Associate Director at Arup. Their team worked around the clock for seven weeks to make ProjectOVE a reality. What started as an internal research and development project became a tool for the whole industry to learn from – the most exciting development yet in BIM technology. Virtually human: Creating ProjectOVE Have you ever thought that the ducts and pipes of a building are a lot like the veins and nerves of a human body? This innocent observation sparked an idea that has grown into one of the industry’s most talked about innovations: ProjectOVE. Our team used BIM to design a 170m tall, 35-storey building in the shape of a real human body, replicating its inner workings as accurately as possible. What developed over the following weeks has changed the process of building engineering forever. ProjectOVE: Human body systems The team wanted to create a multidisciplinary model comprising architecture, structure and MEP, correlating as closely as possible to the human anatomy. They replicated five major human body systems: Respiratory: mechanical ductwork Circulatory: mechanical pipework Nervous: electrical Skeletal: structure Intergumentary: architecture The initial model took just seven weeks to complete and is very much a work in progress. A future ProjectOVE 2.0 would consider: Altering the position of the structure to offer more versatility Incorporate the digestive system with an energy centre Include the thermoregulatory system through public health (including fire sprinklers) Add a transport hub and much more ProjectOVE: Specifications 35 storeys 170m tall 38.64kW of light: 148.54lm from 483 luminaires 168 radiators Brain data centre: 360m2 “ We wanted to demonstrate that we can create any geometry using BIM and make it work. For MEP, people have been quite shocked at what data you can put into the tool, what calculations you can automate and how much time you can save. ” The future of BIM: How ProjectOVE is raising industry standards Originally conceived for internal research and development, Project Ove has exceeded everyone’s expectations and has demonstrated the staggering possibilities of modern engineering. The team estimate that the processes they created using six different software packages saved up to 3 hours of manual calculation time for every structural and MEP change. The model has also proved a captivating tool in schools, inspiring the next generation of architects and engineers. And it’s at the heart of our collaborative approach to BIM.

As cities become increasingly complex places, it’s becoming more important for citizens to join professionals in ‘talking city’ and planning for their future. Why? Because for plans to succeed they need to have collective buy-in and to reflect the multiplicity of stakeholder views. However, plan making is often a legal process and complying with it can stifle innovation in engaging people and developing ideas. So how, in an age of fluid social constructs, increased mobility, instant messaging and rapid change, do we truly engage people in the plans that will shape their future? One tool that can help cities access different voices in an inclusive and participatory way is the charrette. Whilst historically the tool of choice for architects, I believe this can be re-focused and used to plan cities. A charrette is an intensive, often multi-day planning session where citizens, planners, and others collaborate to develop a vision for future development. It is a flexible tool, which can bring people together to talk about the future of places which are important to them, build consensus from a range of perspectives and empower people to develop proposals.

273,Driving the new economy: how smart cities are preparing Vietnam for the future ,https://www.arup.com/perspectives/driving-the-new-economy-how-smart-cities-are-preparing-vietnam-for-the-future,,"In fast growing economies, the nature of growth can present policy makers with complex challenges. In Vietnam, urbanisation has grown from 25% to 33% in under twenty years. Factors like these are putting growing pressure on city services, transport systems and mobility, causing quality of life issues and increasing the need for wider economic opportunity. In Vietnam, ‘smart city’ projects are informing and shaping the country’s response to many different priorities. From resource management to urban mobility, government services and environmental issues, digital innovation is seen as playing a central and valuable role in shaping successful national development. Arup’s own work developing a Smart City Handbook for Vietnam, for the UK Government’s Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office in 2021, offers something of an aerial view of how smart city projects, in all their various forms, can be coordinated to national effect. This article reflects ideas and experiences discussed in a December 2021 conversation between Sam Wood, UK Deputy Consul to Vietnam and part of the FCDO, Arup’s Brice Richard, Australasia Strategy Leader, and Devni Acharya, Climate Change Consultant. We spoke to Sam to discuss how digital innovation can be implemented, to become an economic driver that can enhance cities’ liveability, workability, and sustainability. Build the infrastructure We already know that digital innovation boosts competitiveness, efficiency, and opens up new markets. At the national level this amounts to a certain kind of signalling too and it starts to reshape and grow the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) a country receives. Vietnam is clearly attempting to develop a broader footprint in the digital, knowledge economy. As Sam Wood, UK Deputy Consul-General in Vietnam observes, “Vietnam has benefited over the last few decades from being an attractive hub for low cost competitive manufacturing, but that won't sustain economic growth in the next few decades. It will be more about innovation, about access to high tech, about access to clean growth, and access to renewable energy.” What are investors looking for? It starts with strong digital infrastructure and connectivity – fast, affordable and reliable wi-fi and 5G – that reaches all communities within a country. It means embracing the idea of open data and shared platforms, providing innovators with access to information that can drive new services in the urban environment, from entertainment to travel to healthcare. (On the latter element, the experience of the pandemic has clearly a major spur to health-tech innovation). Figure: Smart city initiatives are among today’s most powerful economic drivers and the most efficient way to tackle the interconnected threats of climate change. “ Vietnam has benefitted from low cost, competitive manufacturing, but that won't sustain economic growth… It will be more about innovation. ” Sam Wood UK Deputy Consul-General and Head of Trade & Investment, Ho Chi Minh City Coordinate for greater impact Ultimately, consistency and national coordination, of what are often locally led initiatives, are key to achieving real change though. The digital economy is inherently both continuously evolving and unpredictable, challenging decision makers to make bets about the future. As Sam Wood sees it, “tech is often an area where the private sector and innovation, frankly, outstrip the policy agenda from government. So I think one of the challenges for the ministries here will be keeping up with the pace of private sector change and the level of innovation that's already underway.” With new technology, change is user or behaviourally driven, something decision makers need to stay aware of as they shape future development. As Sam sees it, “it’s something we need to capitalise on, by making sure that urban planning properly integrates digital solutions and reflects people’s preferences and needs. We’re seeing it on smart city projects here in Ho Chi Minh City, including an ‘ask’ to international partners for digital solutions within the city planning process.” In 2017, Ho Chi Minh City’s people’s committee committed to a smart city plan that will lead to investments in cloud and digital infrastructure, data centre development, and an open data initiative. With these in place it’s hoped the city can tackle issues like improving e-government, environmental priorities, flood control and urban ‘liveability’ in a more joined up way by 2030. ‘Smart’ must mean inclusive In the last few years, digital services have proliferated even in once highly analogue sectors, from property to banking to education and now healthcare. This breadth of innovation, coupled by the relative affordability of technologies like smart phones, has both reinvigorated the smart city agenda and its sense of purpose, yet also presented new challenges. Sam Wood identifies inclusivity as a key concern though. “In Vietnam we want to make sure that it isn’t just cities and their urban populations that are gaining access to new digital services and the benefits that flow from them. It’s vital that rural areas and communities are not disadvantaged. For example, throughout the pandemic it was clear that certain communities had better access to services like online education. So as we shape future projects, ensuring inclusivity and access will be key.” Vietnam has been an incredible developmental success story in the last few decades. It has maintained high growth and embraced innovation, with an openness to partnerships between state and private sector, national and international partners. Smart cities thrive on these connections, building working relationships between civil society, private enterprise, academia and government bodies. As Arup’s work on the Smart Cities Handbook for Vietnam has shown, the growing power of digital offers administrators, innovators and investors with an unparalleled opportunity to make big change happen, to the benefit of everyone. More about smart cities and Vietnam In a related perspective Devni Acharya, Climate Change Consultant, focuses on how smart city projects are proving a vital tool for nations facing the growing threat of climate change.
