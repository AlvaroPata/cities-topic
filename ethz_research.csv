0,Circular Future Cities,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/circular-future-cities.html,,"Global construction material demand has more than doubled in the last 20 years and is projected to increase further. The resulting substantial increase in grey energy and material-related environmental impact is more than the planet can sustainably bear. Therefore, a transition to a circular economy, in which used materials may become valuable resources for a new production cycle, is urgently needed. 'Circular construction' represents a paradigm shift from current construction practice, which requires changes and innovations throughout the entire existing socio-technical system. Singular technological solutions are often met with challenges, since they rely on other innovations that have yet to be developed. This can be overcome by adopting a systemic approach that integrates key research themes and jointly developed solutions.
This module aims to develop integrated frameworks and tools based on advanced digital technology for informing the design of circular buildings and deploying more effective resource solutions. This research project is in line with the overall goal of the global proposal to make interdependencies between cities and their hinterlands more sustainable and beneficial for citizens, as primary material resources typically come from the hinterland where they cause environmental impacts, while circularity draws on sustainable (often local) solutions. The focus lies on providing decision recommendations for building-material choices, construction and ‘circular’ design. This project strives to develop integrated frameworks and tools based on advanced digital technology for informing design and deploying effective resource solutions. It will also provide business models and policy recommendations for ‘circular’ housing.
Proposed solutions shall be tailored to the local context both within city boundaries as well as the hinterland that provides the material and energetic resources. Various types of settlements will be addressed, Polycentric Settlement Networks and Concentrated Global Cities. The research is structured into six that are conducted in an iterative way, informing one another. WP 1 will map resources in the building stock in a spatially and temporally resolved manner, identify environmental hotspots for each case study, and analyse current policies, enablers and barriers for circular materials.
WP 2 will build on this mapping and provide a location-specific catalogue of circular materials documenting the main technical properties and life-cycle environmental performance. The local availability of renewable resources for circular materials will be assessed.
WP 3 will integrate the technical and environmental solutions developed in the theme 2 into an effective Circular Economy value chain.
WP 4 will provide a data platform to create digital building assets by securitising building data over the long-term, allowing markets and an ecosystem of related services to emerge.
WP 5 will develop Circular Economy Potential, a design evaluation model that integrates output from other Themes within a framework for design (for disassembly); this framework will be showcased by developing a catalogue of CE-approved building elements. The core of CEP is a functional assembly model that works in any constructional context; its settings (weighting) and life-cycle data depend on the local context (Switzerland and Singapore).”
WP 6 will act as a synthesis where findings from previous themes are iteratively consolidated through stakeholder workshops. This also will enable feedback from stakeholders on how institutional governance structures need to change. The final outcome will be to provide finalised future scenarios and policy recommendations that can be put in place by governmental authorities and industry professionals. The project team consists of civil and environmental engineers, material scientists, architects, urban designers, and computer scientists, who will collaborate closely to develop a joint modelling framework and digital platform to inform the design of sustainable housing. The project will focus on Singapore and Switzerland as case studies and address various settlement systems, in particular polycentric networks and concentrated global cities. We will follow an inter- and transdisciplinary systems approach to inform the design of sustainable housing that allows circular material flows in urban areas. Future Cities Lab Global

1,Powering the City,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/powering-the-city.html,,"Globally, 80% of energy is consumed primarily in urban areas today, due to urbanisation. The transition towards renewable energy systems to power future low-carbon cities is crucial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating global warming, as well as increasing liveability in cities. 

 Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) offers renewable energy to be generated on-site and prevents additional sealing of natural ground, potentially replacing traditional building elements. Switching from centralised, fossil-fuelled to decentralised and renewable electricity generation, however, also redefines the relation of cities to their hinterland with respect to energy. Current developments in technology, aesthetics as well as decreasing costs provide the grounds for mass deployment of BIPV in urban settings to optimise the use of solar energy, for both building retrofit by replacing traditional building facade elements and in new developments.
The objective of the Powering the City module is to develop a holistic, multi-scale and interdisciplinary approach for assessing large scale deployment of BIPV in urban contexts under different climatic, socio-economic and architectural / urban conditions. The team will use Zurich and Singapore as exemplary and complementary case studies.  
The following research questions will be investigated:

How can, on existing buildings, both building retrofit potentials and solar yield be estimated realistically, taking into account the urban context?
How can the utilization of solar electricity be maximized (self-consumption) by sharing, heat/cold generation and storage (sector coupling)?
What are localized (BIPV) envelope construction systems (retrofits and new constructions; heating context Zurich and cooling context Singapore) that balance embodied vs. operational emissions.
What are aesthetic / urban design implications of maximizing solar production in existing contexts?
What are economic drivers and barriers to push solar retrofit, what are interactions between city and hinterland?


Investigating these research questions will lead to following deliverables:

Data-driven, contextual models for demand assessment (including occupant and mobility behavior),
Engineering models for BIPV integration and assessment (LCA, cost, architectural/urban design),
User studies on social acceptance and the impact of energy policies (e.g., nudges) on user behavior,
Toolboxes for the generation and assessment of BIPV systems (including sector coupling: thermal, electricity and mobility) of urban blocks and districts, and
Application of the toolboxes and models to case studies (retrofitting and brown field).


Being project partners, the team will interact with public stakeholders and agencies to provide feedback and to be trained on the toolboxes. Results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journal publications in leading journals in the different fields and international conferences.
The results and learnings of the project will be synthesized in a book publication to address a broader audience. They will contribute to reducing CO2 emission in urban realms by providing a holistic understanding of impacts of large-scale BIPV deployment.
Furthermore, the results will support improving the resilience of cities towards pandemics such as COVID-19, stressing the relevance of a localized energy infrastructure, energy self-sufficiency and autarky. Within the cluster, our work links to the modules of A1: Circular Future Cities (LCA perspective) and A3: Dense and Green Cities (building / urban typologies and envelope). Future Cities Lab Global

2,Dense and Green Cities,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/dense-and-green-cities.html,,"Contemporary urban planning and design practice is increasingly exploring the development of sustainable integrated districts (SIDs) as a model for high-density high-liveability future cities. SIDs aim to fully realise the potential of urban innovations and systems solutions by deploying and integrating them at the district scale. Density and sustainability in SIDs are seen as mutually dependent and synergistic.
In addition, SIDs often serve as a test bed for examining a placed-based approach to governance arrangements. The place-based approach focuses on strengthening local human capacity – through collaboration and mutual learning – among the diverse stakeholders that are involved in planning and implementing the SIDs.
This research module investigates and evaluates currently ongoing and planned examples of such developments through case studies in Europe and Asia. These include Zurich-West, Switzerland; and one-north, Singapore as main case studies as well as Zurich-Nord, Switzerland; Jurong Lake District and Punggol Town/Digital District, Singapore; Les Lumières Pleyel, Paris, France; Zuidas, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and King’s Cross Central, London, UK as possible additional case studies. 

 This research will capture important aspects of the urban planning and design, architectural, social, environmental, economic and governance systems performance of SIDs systematically through work packages led by an interdisciplinary team of architects, engineers and scientists and close collaboration with competent stakeholders from government agencies and industry.
It will further allow for the evaluation, comparison, and mutual learning regarding how SIDs are planned and realised in different settlement systems (with a focus on Concentrated Settlement Systems) and different climate zones. The emphasis of the research will be on Zurich and Singapore, two cities that both rank highly on liveability indexes and that are both characterised by a world-class vibrant urban research and design culture yet resulting from different governance approaches.
Building on the results of the previous two FCL phases, the research will expand the knowledge on SIDs as an effective model for future urban development. In addition to identifying the factors for the successful implementation of SIDs, this module will also examine planning instruments and governance arrangements that enable such developments in different socio-spatial contexts.

3,Urban BioCycles Mycelium Digitalisation,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/urban-biocycles-mycelium-digitalisation.html,,"The worldwide economic and ecological development of our future is strongly connected to the question of where our resources for future prosperity come from. As our mines run dry and CO2 levels reach alarming levels, our thinking needs to be radically different in all economic sectors.

 The building industry alone is responsible for 40% of global solid waste production, for 40% of the use of primary energy resources and for 40% of CO2 emissions worldwide. Even in current times, natural resources are extracted from the earth and disposed of in a linear process. They are literally consumed rather than being temporarily borrowed from natural or socio-technical circuits. 

 This approach has profound consequences for our planet, that will be further aggravated if we do not adopt a more circular process. Ecosystems are destroyed, the climate is jeopardised, and many resources – such as sand, gravel, copper and zinc – will soon no longer be available in economically reasonable terms. To address this issue, we need to build an environment that is truly sustainable using alternative construction materials and systems.

 In this module, the researchers aim to develop new sustainable technologies by combining composite materials that comprise cultivated, grown and harvested natural resources with digital fabrication methods. Mycelium material grown from fungi is one of the materials of choice for this enterprise, as well as subtractive processes and 3D-printing (3DP). Along with materials and fabrication, a careful assessment of the sustainability and likelihood for application in the construction sector will be studied. Future Cities Lab Global

4,The Sea-​City Interface,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/sea-city-interface.html,,"The Sea-City Interface focuses on the sea-city fringes in rapidly urbanising cities in tropical Asia, where coastal regions interplay. The threat of increasing shocks and stresses induced by climate change and excessive CO2 emissions is well-known. At the same time, demographers show that urban population growth is at its most intense in tropical coastal regions of Asian cities. These regions, as strategic locations, are developed as logistic hubs where ports and airports are often concentrated. This combination of environmental, demographic and logistical factors places stress particularly on the zones where urban development meets the sea - the sea-city interface.

 The module will focus on three broad areas. First, it will develop measures to mitigate climate change and reduce its effects. This is done through improved regenerative approaches to urban design and planning, environmental science, and building biomimicry technology to capture, absorb, store and remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Second, it will develop practical and scalable nature-based approaches for cities in the tropical Asian region to mitigate the effects of rising seas through urban design and biophilic approaches for water-sensitive design. Finally, the research will consider the economic aspects of the sea-city interface, focusing on how these zones can combine their historical manufacturing roles with emerging hybrid developments towards a creative economy that supports diverse industries and promotes liveability.

5,Resilient Blue-​Green Infrastructures,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/resilient-blue-green-infrastructures.html,,"Enabling transformation towards liveable and climate-resilient flood-prone landscapes of tropical cities Much of the world’s urbanisation is occurring in the hinterlands of cities. Infrastructure development is, however, not keeping up with the rapid and mostly unplanned changes. This has resulted in an increasing number of urban dwellers living in under-served areas and may ultimately lead to a global infrastructure crisis.
Many communities compensate by relying on local waterways and green areas to meet basic needs including food, water, sanitation, and recreational spaces. While blue and green infrastructures are increasingly recognised as necessary strategies to relieve the lack of infrastructures, they are not sufficiently seen as assets worth building and maintaining in the fabric of fast-changing cities and their hinterlands.
The overall goal of the Resilient Blue-Green Infrastructures module is thus to design and plan feasible blue and green infrastructures that would not only improve urban water efficiency and reduce flooding. They would also support local food production, mitigate heat island effects, improve water pollution control, provide recreation, promote biodiversity, provide jobs for citizens, and ultimately, improve the quality of life for citizens.
By reinforcing and/or introducing these nature-based (green) storm water management (blue) in the urban fabric, the hinterlands could become more resilient to climate change and population growth. Future Cities Lab Global

6,Agropolitan Territories of Monsoon Asia,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/agropolitan-territories-of-monsoon-Asia.html,,"Urbanisation with an agropolitan outlook, foregrounding the inter-dependence of future cities and future agriculture The Agropolitan Territories of Monsoon Asia module addresses the unsustainable relationship between urbanisation and food production in monsoon Asia. Globally, urban land expansion is consuming fertile agricultural land at unprecedented rates. Simultaneously, the industrialised agricultural practices developed to meet the food needs of urbanised populations are placing pressure on a range of ecological systems. A future based on this pattern would be disastrous, not only for already vulnerable regions, but also for the planet. 

This research seeks to develop an ‘agropolitan’ outlook to urbanisation, which foregrounds the inter-dependence of future cities and future agriculture. It will do so by developing transdisciplinary and multi-scaled approaches to data collection and analysis, dynamic planning support tools (combining artificial intelligence and participatory planning), and designs and prototypes for sustainable agropolitan territories.

 The focus of the study is Monsoon Asia, where urbanisation is rapid and intense, and where most of the world’s staple cereals are grown (90% of the world’s rice, 45% wheat, and 25% maize). Within this region, we will focus on a selection of complex, polycentric settlement networks in China, India and Indonesia, considering the knowledge exchange possibilities between these regions and Singapore’s emerging expertise in food-secure urban planning.

7,New Urban Agendas under Planetary Urbanisation,https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/new-urban-agendas-planetary-urbanisation.html,,"Designing sustainable agri-urbanisms What is the future of the manifold agricultural territories across the world that support contemporary cities? While discussions on urban sustainability have focused on cities and urban regions, many agricultural territories are equally exposed to rapid and far-reaching urban transformation processes with massive social and environmental implications, opening a research gap for ‘agri-urbanisms’. 

 The New Urban Agendas under Planetary Urbanisation module aims to address the gap by analysing selected processes of ‘extended urbanisation’ in agricultural territories across Europe and Asia in three typical forms of extended urbanisation: 1) operationalised landscapes of industrial agriculture; 2) peripheralised mountain regions; and 3) enclosed and fragmented agricultural landscapes in extended metropolitan regions. 

 The module combines detailed qualitative analysis with quantitative geospatial analysis and modelling, thereby linking the social, political and cultural aspects of urbanisation to transformations in land use patterns, soil ecosystems and ecosystem services. Building on analytical investigation, the module also aims to develop large-scale urban-territorial design strategies and governance models for ‘agri-urbanisms’, based on the principles of agroecology and sustainable urban development.
